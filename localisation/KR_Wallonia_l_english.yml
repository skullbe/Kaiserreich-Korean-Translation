### Events ###

wll.1.t:0 "플랜더스-왈로니아의 해체"
wll.1.d:0 "플랜더스는 우리 왕국에서 분리독립을 선언했습니다. 독일인 시민들과 왕실은 이 지역을 떠나 우리나라에 대한 그들의 지배력을 다시 확립하고 있습니다. 한편 혁명은 여전히 계속되고 있으며 끝이 보이지 않아 이 지역을 불안정하게 만들고 있습니다. 우리나라를 파괴하려는 적의를 피하기 위해서는 신속하고 결정적인 조치가 필요할 것입니다. 왈로니아 자본가와 진보주의자들은 혁명을 두려워하지만, 독일인들의 통치 역시 불만스러운 눈으로 바라보고 있습니다. 지난 10년동안 공화국을 건설하려 했던 그들의 노력은 지금껏 실패해왔지만, 이제는 새로운 기회가 등장했을지도 모릅니다."
wll.1.a:0 "깃발을 올려라, 왈로니아가 태어났다."

wll.2.t:0 "세랭에서의 갈등"
wll.2.d:0 "실론 산업 전체에 걸쳐 폭동과 시위가 벌어지면서, 생디칼리스트 레지스탕스들은 12명의 행정부 인질을 잡은 채 공장 재개를 허락하지 않으며 세랭 제철소에 숨어 있습니다. 플랜더스에서 철수하는 군인들이 나뮈르 인근에 모여들고 있지만, 이 문제를 해결하기 위해 리에주로 파견될 수도 있습니다. 한편, 이 회사의 주주들은 정부에게 이 시설을 온전하게 놔두라고 필사적으로 촉구하고 있으며 그들의 이익을 보존하기 위해 가능한 한 많은 로비를 하고 있습니다."
wll.2.a:0 "세랭에 군을 투입하라."
wll.2.b:0 "극좌들의 요구를 들어 보자."

wll.3.t:0 "생디칼리스트와의 협상"
wll.3.d:0 "제철소 안에 갇힌 반군 지도자들 중 한 명이 나와서 그들의 요구사항을 전달했습니다. 그들은 만약 왕이 1935년 파업 기간에 합의되었던 사항들을 준수하고, 약속된 주 40시간 근무제를 제정하는 새로운 노동법에 서명하며, 보다 투명한 직원-고용자 관계를 제공하는 대책을 세우면 공장을 원상복구시키겠다고 약속했습니다. 자유당은 이미 자유무역에 대한 억압과 특권 침해를 이유로 이 요구에 대해 반대 의사를 표명했습니다. 하지만 그들의 요구를 수용한다면, 우리는 완전한 생디칼리슴 혁명의 세력을 약화시킬 수 있을 것이고, 보다 진보적인 POB 회원들의 마음을 바꿀 수 있을 것입니다."
wll.3.a:0 "그들의 요구에 동의하라."
wll.3.b:0 "협상을 중단하라."
wll.3.c:0 "펠트젠다메리를 보내라."

#Stalled Negotiations

wll.31.t:0 "정지된 협상"
wll.31.d:0 "생디칼리스트들의 요구가 받아들여진지 이틀이 지났지만 정부는 아직까지 아무런 답변을 하지 않고 있습니다. 이 상황에 대한 소식은 전국에 산불처럼 퍼졌고 비슷한 행동이 샤를루아의 유리 공장에서 이루어졌으며 심지어 무기 생산업체 FN을 공격하기도 했습니다. 상황은 끓어오르는 시점에 도달하고 있으며 에노에서의 테러 공격 때문에 우리는 지금 행동해야 합니다. 그렇지 않으면 군대는 대규모 폭동에 맞서기엔 너무 흩어져버리게 될 것입니다. 우리의 지휘관들은 우리에게 세랭의 파업자들을 본보기로 삼아, 군대를 보내서 그들을 요새에서 몰아내라고 권하고 있습니다. 자유당의 운동가들은 여전히 왕에게 난폭하게 행동하지 말라고 경고하고 있으며, 왕에게 중도를 추구하라고 충고하고 있습니다."
wll.31.a:0 "펠트젠다메리를 보내라."
wll.31.b:0 "노동법의 축소판에 서명하라."

wll.32.t:0 "노동법 채택"
wll.32.d:0 "근로조건 개선 약속과 노동법 발표로, 많은 소규모 파업이 진정되었고, 너무 많은 피해는 주지 않은 채로 공장을 떠났습니다. 그러나 세랭의 파업자들은 여전히 버티고 있으며 다시 한번 정부가 노동법에 서명하거나 즉시 사임할 것을 요구하고 있습니다. 지난 10년간 영향력이 크게 높아진 POB는 생디칼리스트들의 요구에 동참해 정부의 즉각적인 퇴진을 요구해 왔습니다."
wll.32.a:0 "우리는 자유당의 지지를 얻어야 한다!"

wll.33.t:0 "자유당이 지원을 거부하다"
wll.33.d:0 "기회를 엿본 자유당은 자신들의 입장을 고수하기로 결정했고 사퇴 요구에 힘을 실어주기 위해 POB에 동참했습니다. 그들은 지금의 이 위기를 해결할 수 있는 유일한 방법은 국민의 소리에 귀를 기울이고 긴급 선거를 치르는 것이라고 주장하고 있습니다."
wll.33.a:0 "이제부터는 어디서 지원을 받아야 하지?"

wll.34.t:0 "라 루비에르의 항의"
wll.34.d:0 "It appears that in La Louvière thousands of disgruntled miners have come down to the town square to protest against the pro-German government and to demand Adelbert's abdication. Feldgendarmerie have been keeping watch on the protest and so far have been able to discourage violence between the Walloons and the much smaller counterprotest by German citizens. Though only small in size, the protest marks the end of an era. Further protests around the nation are already being organised and a general strike has now kept the nation paralysed for two weeks. The situation is becoming completely untenable with many Germans leaving the nation to avoid repression by the syndicalists."
wll.34.a:0 "군주제가 흔들리고 있다!"

wll.35.t:0 "나뮈르 행군"
wll.35.d:0 "Further protests are engulfing the nation, with many people leaving their homes to gather on the streets of Namur. A product of the prestigious regional glass industry, a life-sized sculpture of Adelbert has been toppled in the town square and symbolically smashed to bits with mining pickaxes. Though police were able to arrest the perpetrators it was already too late as shards of glass were quickly grabbed by bystanders permanently memorialising the events of the day."
wll.35.a:0 "우리는 궁전을 요새화해야 한다."

wll.36.t:0 "Royal Councillor Resigns"
wll.36.d:0 "Not willing to risk his life for that of his king anymore, the royal councillor has announced his resignation and was seen leaving the palace to loud applause. The Feldgendarmerie have been used to push the crowd away from the fences and avoid violent escalation. Their efforts have been met by a grand crowd-driven performance of the Chant Des Wallons"
wll.36.a:0 "Summon Parliament to the Palace."

wll.37.t:0 "Final Royal Meeting"
wll.37.d:0 "Only a small faction of politicians with nearly no members of the POB has answered the call and have come to attend what may be the last Royal Meeting. The King asked every single person in the room whether they believe his current predicament is solvable. He was met with no clear response until the leader of the Liberal Party, Auguste Buisseret, stepped forward and told the King that there was no way he would be able to return to power. The people have spoken and it's abdication they demand. Only then will we be able to calm down the populace and resume our work."
wll.37.a:0 "Abdication is the only dignified way out."
wll.37.b:0 "But what about a referendum?"

wll.38.t:0 "Referendum Refused"
wll.38.d:0 "In a last ditch effort to retain power Adelbert requested the government hold a referendum on the future of the monarchy but was turned down. Support for the King has almost reached single digits, making a costly referendum pointless. The proposal was put to a vote and unanimously voted down. The reign of King Adelbert is over."
wll.38.a:0 "Sign the abdication papers."

wll.39.t:0 "King Adelbert I Abdicates"
wll.39.d:0 "Turned down by both the Flemish and the Walloons, Adelbert has finally given in and at 4pm put down his final signature as King of the Flemish and Walloons. Although German rule is far from over, the monarchy has reached its end."
wll.39.a:0 "Hoist the Cok Wallon!"

wll.310.t:0 "First Walloon Elections"
wll.310.d:0 "After two decades of strict German rule, the first free elections have been held. Even the syndicalist branch of the POB has been allowed to participate and has spend the last week desperately amassing as much popularity as possible. The PL has also gathered substantial support and is particularly popular around the city of Namur and among the remaining German minority. However no party seems capable of achieving an absolute majority and a political impasse may drag on for multiple weeks if no agreement is reached."
wll.310.a:0 "The POB wins the election."
wll.310.b:0 "The PL wins a close victory."

wll.311.t:0 "PL Wins the Most Seats"
wll.311.d:0 "Closely beating the POB and the Catholics, the PL under its leader Auguste Buisseret has won the most seats and been given the right to begin forming a government. While a Catholic-Liberal alliance is the most likely outcome, the POB has offered to assist the PL if they can guarantee more freedom for the worker class and immediately pass the Labour Act through Parliament. A so-called 'Red-Yellow alliance' would grant almost complete control over the government but may be more difficult to keep intact than a Swedish coalition."
wll.311.a:0 "The real work starts now."

#Give in to their demands

wll.41.t:0 "Adelbert Caves in to the Strikers"
wll.41.d:0 "With his back against the wall and his position as strong sovereign growing increasingly fragile, King Adelbert has agreed to sign the Labour Act. The syndicalists left their position and their leader could be seen shaking hands with the King, publicly indicating a curious softening of Adelbert's absolutist obsession."
wll.41.a:0 "The Labour Act is signed."

wll.42.t:0 "Support for the King Increases"
wll.42.d:0 "Impressed by the decisive actions of their King, Parliament gave a standing ovation on their next sitting. The leader of the POB, Fernand Dehousse, gave a speech openly praising Adelbert and announcing his push for a more democratic constitutional monarchy."
wll.42.a:0 "Public adulation, interesting..."

wll.43.t:0 "Truce Offered to the Resistance"
wll.43.d:0 "With the Liège province partially pacified, Adelbert has offered a truce to the syndicalist resistance which still fiercly defends the western villages of Hainaut. Promising a royal pardon and the option for them to create their own legal party, the King has demanded a complete end to hostilities. The syndicalist rebels however have refused this offer and increased their raids on our military camps."
wll.43.a:0 "They have had their chance."

wll.44.t:0 "Syndicalist Resistance Crushed"
wll.44.d:0 "After the syndicalist refusal, a strike force consisting of both Walloon and German troops was assembled with orders to push into Mons and secure the city while the detachments flanked the rebels, enveloped them and began successfully clearing the villages street by street. Though two weeks of heavy fighting ensued, in the end we regained control with relatively minimal casualties."
wll.44.a:0 "The Syndicalists have been defeated for now."

#Send in the Feldgendarmerie

wll.51.t:0 "Troops Storm Seraing"
wll.51.d:0 "Just like last year Adelbert has yet again given the order to disperse any protesters violently and break up the strikes with force. Within two hours the factory complex was cleared of all opposition. The floor is red with blood as the last of the syndicalists are slaughtered, a clear warning to all others willing to protest."
wll.51.a:0 "The resistance will be quelled again."

wll.52.t:0 "Mons Liberated"
wll.52.d:0 "After our defeat at Mons during the Belgian revolution, our troops have been licking their wounds. Now they are however fully prepared and ready to attack the syndicalist barricades."
wll.52.a:0 "Fire at will, men."

wll.53.t:0 "POB Banned From Parliament"
wll.53.d:0 "Though no clear connection can be found between the moderate faction of the POB who has been part of the government since 1919 and the radical syndicalist splinter faction, Adelbert has signed a royal decree outlawing the party and kicking it out of the government. Although loud protests erupted as expected, all were quelled by the prospect of prison."
wll.53.a:0 "Another step towards the end of Syndicalism."

wll.54.t:0 "A New Wallonia"
wll.54.d:0 "Much has changed during the last two weeks, with the remaining syndicalist cells being destroyed and mass arrests throughout the Sillon Industriel. Experts estimate the death toll at about 15,300 citizens and the arrest of around 800 leading members of the organisation. German control has once again been largely established in Wallonia, kept intact by a regime of fear and repression."
wll.54.a:0 "I think a toast is in order."

wll.55.t:0 "Royal Councillor Appointed"
wll.55.d:0 "While the power of Parliament has been curbed they still retain some power. Therefore we still need our royal councillor to keep an eye on them. While Thilo von Wilmowsky has served us well for many years, he seems to have a faltering resolve and may be in need of a replacement. Much of our power in Parliament is based around the Catholic Party which has proposed a candidate to succeed Reeder. The Liberals have also announced their favorite and are pressing Adelbert to make a choice."
wll.55.a:0 "Von Wilmowsky will remain councillor."
wll.55.b:0 "The Catholic candidate gets chosen."
wll.55.c:0 "The Liberal candidate gets chosen."

#Lobbying with Germany

wll.6.t:0 "Search For Assistance Against Flanders"
wll.6.d:0 "The political situation has stabilised and the economy is slowly recovering, yet much remains to be done. Flanders, which declared its independence during the Belgian Revolution, is still a rightful part of our country. However ti has fallen out of our sphere of influence and is now a direct member of the Reichspakt. Only by carefully manoeuvring our way on the German political battlefield can we secure their support for the reunification."
wll.6.a:0 "Send word to Germany."

wll.61.t:0 "Wallonia Requests Our Support"
wll.61.d:0 "After the chaos of the Belgian revolution, the nation of Flanders-Wallonia split into two separate states. The Dutch speaking region of Flanders has successfully achieved its seperation from the union and has become a somewhat autonomous member of the Reichspakt. Wallonia however is still under our more direct control and has finally defeated the revolution. Now they request our aid in reconquering their lost land and reuniting Flanders-Wallonia. While this may reestablish our rule over the region it may lead to further trouble in the future. Denial of their request may once again throw the nation into turmoil as the power of the government may be called into question."
wll.61.a:0 "Support the Walloon cause."
wll.61.b:0 "No, the Flemish are goood allies."

wll.62.t:0 "Germany Supports Us"
wll.62.d:0 "The Kaiser has seen the right way and has acceded to our request. No German aid will be sent to Flanders in case of war and no other members of the Reichspakt will be allowed to intervene."
wll.62.a:0 "Prepare the invasion."

wll.63.t:0 "Germany Denies Our Request"
wll.63.d:0 "The Kaiser has denied our request and expelled the emmisaries who came up with this supposedly ridiculous idea. If we attack Flanders, we can be sure to feel the full wrath of the German behemoth. Unrest is already brewing in Parliament with many seeing this as the first signs of weakness. We will have to tread carefully to counter nationalist uprisings."
wll.63.a:0 "Wilhelm has failed us!"

#The Government has Failed!

wll.7.t:0 "The Government is Failing!"
wll.7.d:0 "After the disastrous campaign to gather support against Flanders and the failure to completely solve the syndicalist problem, nationalists are flocking to the banner of Léon Degrelle who promises Wallonia for the Walloons and a strong answer to syndicalism. While the Liberals have already spoken against his outrageous populism, the Catholics seem to be unsure about whether to speak out against him. Trouble is also brewing in the army where many who joined up to defeat the Flemish are disappointed by their government and are requesting a stronger response."
wll.7.a:0 "Arrest Degrelle!"

wll.71.t:0 "Arrest of Degrelle"
wll.71.d:0 "Although Degrelle was easily captured by our police force, this has caused massive outrage across the cities. Many see this as curbing of freedom of speech and Rexist propaganda is starting to appear on every street corner with small skirmishes occuring between police and members when caught."
wll.71.a:0 "This situation is starting to escalate."

wll.72.t:0 "Trouble at the University of Liège"
wll.72.d:0 "The populist rhetoric of Degrelle has spread far and wide and has become a breeding ground for students having trouble finding work after the Black Monday crisis. Peaceful protests are being organised on campus and in the streets calling for his release and the creation of new jobs."
wll.72.a:0 "Disperse the crowds."

wll.73.t:0 "Mutiny in the Army"
wll.73.d:0 "In many of the smaller kazernes troups conscripted specifically for the unification wars, Walloon soldiers seem to be plotting against their German commanders. Disobeying orders and deliberately damaging military equipment seems to have become popular passtimes amongst our young soldiery."
wll.73.a:0 "Disperse these regiments across the nation."

wll.74.t:0 "Message From the Vatican"
wll.74.d:0 "The pope has decided to interfere in the Degrelle case calling for clemency. It appears that supporters of Rex were able to reach the nuntius of München, Eugenio Pacelli who contacted the pope. Impressed by Degrelles' devotion to God, the Holy Father has requested that our government grant Degrelle clemency. It would be in our best interests to keep this request secret as it may cause severe trouble if this leaks out. Cardinal Mercier has offered to speak on the prime minister's behalf in Parliament denying the whole affair."
wll.74.a:0 "Allow Mercier to go ahead."

wll.75.t:0 "Betrayed By Mercier!"
wll.75.d:0 "Although his speech was screened by the cabinet and given to him before the speech, Mercier decided to speak out against the government questioning their resolve and explaining the Papal affair in its entirety. This evidently led to outrage in Parliament with supporters of Degrelle demanding his release and praising Mercier for his efforts in whistleblowing about the scandal."
wll.75.a:0 "This is not going too well."

wll.76.t:0 "Release Degrelle?"
wll.76.d:0 "With popular opinion turning against the government and demand for Degrelle's release increasing by the day, we will soon be forced to decide whether to release him and hope that it calms down the crowds gathering in front of Parliament, or keep him imprisoned and risk the people's wrath. The minister for internal affairs however is pushing the prime minister to speed up the trial and have Degrelle executed before the situation gets out of hand."
wll.76.a:0 "Release Degrelle."
wll.76.b:0 "Move the trial forward."

#Degrelle released
wll.77.t:0 "Degrelle Released"
wll.77.d:0 "To avoid further escalation the government has decided not to press their case against Degrelle and dropped charges against him. Although this act served initially to stem the growing unrest, most of the damage has already been done. Pictures showing a frail and weakened Degrelle leaving the prison are front page news across the entire country. Rexists in the government are pushing for a motion of no confidence saying that the current government clearly doesn't speak for its people and should resign at once. Degrelle himself has in the meantime announced his candidature for prime minister and is helping to fuel the Rexist propaganda machine."
wll.77.a:0 "A catastrophe!"

wll.78.t:0 "The Motion of No Confidence Succeeds!"
wll.78.d:0 "Defeated in a motion of no confidence by 103 to 75, the entire cabinet has reluctantly resigned and the government has fallen. Early elections have been called for the end of the month while all regular government affairs have ceased. It has already become clear that this going to be a close election with REX appearing to be on the verge of becoming the largest party in Wallonia."
wll.78.a:0 "The POB, DC and PL band together."
wll.78.b:0 "The DC speaks out in favour of Degrelle."

wll.79.t:0 "Rex Wins the Election!"
wll.79.d:0 "Rex has become the largest party in Wallonia closely followed by the POB. Though Rex failed to reach an outright majority, with support from the DC a working coalition has been established. The POB and PL have called for a recount but have been turned down by the Courts, with the judges stating that REX has won fair and square."
wll.79.a:0 "Degrelle assumes control."

wll.710.t:0 "The Grand Coalition Wins the Election!"
wll.710.d:0 "By combining their efforts and denouncing REX, the grand coalition of POB, DC and PL was able to win the election. REX only achieved 19% of the votes and has been excluded from the government. Although many of Degrelle's supporters still remain, the party will most likely never achieve the same momentum."
wll.710.a:0 "A victory for democracy!"

#Degrelle goes to trial
wll.711.t:0 "The Trial of Degrelle"
wll.711.d:0 "Thousands have gathered outside Wallonia's highest court as Degrelle is brought before the judge. After many hours of proceedings the judge has finally given his trial verdict. Degrelle has been variously found guilty of committing an attack on the nation aimed at overthrowing or changing its form of government and bringing citizens under arms against the the legal state and its lawfully appointed organs. This assortment of crimes is to be punished by the death penalty, an outcome to be fulfilled before the end of the week."
wll.711.a:0 "Hopefully this means an end to REX."

wll.712.t:0 "Rexist Coup"
wll.712.d:0 "Fueled by the unjust condemnation of Degrelle and the severity of his punishment, ever more supporters have flocked to the Rexist banner. On Sunday night, with most government agencies closed military putschists launched a pro-Rexist coup, lifting the prime minister from his bed and capturing many key military installations. Freed by his supporters Degrelle has declared the begining of a new Rexist era and personally accompanied his troops to capture the last remaining government strongholds. When the sun rose the next day, REX had fulfilled its coup objectives and assumed full control over the state."
wll.712.a:0 "A new era awaits!"

#Downfall of Degrelle
wll.713.t:0 "Degrelle Shot!"
wll.713.d:0 "During a visit to the FN Herstal factory, Léon Degrelle ahs been shot dead by a factory worker. Though his bodyguards immediately returned fire, killing the assailant, with Degrelle rushed to the closest hospital, medical attention came too late and at around 16:00 our great leader died. Due to his consolidation of power over the last few years, it seems that there is no clear successor to his legacy and while the leaders of REX are fighting each other, the other parties smell a chance to recover their lost popularity. Whether or not REX will be able to retain power after the loss of their charismatic leader is to be seen but dark clouds are definitely brewing over Wallonia."
wll.713.a:0 "No doubt REX will tear itself apart now."

wll.714.t:0 "Infighting Within REX"
wll.714.d:0 "In the wake of the death of Degrelle, his second in command Victor Matthys has wrested control of the party to the consternation of other major players like Louis Collard and the minister of propaganda Georges Prosper Remi. Matthys' leadership qualities have quickly be outed as lackluster at best after he decided that the populace can only be kept in line with extreme repression. While it seems order has temporarily been restored, behind the façade of violence resistance keeps brewing and Matthys' rule may be shortlived."
wll.714.a:0 "Yet more turbulence."

wll.715.t:0 "Coup D'état in Wallonia!"
wll.715.d:0 "The succession crisis seems to have finally affected the army, which has risen up in protest against the cruel massacres commissioned by Matthys to eliminate his opponents. Supported by the PL and the POB, officers have ordered their soldiers to disobey all Rexist commands and tanks have been be seen rolling through the avenues of Liège towards the party headquarters. All the same, the remaining hardliners are unwilling to give up so easily and without a surrender by the Rexists a bloodbath is almost inevitable."
wll.715.a:0 "Demand they lay down their weapons."

wll.716.t:0 "Consultation with Remi"
wll.716.d:0 "While Louis Collard has fortified himself with the REX hardliners inside the party headquarters, Georges Prosper Remi has been cooperating with the resistance since Degrelle's death seeking a return to democracy and a peaceful transition of power. While his efforts have proven futile in avoiding armed conflict so far, he still holds some sway within the nation and has convinced many of the other Rexists outside of the capital to surrender themselves to the army. While he has tried mediating with the remaining hardliners, all have come to naught and it seems that they will not go down without a fight."
wll.716.a:0 "Launch the attack."

wll.717.t:0 "Georges Deffontaine Assumes Temporary Control"
wll.717.d:0 "After a short but bloody siege of the party headquarters, the army has emerged victorious and has proclaimed Georges Deffontaine leader of provisionary government until elections are held. The POB and PL have immediately restarted their propaganda efforts and with REX having been disbanded by the military, Georges Prosper Remi has announced that he will be running for office to contain the remaining Rexist elements and help Wallonia on its way towards full democracy."
wll.717.a:0 "We'll prepare elections!"

wll.718.t:0 "Post-REX Elections"
wll.718.d:0 "After the downfall of REX and the military coup, the elections are finally upon us. The POB under Fernand Dehousse has been polling excellently but has received some hits due to a damaging scandal concerning one of their party members. Auguste Buisseret is also doing well with his message of liberal democracy and has attracted many of the German capitalists. Georges Prosper Remi is, to the surprise of many, still following closely as well and might even pull a close victory out of the elections with his message of solidarity and national unity."
wll.718.a:0 "Fernand Dehousse and the POB."
wll.718.b:0 "Auguste Buisseret and the PL."
wll.718.c:0 "Georges Prosper Remi and the UNW."

#POB wins the elections

wll.8.t:0 "POB Wins the Election"
wll.8.d:0 "Unsurprising to many, the POB was able to sway the voters and win a landslide victory. Internal strife however is damaging the party and long discussions can be heard in parliament discussing the future of the socialist party. Subfactions under Lucie Dejardin, Julien Lahaut and Walter Dauge are damaging Fernand Dehousse standing and may force his hand into a dangerous position. The syndicalists demand a quick and painless revolution while the more conservative faction prefers upholding the status quo with small socialist reforms."
wll.8.a:0 "Difficult negotiations are approaching."

wll.81.t:0 "Question of Leadership"
wll.81.d:0 "As the POB tries to settle in and form its cabinet, a motion of no confidence has been proclaimed against Fernand Dehousse calling him a traitor to the working class and unfit to rule. Though the syndicalist members support this motion, other sub-factions led by Julien Lahaut and Walter Dauge are less inclined to support them as this would result in syndicalist dominance within the party."
wll.81.a:0 "Fernand Dehousse remains head of the Party."
wll.81.b:0 "Lucie Dujardin becomes Chairwoman."

wll.82.t:0 "Bloodbath at Liège"
wll.82.d:0 "With no consensus within the POB, members of the extremist syndicalist and totalist factions have decided to handle the matters their own way. During yet another failing meeting between Fernand Dehousse and members of a new social liberal faction, masked assailants stormed the room butchering Fernand Dehousse and his staff. Over sixty high-ranking members of the POB were massacred after which the assailants left. Shocked by these events, Parliament has announced a day of national sorrow mourning the casualties of the attack."
wll.82.a:0 "Chaos reigns once more."

wll.83.t:0 "Lahaut Assumes Control"
wll.83.d:0 "With all opposition dealt with and no immediate response from the moderate syndicalists, Julien Lahaut has taken control of the POB and is starting to push for full on revolution, breaking the chains and liberating the worker class from capitalist oppression."
wll.83.a:0 "Dark times are upon us."

wll.84.t:0 "Military Disbanded"
wll.84.d:0 "To avoid problems with the military, Lahaut has fired all officers and cut off their funding. Only a small faction called the Red Guard ahs been allowed to remain extant, a praetorian guard consisting of Lahaut's fiercest supporters."
wll.84.a:0 "The military has been dismantled."

wll.12.d:0 "In the days leading up to the contentious election, all parties are scrambling their best propaganda teams to advocate their strengths and denounce the others. Their main focus seems to be to portray the PL-DC coalition as the enemy and to try and instill fear in the working class."
wll.12.a:0 "The election is approaching!"

wll.121.t:0 "PL의 프로파간다"
wll.121.d:0 "The PL has focused on countering the fear instilled into the middle class by the Catholics against the Socialists. 'Carnaval... after Easter, the Citizen has become wise enough to see through these lies!'"

wll.122.t:0 "REX의 프로파간다"
wll.122.d:0 "Led by their mildly popular leader Degrelle, REX is seeking to sway voters by promising the complete cleanup, or 'groote kuisch' of career politicians and to restore Wallonia to its true Belgian borders."

wll.123.t:0 "DC의 프로파간다"
wll.123.d:0 "Afraid of Catholics voting against them and for REX, DC has launched a smear campaign against Degrelle calling him alternately confused 'dwaashoofd' and mad with power, 'macht'."

wll.124.t:0 "POB의 프로파간다"
wll.124.d:0 "To remember the workers of the pre-Weltkrieg situation, POB has sought to present the image of the failed PL-DC and their cronies drowning in failures. 'After their failure to hold Belgium, do you still trust them?'"

wll.125.d:0 "'The time for socialism is now. The PL-DC are stuck in the past where the POB looks to the future! So the reign of money can end and the reign of the worker may commence!'"

wll.131.d:0 "Created by scientists from all Walloon Universities and even the Flemish, Ion Beam Applications has been launched aimed at boosting the high tech industry of Wallonia. With a large focus on prosthetics and cyclotron, they hope to revolutionise the niche and take the world by storm."

wll.1311.a:0 "Great success!"

wll.1312.t:0 "Investment Failed!"
wll.1312.d:0 "With the subsidies IBA has tried to enter the German market but was forced to sign harsh terms with their government and has been blocked off from further expansion.

wll.1321.t:0 "Request From the Union Minière"
wll.1321.d:0 "While the Belgian government lost our colony after the Weltkrieg, most of the Congolese economy is still controlled by our corporations. The Union Minière du Haut Katanga is the largest amongst them and has established itself as one of the world's most important players on the resource market. Mittelafrikan meddling however is starting to interfere with their interests and their government has imposed restrictions on the company. Therefore they have decided to withdraw most of their funds and to take loans with Walloon banks instead of German ones. To achieve this though, they will need support from our government and an adaption to our laws to enable them an easy transfer. While the benefits may be huge, we have to tread carefully to avoid German wrath."

wll.1322.d:0 "To support our citizens and the UMHK abroad, the government has drafted up a proposal for Mittelafrika. They request easier access to the mines, permission to build infrastructure in Kongo and to lease the harbour of Boma to our nation. In return, UMHK will pay an increased amount of tax and will build housing, hospitals and schools for the local population.

They request easier access to the mines, permission to build infrastructure in Kongo and to lease the harbour of Boma to their nation. In return, UMHK will pay an increased amount of tax and will build housing, hospitals and schools for the local population. A new trade agreement will be signed increasing Walloon import from Mittelafrika while also granting more favourable arrangements for our government. Due to the economic troubles we are experiencing, allowing the Flemish-Walloons to invest in our nation would be hugely beneficial but would also increase their influence over the Congolese region. Turning them down however would be very costly as a very substantial part of our economy depends on the UMHK."
wll.1323.a:0 "A bold but welcome suggestion!"
wll.1323.b:0 "We don't sign agreements with non-entities."

wll.1324.t:0 "Mittelafrika Accepts"
wll.1324.d:0 "Mittelafrika seems to have agreed to our terms and have once more given UMHK free reign over the provinces of Congo. Our request to the harbour of Boma has however been refused for the time until we have accomplished our part of the bargain."
wll.1324.a:0 "Very well!"

wll.1325.t:0 "Mittelafrika Refuses!"
wll.1325.d:0 "It appears that the brutish Mittelafrikan regime refused all of our demands and has even increased the taxes levied on our firms by another two percent.

WLL_The_Sillon_Industriel_desc:0 "The Sillon Industriel is the industrial heartland of Wallonia, it's output unparalleled.

WLL_Create_The_Industrial_Commitee:0 "Create the Industrial Committee"
WLL_Create_The_Industrial_Commitee_desc:0 "The nation's many great industrial companies compete vigorously for the slightest economic advantage.
