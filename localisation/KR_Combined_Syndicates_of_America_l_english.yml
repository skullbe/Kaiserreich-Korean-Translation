POLITICS_CSA_CENTRAL_COMITTEE_DESC:0 "노동자 계층의 승리는 모든 진정한 미국인들의 총체적인 승리입니다. 그 간절한 목표는 끝내 이뤄냈지만, 헌법의 아버지들이 그랬듯이, 옛 미국인들, 이제는 사회주의 해방자들은 여전히 중앙위원회를 중심으로 집결해 우리 나라의 미래에 대해 토론하고 있습니다. 동시에 여러 세력들이 존 리드 아래에서 본인들의 미래를 각각 계획하고 있습니다."
POLITICS_ELIZABETH_FLYNN_DESC:0 "할렘가에 있는 먼지투성이의 지하 사회주의 모임에서부터 엘리자베스 플린의 웅변가의 삶이 시작되었습니다. 뉴저지의 세계산업노동자동맹의 초창기 구성원인 플린은 노동조합 형성에 대한 정치적 분노의 무정함을 느꼈고 10번이나 당국에 체포되었습니다. 플린은 국제노동자 변호협회 이전에 파업자들을 위한 법적 변호를 위해 조직된 ACLU의 설립을 도왔습니다. 내전을 앞두고 플린은 서해안 공격 계획을 돕기도 했습니다. 플린이 징병 장려를 위해 중앙 위원회에 보낸 전시 연설이 플린으로 하여금 위원회의 수많은 양심적 병역 거부자들의 눈에 띄게 했습니다. 결국 플린은 충격적인 다크호스 후보로 미국을 이끌기 위해 선출되었습니다. 몇몇 사람들은 여성이 혁명의 최전선에 서는 것은 터무니없다고 생각했지만, 이 반항적인 처녀는 산업노동자동맹 설립 이후 내내 선두에 서서 싸웠으며 이제 그녀 자신이 생각하던 사회주의 미국을 건설할 준비가 되었습니다."
POLITICS_NORMAN_THOMAS_DESC:0 "노먼 토마스는 사회적 지위가 낮을 때이건 높을 때이건 사회주의에 헌신해왔습니다. 그는 신문팔이 소년에서부터 프린스턴 대학 우등을 거쳐 양심적 병역 거부자에 이르기까지의 인생을 살아왔습니다. 내전 이전의 그는 뉴욕시 시장이자 잭 리드의 부통령 후보로 일했었습니다. 전쟁 동안의 토마스는 자신의 평화주의적 사상을 통해 연방측 지역에 살고 있는 사회주의자들로 하여금 징병에 저항하도록 헌신했습니다. 전쟁이 끝난 후, 그는 자신의 학력과 잭 리드와의 친밀한 우정을 이용해 연방주의자들을 대신해서 헌법 회의에서 민주적 사회주의자들을 승리로 이끌기 위해 연설했습니다. 황금률 그 자체이자 행동하는 양심으로 불리는 노먼 토마스는 의장직에 올랐습니다."
POLITICS_EARL_BROWDER_DESC:0 "1891년 캔자스에서 태어난 브라우더는 열여섯살 때 열렬한 사회주의자가 되었습니다. 미국 사회당에 대한 브라우더의 집념은 흔들리지 않았고, 초창기에는 윌리엄 Z 포스터와의 우정을 통해 그는 생디칼리스트가 되었습니다. 그러나 세월이 흐르면서 두 사람의 사이가 멀어지기 시작했습니다. 포스터는 권위주의적 형태의 생디칼리슴을 선호했지만, 브라우더는 이 움직임에 점점 더 많은 한계을 보이기 시작했습니다. 브라우더에 따르면 유럽에서 적용되는 것과 같은 신념과 전략은 미국에는 적용될 수 없음을 미국 혁명이 증명했다고 합니다. 그의 신경제정책은 볼셰비즘으로부터의 영감, 맑스주의 재해석, 그리고 많은 독창적인 생각들로 구축되었습니다. 브라우더는 의회에서 끈질긴 산업노조 활동 경향을 종식시키고자 하며, 사회주의 국가 내에서 종교 활동을 도입하고자 합니다. 브라우더는 결코 미국 사회당을 저버린 적이 없지만, 새로운 권위주의 입장을 통해 그는 당이 자신을 결코 저버리지 않도록 만들려고 합니다."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_FOSTER_DESC:0 "극단적인 노동운동 조직가이자 미국 생디칼리슴 운동의 거두인 윌리엄 Z. 포스터는 실제로 미국 좌파의 전설과도 같은 인물입니다. 20세기 초 벌어진 여러 파업에서 보여준 지도력과 미국사회당이 생디칼리슴 정책을 택하겠다는 약속으로 인해 생디칼리슴과 포스터 사이에 자연스러운 연관성이 형성되었습니다. 그가 발표한 유명한 선언인 "생디칼리슴 미국을 향해서"는 오늘날 미국을 어떻게 재건해야 하는가에 대한 포스터의 이상을 담고 있는데, 모든 국내의 열정적인 전체주의자들을 이끄는 지침서가 되었습니다. 최근 노조연합에서 전위운동이 승리했기 때문에 포스터는 새로운 국가를 이끌기 위해 발돋움했습니다. 포스터의 오래되고 야심찬 사상들이 이제 주목을 끌기 시작했습니다. 그는 인간 종족 전체를 사회주의적으로 개혁하고 미국적 도덕을 사회주의적으로 변환해 선봉으로 삼겠다는 계획을 품고 있습니다."
POLITICS_JAMES_CANNON_DESC:0 "Personally mentored by Big Bill Haywood and well versed in the struggles of the American left, James Cannon became an unshakable presence within the socialist party of America. Although initially a fanatic adherent to Bolshevism, the failure of the Russian revolution contrasted with the triumph of the French syndicalists made Cannon adopt a more libertarian view on socialism. As a formal representative of the SPA, he spent much time abroad in France and Britain, before returning to America after the outbreak of the civil war. Helping to organize foreign volunteers and the Internationale's advisers, he cemented his reliability as a brilliant administrator. With the war won, Cannon would immediately start to build the momentum needed to run for president, and has now finally fulfilled his ambition!"
POLITICS_CARLO_TRESCA_DESC:0 "Born to an impoverished family in Italy, Tresca's emigration to America became the first major step in a tumultuous life which saw him soon emerge as Secretary of the Italian Socialist Federation of North America. Having built up a famed reputation as an anarchist, a strike organizer and a community leader among Italian immigrants, Tresca became an integral figure within the IWW. His oratory and legal skills were put to use defending men such as Sacco and Vanzetti, as well as stopping the infiltration and manipulation of trade unions by the Italian Mafia. He spent much time vocally supporting the revolution in his homeland Italy, defending the merits, accomplishments and potentials of the Italian Socialist Republic to his fellow Italian-Americans. With the outbreak of the American Civil War, Carlo Tresca played a key role in the takeover and new administration of New York City, he survived multiple assassination attempts and scores of protests against his campaign for being an Italian immigrant. His prior accomplishments within the Italian Socialist Federation and the IWW has now allowed Carlo Tresca to launch a successful campaign to become President."
POLITICS_ARTURO_GIOVANNITTI_DESC:0 "Born in Abruzzi Italy, Arturo was one of the hundreds of thousands who came to the United states seeking opportunity. Arturo instead found a ripe political climate for expanding workers’ rights. Arturo was there during the 1912 Textile Strike of Lawrence, Massachusetts, where his illegal arrest and subsequent trial in a metal cage became a rallying point for the New England IWW. Arturo was acquitted of all charges, and became a socialist activist, first opposing the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, then the US's entry into the war. During the revolution, Arturo led an Italian American brigade out of New England and into the CSA territory under hostile fire. A talent for speaking and poetry elevated his campaign. Ultimately he was elected President as a true citizen."
POLITICS_MEYER_LONDON_DESC:0 "Born in Tsarist Lithuania under the grip of Russian influence. Meyer's first ambition was to become a Talmudic scholar like his father. The adverse conditions of Russia forced Meyer's family to relocate to New York City, where Meyer became a printer. Printing for Yiddish publications, Meyer had fallen into one such group of radical intellectuals that encouraged him to become a lawyer. Starting in the 1890s, Mayer joined Eugene V. Deb's Social Democratic Party, and was a leading organizer of the 1910 New York Clockmakers Strike. A coalition ticket with Progressives allowed Meyer to become the first of many socialists in Congress. Meyer opposed the U.S's entry into the Weltkrieg, and yet aided the McAdoo administration in promoting militancy. Meyer even angered Jewish labor by promoting partisan Jewish organizations above Zionist labor groups. Meyer went undercover during the Crisis of 36, and re-emerged following the war championing many of the issues he was against. Meyer the pro-Zionist war hawk was much more popular, even against protesters claiming he couldn't run for President as an immigrant."
POLITICS_UPTON_SINCLAIR_DESC:0 "Born in 1878, in Baltimore, Upton was an aspiring author from an early age. In his teens he wrote pulp magazines and poetry to make a living, eventually moving into investigative journalism. His moment in the spotlight came after he spent seven weeks disguised as a worker in Chicago's meatpacking plants, drafting a political expose on the poor labor conditions of the plants. Although Sinclair had hoped to rally the country behind the worker's cause, he instead merely exposed the lack of hygiene in the meatpacking industry, of which he declared "I aimed for the country's heart, but hit them in the stomach". With the profits from his literary career, Sinclair pursued politics in California, launching the "End Poverty In California" campaign. E.P.I.C as it came to be known was not the roaring triumph he had expected, but gave Sinclair enough fame and recognition that he could later pursue a second political career in the new America. Now championing a E.P.I.C movement applied nationwide, Upton Sinclair has won the recent presidential election with a startling margin."
POLITICS_FRANK_LITTLE_DESC:0 "Born to a family of Oklahoma homesteaders, Frank Little moved to California in order to escape the miserable droughts that had ruined his family's land. Him and his brother both became ministers, but in 1905 Frank became a full-time organizer for the IWW. A proud wobbly, he soon struck up a friendship with Elizabeth Gurley Flynn and fought alongside her for the rights of unionized workers across the whole country. Frank narrowly survived two separate attempts at lynching by strike breakers, once in Wisconsin and a second time in Montana. Two instances of nearly being murdered caused Frank Little to lay low for several years, only beginning to show his face again around the mine wars of the early 1920s. His political activism was less provocative, and he avoided any more near-death experiences until the outbreak of the civil war. Although too hold to fight personally, Frank helped organize a series of militias across the Steel Belt, and was later nominated to serve in the new government. From this position, he could launch a campaign for the presidency, which the elderly union man narrowly won."
POLITICS_HARRY_BRIDGES_DESC:0 "Harry Bridges was born in Melbourne, Australia in 1901. When he turned 15, he was first introduced to radical labor politics through the Australian branch of the IWW. Emboldened by his contacts with fellow socialists, along with seeing the general deplorable conditions of the poor around the world, he participated in his first general strike in Australia in 1917. Three years later, in 1920, he would move permanently to the US due to the more plentiful work there. He settled in San Fran where he joined other local activists in reviving the then-defunct International Longeshoremens Association. In 1934 a period of month-long negotiations between the twenty local branches of the ILA and the dock owners of SF broke down when two longshore workers were murdered. Bridges, the leading negotiator for the ILA during the standoff, convinced over 100 San Francisco unions to join together in a General Strike. The ILA fought the city to a standstill, and Harry Bridges was given credit for stopping further police violence. His later Presidential campaign often faced off against protesters who defied the new Amendment giving natural born citizenship to immigrants, and prevailed against them. Using this reputation, he launched a risky but successful campaigned that has lead him to the presidency."
POLITICS_FRANK_JOHNS_DESC:0 "Initially a carpenter from Oregon, Frank Johns became the leading figure of the regional Socialist Labor Party. Running twice for congress and twice for the presidency, Johns seemed doomed to a lifetime of obscurity as a fringe party candidate. That was until he went through a near death experience in 1928, nearly drowning in an attempt to save a young boy whom had fallen in a frigid river. Forced to retire from the Socialist Labor Party in order to recover from the incident, Johns was given enough time to think and plot out a new career. He began to correspond with several members of the Socialist Party of America, and after being released from the hospital he went on to join them as a fiery orator. Emboldened by his heroism and having narrowly avoided death, Johns later threw himself into the second American civil war as a capable and courageous militia leader. Thanks to his military accomplishments and personal reputation, he has now finally been elected president, of a whole new America!"
POLITICS_SEYMOUR_STEDMAN_DESC:0 "It was incomprehensible to many that a simple janitor would go on to become one of the Socialist Party of America's most prominent activists and legal advisers. Initially balancing his job as a janitor at the Northwestern University School of Law with taking evening classes, Stedman managed to pass the bar to became a lawyer in 1891. Although he was at first a democrat, the young Stedman became inducted into socialism when he helped defend Eugene V Debs during American Railway Union's great strike. His lifelong friendship to Debs saw him chosen as the SPA's vice presidential candidate on 1920, and after Debs' death he became a close advisor to Jack Reed. Having now outlived yet another close comrade, the old and somber Stedman has run a successful race to become the new president, intent on honoring his old friend's utopian dreams."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_RODRIGUEZ_DESC:0 "The son of a Spanish immigrant to Illinois, William Rodriguez made his living painting houses, until he could eventually afford to pursue a legal degree. Inspired by his brother in law, a radical journalist named J. Louis Engdahl to join the American Socialist party and move to Chicago. The young Rodriguez managed to win a race for the Chicago city council as a dark horse candidate, becoming the first socialist and first Hispanic to sit on the council. He soon managed to use his newfound position to attack the city's transit companies and to seek legal reforms. Although eventually ousted by a democratic and republican unity candidate, Rodriguez did not give up on politics. He continued to practice law and ran a successfully campaign in 1933 to become a judge. Building on a lifetime of legal and political experience, his next triumph came when he ran his most recent successful presidential campaign."
POLITICS_MORRIS_HILQUIT_DESC:0 "One of the oldest political figures in the Combined Syndicates, Hillquit was born in 1869, to a Jewish family living in Latvia. After his father lost his business, the young Morris and his dad crossed the Atlantic in search of a better life. Soon settled in the slums of New York, Hillquit would go on to found the Socialist Party of America alongside Victor Berger and Eugene V Debs. He ran for the senate in 1908 from New York City, garnering 21% of the votes. Despite this failure, he would later unsuccessfully run for mayor of NYC and afterwards help organize fellow socialist Meyer London's successful bid for congress. Despite suffering from numerous bouts of tuberculosis and frequent conflicts with the growing syndicalist wing of the SPA, Hillquit endured long enough to witness the revolution finally sweep through America. Although old and sickly, his seniority and eventful life has netted him a surprising victory in the latest presidential election. His age helped to invalidate dissenters who wanted a natural born citizen as President. Although some remain uncertain if he can finish his current term, President Hillquit has sworn he will serve the interests of all of America's proletariat, no matter his age or health."
POLITICS_EUGENE_DENNIS_DESC:0 "Born under the name Francis Xavier Waldron, and spending his early life as a laborer and IWW member in California, the young Waldron was driven into exile after the Californian Criminal Syndicalist Act nearly saw him imprisoned for revolutionary political activism. Fleeing to the Commune of France and taking up work as minor union politician, he became an important link between the Socialist Party of America and the Third Internationale. In 1935 he returned across the Atlantic, now hiding under the pseudonym "Eugene Dennis", to help organize Jack Reed's campaign in the coming presidential election. His services to Reed were soon rewarded with a series of influential positions within the Combined Syndicates, which served as the stepping stones for his own eventually presidential campaign."
POLITICS_ELMER_ALLISON_DESC:0 "A self-taught radical from Missouri, Elmer Allison was a founding member of both the Socialist Party of America and the IWW. He was a leading figure in the SPA's radical Washington affiliate, spending much of his life either working in the local cedar mills or atop a soapbox in Seattle's streets. A series of raids and near arrests by the Department of Justice saw him go underground, but he remerged as a political figure when he helped lead the brief rebellion known as the Seattle Commune in 1923. During the Commune's existence he met Jack Reed, striking up a friendship with the famed journalist and following him to New York City. There he was a major figure in running Reed's numerous political campaigns and leading the SPA's entry into mainstream politics. Following the revolution, his close comradeship to Reed and his zealous socialist beliefs has made him an obvious candidate for the presidency. A candidacy he has gladly pursued!"
POLITICS_ELIZABETH_NORD_DESC:0 "Elizabeth Nord grew up as the daughter of a family of poor English coal miners, having to spend her early teenage years toiling in a silk factory. Her family departed England a few years shy of the British Revolution, settling across the Atlantic in Rhode Island. In the United States Nord spent another decade as a factory worker during which she used her political finesse and determination to rise through the ranks of her local union, being elected Chairwoman. She became one of the key leaders of the Great Textile Strike of 1934, organizing the walkout of tens of thousands of workers across the country. On the outbreak of the Second civil war, she was a political representative of her union in Washington D.C, but quickly made her way across the frontlines to the Combined Syndicates of America. Repeating the same grueling political maneuvering that put her in charge of the Great Textile Strike, Elizabeth Nord has now risen to lead something far greater than a union or a strike, she has become the new President!"
POLITICS_DAVID_DUBINSKY_DESC:0 "Dubinsky came from the former Russian Empire to America, a Polish Jew who had spent his early life organizing bunds, leading strikes and campaigning for the Bolsheviks. These actions netted him a prison sentence in Siberia, but the young Dubinsky managed to miraculously escape back to western Russia and catch a ship to carry him across the Atlantic. Spending much time working in the factories of New York City, Dubinsky became increasingly alienated from the union bureaucracy around him, starting a long-time personal feud between him and the IWW. He initially saw unions as inherently apolitical platforms that should seek further co-operation with the right wing to uplift all workers despite political beliefs, and that compromises with the federal government and business sector were practically mandatory for a union's success. Dubinsky would change his opinion after witnessing first the Great Depression, then the steady rise of Huey Long and finally the outbreak of the American civil war. Although he never made amends with the "union bureaucrats", Dubinsky ceased to compromise with the right wing and capitalism, taking on more politically extreme views. When the civil war finally ended he had been singing the praises of the new America, and already planted the seeds for a political career. Despite his controversial past, it appears David Dubinsky has now been able to reap what he has sown, rising to the position of President in spite of protests from old nativists who resist the proclamation giving him natural born rights."
POLITICS_JOHN_LEWIS_DESC:0 "The son of Welsh immigrants whom had settled in Iowa, John Lewis grew up in a company town dominated by the coal industry. At the age of 17 he went to work as a minister, becoming more and more embroiled in his hometown’s local politics and the nationwide labor movement. In 1907 he made a failed attempt to run for mayor, and later became a full-time union advocate who travelled across the steel belt. Although he initially bickered with William Z Foster over the merits of syndicalist trade unions compared to his preferred moderate and apolitical unions, the devastation of the Great Depression saw him slowly embrace more radical beliefs. Despite having once been a liberal and a republican, Lewis could not find it in his heart to endorse President Hoover's second term. Increasingly disillusioned with competitive capitalism, Lewis struck up negotiations with the Socialist Party of America and the IWW. When the American Revolution came, he had made up his mind for which side to stand on. Although his reactionary past continued to haunt him, Lewis eventually succeeded in finding a synthesis between radical unionism and his own moderate ideology, being elected as President in the latest election."
POLITICS_LUDWIG_KATTERFELD_DESC:0 "Born in Strasbourg under the German Empire and sent away to live with family in America at just 10 years of age, where he later ran away from home, Ludwig Katterfeld had a harsh and formative upbringing. After escaping his extended family, he took up work as a farmhand in Kansas, spending his teenage years balancing hard labour with honing his impressive oratory skills and sharp intellect. The next two decades were a turbulent time for Katterfeld, seeing him become a professed socialist and move from state to state to launch new political ambitions. After graduating college in 1910 he moved to Chicago and lead his own short-lived socialist party, the "Lyceum Bureau". He became involved with the Socialist Party of Washington and in 1916 launched a failed gubernatorial bid with them. In 1922 he was the provisional secretary of the Socialist Party of America, and later a representative in their behalf to the Third Internationale. It was in Paris he met Jack Reed, whom he accompanied back to America the very next year. In 1923 both men played a key role in the brief, radical Seattle Commune. The events of the commune compelled the bitter and austere Katterfeld to go underground, breaking with Reed's desire to go into mainstream electoral politics. From there on Katterfeld worked as an independent activist, not resurfacing until the Civil War. He did not have a chance to reconnect with Reed until the closing days of the revolution, with the latter on his deathbed. Compelled to honor his old friendship to Reed and armed with a lifetime of revolutionary experience, Katterfeld has launched into the spotlight with a narrow victory in the recent presidential race."
POLITICS_HENNING_BLOMEN_DESC:0 "A son of Massachusetts born in 1910, Henning was too young to experience the horrors of the Weltkrieg, but old enough to face the American Revolution in his prime. Initially an industrial worker in Cambridge, he was one of the few who did not leave his station the moment the first gunshots of the Second Civil War could be heard. A committed pacifist, Henning Blomen instead helped organize the chemical plant he worked at into a cooperative syndicate. His efforts were greatly appreciated by his more radical co-workers, who nominated him as a Massachusetts representative to the Combined Syndicates and helped him cross the front lines to New York City. Soon climbing his way up the political ladder, Henning Blomen has continuously made a name for himself with his unshakable optimism and iron will, running over a dozen major political races in his lifetime, the most recent of which has carried him all the way to the presidency."
POLITICS_JOHN_BERNARD_DESC:0 "Initially a French immigrant, Bernard worked nearly a decade of his life in the iron mines of Minnesota, later enlisting in the army. He served along the Mexican Border during the Mexican Revolution, a year later returning to Minnesota but soon discovering himself to be blacklisted from employment because his trade union activism. Pursuing a career in firefighting, then as a politician, Bernard managed to be elected to the House of Representatives on the ticket of the Farmer-Labor Party in 1936. While in office, he became more and more aligned with Jack Reed's popular front of socialists, and began to campaign for friendlier relations between America and the Commune of France. Distinguishing himself as a diligent proletariat and cunning politician, John Bernard has gone a step further and made a successful run for presidency."
POLITICS_OAKLEY_JOHNSON_DESC:0 "A voracious reader since an early age, Oakley Johnson took up a career within academia, serving as a teacher and later principal at numerous schools in his home state of Minnesota. This lasted until his commitment to radical politics became more publicly known, and he was arrested in the middle of a seminar over having contributed money to the defence fund of arrested IWW members. Undeterred, Johnson moved to New York and became a full time activist in the Socialist Party of America, helping to promote interracial relations and the education of the proletariat. In 1936 he accepted a position of Docent at a university in Paris, spending most of the coming Civil War abroad. In Paris he helped maintain diplomatic relations between the Commune of France and his comrades home in America. Eventually making the trip to the new America, Oakley Johnson has used his diplomatic accomplishments and academic merits to woo the electorate!"
POLITICS_BAYARD_RUSTIN_DESC:0 "Born in Pennsylvania, in the year of 1912, Rustin was raised in a family deeply affiliated with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He was personally acquainted with notables such as W.E.B. DuBois and James Weldon Johnson, developing left leaning beliefs at an early age. This best showed in 1936 when he organized a student strike at Wilberforce University, which he was expelled over. Cast adrift, the young Rustin moved to New York City where he joined the Young People's Socialist League and got to meet Norman Thomas and A. Phillip Randolph. With the outbreak of the civil war, Bayard Rustin became a political organizer and campaigner for the Combined Syndicates championing better race relations, increased desegregation, and the immediate overturning of Jim Crow in the newly liberated southern states. Now, decades after the revolution he has made his daring bid for the presidency despite the fact that Rustin's youth, skin color and known homosexual relationships have for long been targets of slander and ridicule. Although one might expect any one of those three to have stopped him, he has powered through regardless and been elected the first African-American head of state in American history."
POLITICS_DARLINGTON_HOOPES_DESC:0 "Darlington Hoopes came from a notable family of Pennsylvania Quakers, during his time at boarding school he augmented his religious upbringing with an interest in radical socialism, going on to identify as a Christian Socialist. His ideological beliefs soon drew him close to fellow Christian Socialist, Norman Thomas and the rest of the Socialist Party of America. In 1930, Hoopes was elected to the House of Representatives in Pennsylvania, where his most celebrated accomplishment was completely outlawing child labor in his home state. Much like it did to Thomas, the outbreak of the civil war disgusted Hoopes. Although he could not deny its accomplishments in hindsight, his political cause after the war was to champion reconstruction and reconciliation between Americans. This benevolent, reformative platform earned him more and more influence in the new America, allowing him to make a bid for the presidency."
POLITICS_SMEDLY_BUTLER_DESC:0 "Marine, General and Senator Smedley Butler has done the unthinkable, in the revolution's darkest moment he has overthrown the would-be usurpers and traitors in the Centralist clique, and kept the flame of liberty alive. The old general has been an invaluable warrior for the Combined Syndicates, and his latest startling victory has endeared him to the population tenfold. Although Butler has confided to friends and political allies that he is uneasy to now be in the spotlight, he has agreed to taken on the job as the temporarily acting president of the new America until the scars torn open by totalism can once again be healed."

### Reconstruction Focuses ###
CSA_rebuilding_the_country:0 "국가 재건"
CSA_rebuilding_the_country_desc:0 "위대한 미국 혁명은 끝이 났지만, 우리가 이 나라에 내버린 상처는 손을 쓰지 않는 한 계속 곪아 피를 흘릴 것입니다. 우리는 낡은 폐허에서 평등하고 영속적인 미국을 건설하기 위해 서둘러야만 합니다."
CSA_social_revolution:0 "사회 혁명"
CSA_social_revolution_desc:0 "자유의 땅과 용감한 이들의 고향이 무엇이든 간에, 우리는 미국을 부패, 인종주의와 우월주의로부터 해방시키기 위해 노력해야 합니다. 하지만 우선 우리는 이 모든 것의 핵심인 자본주의 체제 자체를 무너뜨려야만 합니다!"
CSA_redistribute_wealth:0 "재산 재분배"
CSA_redistribute_wealth_desc:0 "아무 것도 하지 않고도 수백만 달러를 가지고 있는 자와, 하루 종일 일하면서도 겨우 비참한 삶을 연장하는 수백만의 무산자 계급의 공존을 옹호하는 사회 질서를 우리는 더 이상 용인하지 않을 것입니다. 은행과 자본가 그리고 기업가들의 미소는 이제 끝났습니다."
CSA_homes_for_the_people:0 "인민들에게 집을"
CSA_homes_for_the_people_desc:0 "지주들의 부동산 투기 놀이는 이 국가에 질병처럼 존재했습니다. 이제 우리가 힘 있는 자본가들을 끌어내렸기 때문에, 가난하고 빈곤한 자들이 마침내 빈민가에서 벗어날 수 있을 것입니다."
CSA_emancipation_for_all:0 "모두에게 해방을"
CSA_emancipation_for_all_desc:0 "겨우 피부색을 가지고 허세를 떠는 등 어리석고 헛된 짓거리들이 인민들에게 영향을 주고 있습니다. 어떤 인종이나 신념을 가지건 무산자들은 새로운 미국을 수립하기 위해 싸우고 분투해야 합니다. 또한 충직한 이민자들에게는 해방의 정신에 의거하여 본토인과 같은 시민권을 제공해야 합니다."
CSA_womens_liberation:0 "여성들의 해방"
CSA_womens_liberation_desc:0 "남성들이 전선에서 쓰러져가는 동안, 여성들은 남성들을 대신하여 군수품을 만들고 공장을 운영하며 혁명에 기여하고 있었습니다! 자신들이 가진걸 모두 바친 수많은 여성 파일럿과 간호사 그리고 여성 적위대원들은 말할 것도 없을 겁니다. 그들의 희생과 분투는 이제 절대로 헛되지 않을 것입니다."
CSA_revolutionary_education:0 "혁명 교육"
CSA_revolutionary_education_desc:0 "구 미국의 교육은 수많은 혁명가들을 양성했지만, 본질적으로 그 교육 체제는 계속 반동적이었습니다. 미국 역사에 있어서, 교육은 순종적인 노동자와 악한 자본가 그리고 양심 없는 정치인을 양성했습니다. 그것을 끝낼 시간입니다!"
CSA_reconstruction:0 "재건 작업 착수"
CSA_reconstruction_desc:0 "내전은 우리 국가의 많은 부분을 파괴했습니다. 수많은 농촌들에 진흙과 뼈만이 뒹굴고 있으며, 수많은 도시들은 지금 연기나는 잿더미에 불과합니다. 따라서 우리는 새로운 주택과 기반 시설들을 가능한 한 많이 건설하도록 노력해야 할 것입니다."
CSA_deal_with_feds:0 "연방주의자 처리"
CSA_deal_with_feds_desc:0 "혁명이 시작했을 때부터, 우리 앞에는 재판을 기다리는 많은 정치범들이 쌓여있었습니다. 그리고 전쟁이 끝난 지금, 그들을 심판할 시간이 왔습니다. 우리 지도층 중 일부는 이들을 재건에 참여시킬 수 있다고 생각하지만, 다른 급진적인 동무들은 강력하고 혁명적인 재판을 요구하고 있습니다."
CSA_transformitive_justice:0 "변형의 재판"
CSA_transformitive_justice_desc:0 "비록 우리가 구 미국 엘리트들을 처단했다고 해도, 아직도 우리의 새로운 체제에 반대하는 상당규모의 대중적 운동이 여전히 존재합니다. 우리는 우리가 승리했다고 안심하기 전에 이러한 남아있는 반혁명적 조직을 가라앉히고 우리 사이사이의 마지막 침입자까지 추격해야만 합니다."
CSA_deal_with_firsters:0 "미국 제일주의자 처리"
CSA_deal_with_firsters_desc:0 "휴이 롱을 추종하는 어리석은 반동적인 선동가들과 비인간적인 산업가들 그리고 권위주의적인 장군들은 마침내 재판정에 서게 되었습니다. 비록 휴이 롱은 해외로 도주하였지만, 우리는 그와 협조한 사람들을 모두 사이좋게 처벌할 것입니다."
CSA_destroy_jim_crow:0 "짐 크로를 파괴하라"
CSA_destroy_jim_crow_desc:0 "남부 테러리스트들을 제거하는 것은 단순한 군사적 문제만은 아닙니다. 우리는 편협한 신앙과 인종차별주의 같은 미국에 수백년간 존재하던 역병을 뿌리뽑고 롱에 대한 개인 숭배를 파괴할 것입니다. 우리는 링컨의 유산을 딕시들에게 최종적으로 전파할 것입니다!"
CSA_equality_for_all:0 "모두에게 평등을"
CSA_equality_for_all_desc:0 "자유를 위한 오랜 전쟁이 막바지를 보이고 있습니다. 구시대의 관습과 공포는 이제 사라졌고, 곧 미국에 있던 불의들은 사라지고 오직 씁쓸한 기억과 역사책 속에서나 남게 될 것입니다."
CSA_reconstruction_is_over:0 "재건 작업의 종결"
CSA_reconstruction_is_over_desc:0 "이 국가가 저지른 죄악들은 마침내 씻겨졌습니다. 비록 구 체제를 파괴하기 위한 과정에서 많은 철과 피가 필요하긴 했지만, 우리는 과거의 폐허에서부터 새로운 세상을 일으켜 세웠습니다. 이 땅은 노동자들이 자유롭고 평등하며 번영하게 되었습니다."
CSA_a_new_america:0 "새로운 미국"
CSA_a_new_america_desc:0 "세상에서 게으른 벌을 가지고 국가는 우리밖에 없을 겁니다. 우리는 광범위한 토대를 닦아 놓았으며, 하늘을 향한 돌을 쌓아 올렸습니다. 우리는 노예가 아니라 주인으로써 이 모든 것을 소유했습니다. 노동조합은 우리를 강하게 합니다!"
### American Commonwealth Focuses ###
CSA_second_convention:0 "2차 제헌회의" 
CSA_second_convention_desc:0 "우리의 혁명 투쟁의 다음 단계를 결정할 때가 왔습니다. 단 하나의 대의와 이념 아래 노동자들을 통합할 방법을 찾기 위해서 말입니다. 우리의 대표들이 다수의 노동조합과 공동체에서 왔지만, 우리는 사회주의 정부의 미래에서는 통합되기를 소망합니다. 한 세기 전에 그랬듯이, 우리는 필라델피아에서 헌법 제정 회의를 열 것입니다!" 
CSA_american_commonwealth:0 "미연방"
CSA_american_commonwealth_desc:0 "독재체제로 후퇴할 수는 없습니다. 2차 제헌회의에서의 우리의 헌신적인 지원으로 마침내 노조기반 사회주의를 보여 줄 것입니다. 벨라미의 국민주의를 계승했지만, 우리 국가의 노동자와 노역자에게 사회인 그리고 경제적인 자유를 제공할 것입니다. 이것은 첫 번째 조항에서 다룰 것입니다."
CSA_protect_the_working_class:0 "노동자 계급을 보호하라!"
CSA_protect_the_working_class_desc:0 "많은 더 나은 경제적 체제에 대한 새로운 생각과 이론이 미국에서 존재했지만, 내전의 혼란은 이러한 아이디어를 실현하는 것을 어렵게 했습니다. 그리고 지금 우리는 충분한 시간과 기회를 가졌음으로 헌법에 써진 노동자 권리 보호를 실현하여, 진정으로 일하는 사람들의 민주주의를 만들 수 있을 것입니다."
CSA_empower_councils:0 "마을 민주주의"
CSA_empower_councils_desc:0 "새로운 연방은 권위주의적 방법을 통해 건설되어서는 안 되며. 우리는 더 나은 계급적 특성으로 우리의 민주적인 방식으로 건설되어야 합니다. 법을 통해서 풀뿌리 민주주의와 시의회 참여에 힘을 줄 것입니다. 이제 정치적 결정은 더 이상 단순히 의회에서 속삭임이 아닙니다. 이러한 것은 이제 노동자의 권리가 될 것입니다.!"
CSA_mutal_economic_comitee:0 "직종 노조 위원회"
CSA_mutal_economic_comitee_desc:0 "자본주의 체제를 개혁하는 것은 매우 힘든 과제이며 국가 할당량과 경제 계획만을 통해서 이를 달성 할 수 없습니다. 평의회는 직종별 노동조합의 지역 대표를 소집하여 전문적인 노동자를 보호하며 경제 성장에 적합한 방법을 찾을 것입니다.“
CSA_councilism:0 "평의회주의"
CSA_councilism_desc:0 "미국의 낡은 관료제를 유지하는 것은 좋지 않습니다. 직장 민주주의가 활발하게 성공을 입증하는 중이고 따라서 평의회에 기초된 생디칼리슴 체제를 도입하는 것이 가장 적당할 것입니다.."
CSA_federalism:0 "연방주의"
CSA_federalism_desc:0 "비록 구 미국이 정치적 부패와 게리멘더링 그리고 비효율적 행정 조직의 원산지였지만, 그 행정 체제는 우리 국가의 정체성의 초석이었죠. 우리는 우리 시민들이 가진 주에 대한 애정을 파괴할 수 없습니다. 대신 우리는 주의 오래된 결함을 조정 할 수 있을 것입니다."
CSA_power_to_the_people:0 "인민들에게 권력을!"
CSA_power_to_the_people_desc:0 "아마 우리 역사 초기에는 진정한 민주주의가 번영했을 것입니다. 탐욕스러운 자본가와 부패한 정치인들에 의해 허상이 되어버린 자유가 아닌 진정한 자유 말입니다. 이제 진정한 직접 민주주의적 통치 수단을 통해 새로운 연방을 직접 이끌 수 있게 되었습니다. 우리는 이러한 약속을 헌법 조항에 써 넣어서 영원히 유지할 것입니다."
CSA_federalist_economics:0 "사업 조합주의"
CSA_federalist_economics_desc:0 "많은 노조 연맹의 성직자들은 '사업 노조주의'가 대혁명을 배반한다고 생각합니다. 하지만 그들이 착각하는 것은 미국의 자본주의 역사는 200년이 넘는다는 것입니다. 우리는 사회주의로 이행하기 위한 과도기적 경제 체제가 필요합니다. 그래서 의회의 지시하에 국가의 가격 통제 법안을 통괴시켰습니다."
CSA_mutualism:0 "보호주의 정책"
CSA_mutualism_desc:0 "전문 노동자 평의회는 미국 상품을 보호하기 위한 보호 무역 정책을 펼치기로 결론 내렸습니다. 하지만 이것은 과거 스무트 홀리 관세법 같은 극단적인 관세 정책을 의미하지 않습니다. 단지 국가 내의 조합들에 대한 세금 감면 증대와 미국 국내 제품 판매를 권유하는 프로파간다 첫 번째 세계 대전 때와 비슷한 수준의 부드러운 보호 무역 정책을 실행 할 것입니다.“
CSA_workers_cooperatives:0 "노동자 협동조합"
CSA_workers_cooperatives_desc:0 "산업 노동조합의 지배는 기업들의 종말을 의미하는 것이 아닙니다. 우리는 단순히 불공정한 이익을 추구하는 사업자를 교체할 것을 원할 뿐입니다. 대신에 노동자들이 그들의 작업장내에서 결정을 할 수 있게 하고 거기서 나오는 부를 그들 스스로 공정하게 분배할 것입니다."
CSA_social_dividends:0 "사회적 분배"
CSA_social_dividends_desc:0 "평의회는 기본 소득제 도입하는 법안을 통과시켰습니다. 국영기업에서 나오는 모든 이윤의 일부를 시민들에게 분배 될 것입니다. 우리 노동자들이 단순한 수동적 존재가 아니라 우리 국가의 운영을 주시하는 존재입니다. 그렇기 때문에 그들은 미국의 공공 자산의 일부를 받을 자격이 있습니다."
CSA_public_owned_enterprise:0 "공공 소유 기업"
CSA_public_owned_enterprise_desc:0 "공기업은 오랫동안 미국에서 회피되었던 문제였고, 수많은 미국의 전 대통령들이 그들의 유권자보다 대기업에게 더 큰 관심을 가졌습니다. 그리고 지금 그러한 기업들은 모두 분쇄되었으니. 의회는 공기업을 합법화하고 감독 할 것입니다. 루즈벨트주의와 환경보호활동가들만이 우리의 발목을 잡습니다!"
CSA_american_syndicalism:0 "신 미국 생디칼리슴"
CSA_american_syndicalism_desc:0 "미국은 마침내 착취적인 자본주의를 뒤로 하고 빛나는 미래를 향한 첫 번째 이행기로 들어섰습니다. 비록 평의회에서 몇몇 의원들은 ‘미국적 특색의 생디칼리슴’에 대해 거부하고 있지만, 그들은 산업의 성장과 힘 앞에서는 불평하지 않을 것이며, 우리 인민들은 이러한 거대한 번영을 기뻐하는 중입니다!"
CSA_unionist_economics:0 "산업 조합주의"
CSA_unionist_economics_desc:0 "비록 일부는 미국의 자본주의와 생디칼리슴이 결합된 정책을 옹호하지만, 우리가 구 체제와 타협할 수 없음은 명백합니다. 이제 노동조합들이 우리 경제를 지배하기 위해 일어나야 하며, 조합은 이제 연방정부의 모든 부분에 권한을 가지게 될 것입니다."
CSA_industrial_unionism:0 "생디칼리스트 지배"
CSA_industrial_unionism_desc:0 "시장은 이전에는 공급과 수요, 또는 투자자들의 변덕에 의해 결정되었지만, 우리의 새로운 시스템은 수요 측면 경제성에 의해 만들어질 것입니다. 평의회는 노동자들이 노동 조합을 세계산업노동자연맹에 등록하지 않으면 벌금과 복리후생 손실을 감수해야 한다고 선언했습니다."
CSA_workers_self_managment:0 "노동자 자주 경영"
CSA_workers_self_managment_desc:0 "평의회의 위대한 목표는 미국 직장 안에 스며든 구시대의 계층 구조를 타바하는 것입니다. 그래서 법적으로 간부들과 주주들의 투표권을 불법화 했습니다. 그로 인해 지금 노동조합들은 모든 생산수단을 통제할 수 있게 된 것입니다!"
CSA_industrial_democracy:0 "산업 민주주의"

In Dewey's eyes, the purpose of education should not revolve around the acquisition of a per-determined set of skills, but rather the realization of one's full potential and the ability to use those skills for the greater good. In particular he emphasizes that schooling must include hands-on learning famously stating 'if knowledge comes from the impressions made upon us by natural objects, it is impossible to procure knowledge without the use of objects which impress the mind'. Dewey's detractors, notably the Catholic Workers Movement, claim his polities are antagonistic to religious education. Ultimately [CSA.GetLeader] has decided to endorse Dewey's reforms."

csa.22.d:0 "[CSA.GetLeader] and the Attorney General appeared to Congress today to allege that they uncovered a connection between the corporations that supported Huey Long, MacArthur, and the Pacific States. This accusation alleges that business interests in America were behind the degradation of civil politics during the revolution, and in the event of either MacArthur, the PSA or Long winning, the Corporations would be the true power behind the presidency. The president has proposed the immediate complete dissolution and expropriation to the state of assets belonging to traitors in this grand conspiracy. Congress it taken aback, with most initially supporting this measure. The list of traitors, however, causes concern among certain members of the IWW and AFL. It appears that some of the corporations on the chopping block include large pharmaceutical companies like Merck & Co. Many Congressment worry that punishing the medical profession will harm the life expectancy of the CSA. An alternate proposal for these corporations to be collectivized and their members rehabilitated and let free."

Congress has approved of a roaming documentary to film the new America, so that the world may know our progress. The film was shown to Congress to shock and revulsion, with scenes government propaganda defaced, continued social barring of women from workplaces, and a union representative charging a black worker nearly five times the going rate for union membership. The director, King Vidor, has been advised by colleagues to make himself scarce, as the reaction is not what he intended. Congress has demanded Vidor to release the names of those filmed, so their crimes could be properly prosecuted. A minority of Congressmen came to defend the film, claiming that this shows the systematic difficulty in enforcing such revolutionary acts throughout the nation. These unpopular Congressmen were then ejected from the building."

The Family Code is a revolutionary code that is driven by an ideological desire to wither away the capitalist model of the family to be replaced by a socialist model of the familial free unions based on mutual love and respect.\n\nThus to that end the code included a number of revolutionary changes. It abolishes all impediments to marriage, the biggest one being the abolition of anti-miscegenation laws. Civil marriage is now the only legal type of marriage. The code establishes no-grounds divorce, with both spouses receiving equal division of the property at the time of divorce. Also abolished is the concept of illegitimacy. Now all children are entitled to parental support and equal rights under the law. \n\nFurthermore in accordance with the revolutionary laws regarding the family, adoption of children that were made homeless by the revolution is subsidized. The European concept of Free Love is still under consideration, as well as decriminalizing homosexual behavior. A Committee of Sexology, led by Magnus Hirschfeld, Wilhelm Reich, Harry Hay and Alain Leroy Locke are still locked in debate over how to approach this."

Now this long con has paid off, and a group of trusted Congressmen have smuggled Townsend back into America under the pretense of reconciliation. Townsend was immediately arrested in the first bugged hotel room he stayed in, and has become the main attraction in the largest Union Trial in American history. Townsend's fate was already sealed, but this trial will hopefully discourage any more dissidents within the IWW from thinking any reactionary thoughts."

It has come to his attention a despicable group of infiltrators into the new America in the form of the The International Peace Movement.

These tactics include trying to force wall-to-wall voting on trades where expertise is clearly correlated to competence, allowing new employees to outshout veterans. The tipping point was when a mail bomb was discovered near President Foster's home, which was traced back to the AFL. All other legal means to stop the AFL leaders from despoiling their craft did not work, so the Vanguard is forced to intervene directly. Lewis, among many other AFL traitors was arrested and will stand trial for their crimes against Labor."

IWW는 새 생디칼리슴 정부의 노동실로 임명되었고, 회사 주식의 매각은 불법이라고 선언되었습니다. 그들의 성공에 만족한 대표들은 무장 혁명을 조직하기 위해 시카고로 돌아왔습니다."

csa.152.d:0 "연방의 폭압으로부터 노동자들을 보호하는 것이 목표였던 총파업이 이제 생산수단을 장악하려는 움직임을 보이고 있습니다. 적위대는 월 스트리트를 해체할 뿐만 아니라 연방 준비 은행의 금을 압수하기 위해 맨하탄 하부에 대피령을 내렸습니다. 이 대표단에는 기자들이 있었는데, 그들은 의원들이 시카고에 안전하게 보관하기 위해 안전 상자를 가지고 가는 것을 볼 수 있었습니다. 이들은 노먼 토마스를 차관으로 선출한 IWW의 신임을 받고 있습니다. 몇몇 사회당 정치인들은 워싱턴에서 에클레스 빌딩 밖에서 만나 연방준비제도이사회 의장 유진 블랙에게 청원하던 중 체포되었습니다."

csa.153.d:0 "연방정부가 적시한 30일이라는 기한이 다가옴에 따라 어느 쪽도 자신의 의견을 철회하지 않으리라는 것이 분명해졌습니다. 리드의 지지자들이 점유한 지방에서는 적위대가 대거 늘어났고, 무력을 통해서라도 이 나라를 생디칼리슴 국가로 바꾸자는 의견이 점점 더 대중적으로 받아들여지고 있습니다. 결국에는 연방정부 역시 더 이상 타협의 길을 걷지 않으리란 것이 명확해 졌습니다."
csa.153.a:0 "시간문제일 뿐이다"

csa.154.t:0 "Reconcile with the CSA?"
csa.154.d:0 "Against all odds, [CSA.GetNameDef] has triumphed against all opposition, radically transforming America overnight. From their constitutional convention, a new system has arisen, one centered around the principles of syndicalism and workers' democracy - biased as it may be, it's still democratic at is core, something which surprised many people expecting the revolution to inevitably collapse into tyranny. With the recent election of the Farmer-Labor Party, a furious debate has broken out regarding the possibility of a peaceful reunification. While our government is favourable to many of [CSA.GetNameDef]'s policies, they are also far more radical, and will be negotiating from a position of strength - meaning we will be forced to accept many hard compromises. On the other hand, the [CSA.GetNameDef] has proven its resilience, with both the Federal Government and Huey Long's Union State crushed under their armies. Perhaps we should accept the inevitable and avoid more bloodshed, before the victors turn their eyes towards California."
csa.154.a:0 "Yes, let us end this ruinous war. (Play as the CSA)"
csa.154.b:0 "We are the true America and we shall unite America ourselves!"

csa.155.t:0 "미국이 재통일 되다!"
csa.155.d:0 "The rebel government out west has decided to lay down their arms and rejoin America. The military checkpoints along the Rocky Mountains are being dismantled and people from both sides of the country are crossing over. At long last the country is reunited."
csa.155.a:0 "From Sea to Shining Sea!"

csa.156.t:0 "No Reconciliation"
csa.156.d:0 "With the recent election of the Farmer-Labor Party, many in [Root.GetNameDef] hoped the rebel government to the west would prove amenable to a peaceful end to the conflict that's ravaged America. However it seems that the rebels out west have decided that they shall not reunite with us. In their senate, they have bitterly denounced the Revolutionary Congress as a hollow mockery of democracy, no better than the tyrants in Washington and New Orleans it had replaced. It seems that once again, force of arms will be needed to reunite the shattered pieces of the country."

CSA_MILTON_WOLFF_ARMY_DESC:0 "§Y장군 설명\n§Y출생:§W 1915년 10월 7일, 미합중국 뉴욕 주 브루클린\n§YMilitary Career:§W Milton 'Milt' Wolff, born into a Lithuanian-Hungarian immigrant family and previously an art student, joined the Red Guard as soon as it formed. Despite holding more Vanguardist views, he was accepted into the ranks, and became quite popular amongst his peers for his leadership during the clashes against the AFP militias in late 1936 and early 1937.\n\nOnce Jack Reed announced the Revolution, it became immediately apparent there was a major lack of command staff available to the CSA, and it was in this void that Wolff was promoted to General following a vote held by his peers and colleagues who saw him as a good fit for the role. However, his ability to lead large armies has yet to be put to the test.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Member of the Centralist Faction, aligned mostly with Browder."
CSA_EDWARD_CARTER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§Y장군 설명\n§Y출생:§W 1916년 5월 26일, 미합중국 캘리포니아 주 로스앤젤레스\n§Y군 경력:§W 흑인 아버지와 동인도인 어머니에게서 태어난 에드워드 앨런 카터 주니어는 태어난 지 얼마 지나지 않아 인도로 이사갔습니다. 카터 가족은 1932년 상하이로 다시 이사했지만 그 전에 대영제국이 붕괴하고 바라티야 코뮌이 세워지며 카터는 어린 나이에 사회주의를 접하게 되었습니다. 그는 상하이에서 현지 미국 주둔군에 입대하려 했지만 나이가 어리다는 이유로 거부당했습니다.\n\n미국 내전의 조짐이 보이자 공사관 선박을 몰래 타고 시애틀로 가 지역 적위대에 입단했습니다. 지역 적위대가 혁명을 위해 동쪽으로 가는 동안 카터는 인도에서 봤던 용맹과 혁명의 이야기를 말하며 서서히 병사들 사이에서 유명해졌습니다. 혁명이 시작되자 카터는 장군으로 선출되었고 올리버 로와 함께 얼마 되지 않는 CSA 참모진의 흑인이 되었습니다.\n§Y참고사항:§W- 연방주의자 파벌의 일원입니다."
CSA_GEORGE_H_CANNON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§Y장군 설명\n§Y출생:§W 1915년 11월 5일, 미주리 주 웹스터그로브\n§Y군 경력:§W 조지 햄 캐넌은 1934년 미시간 대학교에 들어가 기계 공학사가 되기 전 컬버 군사학교에 다녔습니다. 이후 해병대에 들어가기 위해 미시간 주 예비역 장교 훈련단 프로그램에 참가했습니다. 프로그램에서 전투 지식을 향상시켰지만 도중에 내전이 발발하면서 교육은 중단되었습니다. 동료 학생들이 노조 적위대에 영입되자 캐넌은 그들을 따라 적위대에 들어가기로 했습니다. 캐넌은 노조 참모들을 채우기 위한 장교 투표에서 미시간 사단의 사령관으로 뽑혔습니다. 후보자를 짧게 둘러본 스메들리 버틀러는 캐넌을 직접 장군으로 승진시키고 해병대 장교로 완벽히 훈련시키려 했습니다."

CSA_JAMES_PATRICK_MURPHY_ARMY_DESC:0 "§Y장군 설명\n§Y출생:§W 1901년 2월 9일, 미합중국 캘리포니아 주 샌프란시스코\n§Y군 경력:§W 제임스 패트릭 머피는 1926년 캘리포니아 주립대학교에서 무선기사 학위를 따고 샌프란시스코로 이주했습니다. 1930년대의 대규모 혼란 속에서 평범한 삶을 보내던 그는 1936년 대선 이후 적위대에 들어갔습니다. 그곳에서 그는 무선에 대한 전문 지식을 살려 캘리포니아의 노동자들과 시카고의 노동자들을 연결했습니다. 이후 이제는 생디칼리스트들의 보루가 된 여러 도시들을 떠돌며 적위대 분견대의 무선망을 강화했습니다. 이 공로로 그는 적위대 장군이 되었습니다. 하지만 많은 CSA 참모들도 이 무선기사가 미국 땅의 수많은 군대를 이끌 수 있는지 의심하고 있습니다."
CSA_JOHN_TISA_ARMY_DESC:0 "§Y장군 설명\n§Y출생:§W 1914년 4월 6일, 미합중국 펜실베이니아 주 필라델피아\n§Y군 경력:§W 존 티사는 쿠바인-이탈리아인 이민자 가정에서 태어났습니다. 공장 노동자로 일하며 남는 시간에는 아마추어 작가일을 하던 티사는 1936년 12월 31일 적위대에 입단했습니다. 그 이후 뉴저지의 생디칼리스트 병사들에게 신뢰를 받으며 투표에서 사령관으로 선출되었습니다. 이후 장군으로 승진했습니다. 좋든 나쁘든 그가 혁명에서 적을 상대로 이점을 보려면 병법을 처음부터 배워야 할 것입니다."
CSA_HERBERT_HOLDRIDGE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W March 6, 1892, in Wyandotte, Michigan, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Herbert Charles Heitke was born in a German immigrant family, and would sign up for West Point in 1913, graduating in 1917 as an infantry second lieutenant. He was first assigned to the Quartermaster Corps of the Army's Reserve in Georgia, reaching the rank of First Lieutenant in 1920 and Captain in 1923. In 1925, while he was still in the Reserve Corps, he transferred to the Cavalry corps and was assigned as Assistant Professor of History and Social Sciences at West Point. In late 1929, he was transferred to the Army's Cavalry School at Fort Riley, and remained in this position until early 1937, earning the promotion to Colonel in 1934. As soon as street violence began escalating, Heitke decided to resign and move back to New York with his family, signing up for the local Red Guard, where his military experience granted him a promotion from Smedley Butler himself. Now a General of the Syndicalist Army, Heitke has become, along with Maurice Rose and Smedley Butler, one of the few military generals of the US Army to join the revolution."
CSA_OLIVER_LAW_ARMY_DESC:0 "§Y장군 설명\n§Y출생:§W 1900년 10월 23일, 미합중국 텍사스 주\n§Y군 경력:§W 올리버 로는 1919년 미 육군에 입대해 멕시코 국경에 주둔한 제24보병연대에서 복무했습니다. 피부색 때문에 어떤 종류의 승진도 할 수 없었던 그는 1925년 군대를 떠나 인디애나 주 블러프턴으로 이주해 잠시 시멘트 공장에서 일했습니다. 그 이후 시카고로 이주해 옐로우 캡 컴퍼니 택시기사로 일했습니다. 대공황이 닥치자 그는 몇 년 동안 실직자가 되었습니다. 그러다가 하역업자가 되어 국제항만노동자노조(International Longshoremen's Association)에 가입했습니다. 1932년에는 예금을 털어 식당을 열었지만 실패해 다시 한 번 실업자가 되었습니다. 이후 국제노동방위대(International Labor Defence)에 가입했습니다. 미국에 내전의 기운이 감돌자 로는 처음 적위대에 지원한 이들 중 하나가 되었습니다. 그의 군사 경력과 리더십 덕분에 동료 병사들은 그를 장교로 선출했습니다. 전국흑인의회(National Negro Congress)의 지원 받은 그는 빠르게 장군이 되었습니다.\n§Y참고사항:§W- 충실한 노조주의자 파벌의 일원으로 베이어드 러스틴, 아사 필립 랜돌프와 가까운 관계라는 소문이 있습니다."
CSA_ROBERT_H_MERRIMAN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 17, 1908, in Eureka, California, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W The son of a lumberjack, Robert Hale Merriman grew up in a poor family hit hard by the Depression. Forced to take odd jobs to continue his education after graduating from high school, he ended up joining the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) branch at the University of Nevada, where he graduated in 1932, marrying his wife Marion, also a student, on their graduation day. After this, he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, to pursue a master's degree in economics. With the Depression's grip worsening in America and fascinated by French and British economic structures, he and Marion moved to Paris for a year to study at the Sorbonne. Returning to California in 1935, he finished his master's degree and was accepted to the University of Chicago's PhD program in 1936, drawn to the growing revolutionary activity in the city.\n\nAs MacArthur's deadline loomed over Reed's conference, Merriman, with his background in the ROTC, began teaching students of all ages the rudimentary military training he had learned half a decade ago. Though he was not a devoted syndicalist, Merriman was outraged by the widespread political repression and authoritarian tenancies demonstrated by the American government in the summer of 1936, and with his warm personality and commanding figure he was elected to lead the University's branch of the Red Militia.\n\nUnlike many of the other young officers voted into command by their peers, Merriman's military training and educated background made him stand out to Smedley Butler, who hand-picked the young man for higher command, and began to nurture what he saw as his strong talent for leadership and command.\n§YImportant Notes:§W-It is unclear where exactly Merriman's political loyalties lie within the greater CSA Party Congress. He has an academic interest in Syndicalist economic policy, but his distaste for authoritarianism has alienated him from the more centralist faction of the Congress lead by Browder."
