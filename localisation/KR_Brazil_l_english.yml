POLITICS_OTAVIO_MANGABEIRA_DESC:0 "Otavio made his politcal debut in 1908 at the contentious politics of the state of Bahia, and his rapid rise in notoriety gave him fame, and some exiles from the state as well. Said notoriety was enough for him to later become a State Representative in 1912. His staunch positions in favour of the late Washington Luis and João Pessoa during the times of civil helped to raise his profile to greater heights, and he was elected president of the State of Bahia in the elections organized there in 1928. Later, as consensus bid for the Brazilian Republican Party, his name was put forward for the position of President of the Republic, and was endorsed by then President João Pessoa. His presidency was very much a return to normalcy at first, but the rise of radical movements especially in the cities, and public order in general, is a rising concern. However, the good pace of economic and political recovery has ensured his popularity remains high, and it is possible that some of this popularity is why João Mangabeira, his brother, became a household name more left wing circles."
POLITICS_GUSTAVO_DODT_DESC:0 "브라질 북동부 세아라 지방 출신인 구스타보 도트 바로소는 브라질에서 가장 영향력 있는 지식인이면서 동시에 브라질 통합주의(인테그랄리즘) 운동의 지도자로 활동하고 있습니다. 그는 나이가 23세가 되던 해에 작가로 공식 석상에서 활동을 시작하였지만 1928년에 알린도 베이가 도스 산토스라는 저명인사가 통합주의의 가치에 대해 열변을 토하는 것을 목도하고는 정치 분야로 진출하게 되었습니다. 바로소는 통합주의를 주제로 한 여러 권의 베스트셀러를 저술하는 등 통합주의를 알리고 그 기치를 실현하는 작업에 헌신하게 됩니다. 한편으로는 유대인에 관한 음모론인 ‘시온 의정서’를 브라질 포르투갈어로 번역하여 자신의 반유대주의적인 견해를 드러내기도 하였으며, 다른 한편으로는 브라질의 민속문화를 연구하고 이를 시조의 형태를 빌려 보존을 꾀하는 등 그 헌신을 인정받아 브라질 문학 아카데미에 가입도 하게 됩니다. 그가 가지고 있는 심오한 민족주의적 관점은 브라질 국내의 생디칼리스트에 대한 증오와 경멸의 형태로 나타나고 있으며 이들이 브라질에 프랑스의 괴뢰국을 설립하려는 스파이라고 믿게 만들었습니다."
POLITICS_GETULIO_VARGAS_BRA_DESC:0 "히우그란지두술에서 태어나고 자란 제툴리오 바르가스는 정치적 수완이 있는 인물입니다. 정치에 진출한 이래로 그는 경험많은 지도자나 약삭빠른 조무사라는 평가를 받곤 했습니다. 13년에 정치에 입문한 바르가스는 27년의 혁명기 때에 이미 고향 지역의 주지사가 되었으며 재임기 동안에는 혁명으로 말미암은 외국의 개입을 막고 리오그란데두술과 연방군 사이의 긴장을 조절하는 등의 정치적 수완을 보였습니다. 내전이 끝나고 바르가스는 주앙 페소아 정부 하에서 부통령이 되었으며 라디오를 비롯한 대중매체를 통해 자신을 어필하면서 전국구적 인사로 이름을 떨치게 됩니다. 오타비오 망가베리아가 정권을 잡은 직후부터 그는 향후 4년동안 대선을 치밀하게 계획하기로 결정하였습니다. 자신이야말로 항상 최우선적으로 브라질을 위한다는 극단적이지는 않으나 강력한 견해를 피력하는 바르가스는 국가가 진정한 근대화를 이루기 위해서는 광범위한 산업화-근대화-재무장 계획을 실천하는 것이 유일한 방법이라고 믿고 있으며 이는 모두 브라질의 미래를 위한 것이기 때문에 어떤 법이나 인사도 이를 막을 권리가 없다고 주장합니다."
POLITICS_EURICO_DUTRA_BRA_DESC:0 "A Matogrossense general with the highest condecorations, Eurico Gaspar Dutra started his military career very early, and went to officer's academies at Rio Pardo, Rio de Janeiro, where he partook in the Vaccine Revolt and was later pardoned, and at Porto Alegre. Respected for his efforts during the Civil War and beyond, the officer has enough gravitas to pull together a haphardly government, which is more or less a dictatorship all but in name, to keep order in this time of extreme crisis. He has a very public disdain of Syndicalism and all forms and socialist and has personally overseen the crushing of several revolts of this nature over the past decade."
POLITICS_JULIO_PRESTES_DESC:0 "A representative of a powerful family in São Paulo, Julio Prestes debuted in the political arena in 1909 as a state representative in the parliament of São Paulo. He quickly distinguished himself, and even led troops into battle against mutinous military men twice before becoming a federal representative, where his liberal character gave him admiration from many. A friend and supporter of Washington Luís, Prestes was devasted by his sudden assassination and rallied behind the cause during the coming crisis and conflict, but was glad that it ended as quickly as it did. He gained renewed political vigour afterwards, and claims to be trying his best to uphold the legacy of his friend Washington. Following the defeat of Bahia's liberals in the previous elections, Julio found himself as an almost unanimous choice for candiate of the Liberal Party, and his victory again renewed his vigour to uphold the liberal and positvist principles he defended throughout his life."

POLITICS_ABILIO_NEQUETE_DESC:0 "An orthodox christian hailing from Lebanon, Abilio de Nequete is actually not his birth name, that being Abdo Nakt. He came to Brazil looking for his father, who had emigrated years earlier than him, in 1903, and reunited with him shortly thereafter. However, soon their political differences put a wedge on their relationships, and later on Abilio converted to Spiritism and joined union circles. Inspired by the revolutions in Europe, he joined the anarchist International Workers Union, but their militant atheism caused him and some other men to split off and form the Maximalist Union, a party that opposed their ideas in more matters than just religion. The Maximalist movement grew and garned much strength in Porto Alegre, but still he faced opposition from anarchist unions, who were still the majority in the city, but his influence grew with time. In recent years, he was influenced by other centralist socialists abroad, and his Maximalist Union was one of the many leftist movements to support the so called Democratic Left. He is well respected by most Syndicalists in Brazil, even if his scathing and combative personality got him kicked out of more than one meeting. To him, Brazil's many issues after a decade of chaos can only be solved by a firm hand and unity among the people, a view shared by many army and navy officers. However, anarchists are still the biggest opponents to him in the political arena."
POLITICS_MINERVINO_OLIVEIRA_DESC:0 "Like many of Brazil's poor, Minervino de Oliveira began to work as a child, and from his earliest years of adulthood he already was an influential union member, and also was an early member of the Brazilian Syndicalist Party and contributed to leftist newspapers. By the time the New Republic arose, he was a natural candidate to enter the political arena, and he entered Rio's city council in 1928. In the next decade, his staunch defence of workers rights and support of strikes garnered him many admirers and even more enemies. In 1936, his support to the Democratic Left front of João Mangabeira was a key turning point in the electoral race, and he became nationally known after the endorsement, Thrusted into his new position by the first congress of trade unions, Mangabeira is the first black president and the first syndicalist to occupy the highest office in the country, and the nation holds its breath to see what will come to pass during the Oliveira government."
POLITICS_MACIEL_BRA_DESC:0 "A true captain of the old guard, Olegário his political career all the way back in 1880, and has not left the game since, even at his advanced age. While some opposition members claim that having a president with ''one foot on the grave'' is dangerous for Brazilian democracy, the three time state president of Minas Gerais' politcal power cannot be denied, even if his body fails him more and more frequently in the past few years, as with any man in his eighties. His long support of Vargas in the Republican Party can be seen as ideological similarities, as both see a united and proactive federal government as vital for a better Brazil, but their alliance is often seen as one of convenience between the most powerful politicians of two powerful states of the Union. While his platform during elections was mostly a repeat of Vargas's 10 years ago, the ''old man president'' doesnt really considers the southerner his sucessor, as he envisions Gustavo Capanema as the one to inherit his political legacy in Brazil as a whole."
POLITICS_BORGES_DE_MEDEIROS_BRA_DESC:0 "Few men alive had as much of an impact in Brazilian politics, and especially in the Rio Grande do Sul state, as Antônio Augusto Borges de Medeiros, known politically by his last two names. Starting his political career in the 1890s, he swiftly rose through the ranks and assumed the position of state president from 1898 to 1908 and from 1913 to 1926, and was at the centre of the innumerable political crises, revolts and intrigues in Rio Grande do Sul during the timeframe, while also steadily rising to national prominence. Considered by many a man of unparalleled charisma and integrity, Borges refused a judicial position early in his life, in 1892, to focus entirely on politics, and has always tried to strike a balance between his ideas for a progressive Brazil and the whirlwind of political forces in his country and state. Having positioned himself very publically in favour of São Paulo in 1927, his views on the integrity of the state's soverignty remain unchanged, as does his disdain for any centralizing overtures by the government in Rio de Janeiro. Now elected president at nearly his eighties, his positivist beliefs are staunchier than ever, after the national-level schsim of the liberal party and a contested electoral race. While establishing a parliamentary majority and governing the large democracy is a challenge, Borges' gravitas and personal charm will no doubt play an important role in keeping the republic on the way to progress" 
POLITICS_PRESTES_MAIA_BRA_DESC:0 "Maia is not a politician by trade, but rather a civil engineer thursted to the position after his success in planning and repairing the infrastructure in São Paulo's most affected areas by the civil war, and his plan to completely remodel that state's streets has made great strides in the last decade, which made him the man of the hour in these elections. His beliefs clashed with other, older politicians and less liberally inclined members of the party, but his urban remodelling and subsequent tenure as Mayor of São Paulo made him well known nation wide, and thus he was picked to lead the splinter liberal ticket. His lack of political experience, especially at the national arena, may make his government quite the eventful affair, as his plans to remodel the country's fiscal and infrastructure systems may very well find stiff resistance in parliament, even with his own party's views. However, the fact that a man that isn't an establishment politician managed to enter the Catete is seen well by most of the populace"
POLITICS_NEREU_RAMOS_DESC:0 "The first president in history to hail from Santa Catarina, a small state in the far south of the country, Nereu de Oliveira Ramos began his political career in the 1910s, and has since managed to find a distinguished position in his own state's politics, but even still isn't one of the long time titans of politics he beat in the elections recently. While previously a member of the Liberal party, Nereu joined the Democratic Left during the last elections at the urging of Mangabeira, as to make sure that the party is not seen as dangerous leftist outsiders, and because his own frustrations at the apparent lack of changes after the crisis in 27. Now a leading figure among social democrats nation wide, Nereu wresteled much influence in the party in the past four years, and seeks a more centrist, albeit certainly still leftist, path for the party to tread through"
POLITICS_CANDIDO_RONDON_HOS_DESC:0 "브라질의 살아있는 전설이라고 일컬어지는 칸디도 런던은 수십년 동안 브라질의 서부를 모험하고 개척한 탐험가이자 동시에 완고한 공화주의자입니다. 당초에는 정치에 일절 관여하지 않고자 했던 런던은 브라질에 통합주의(인테그랄리스트) 정당이 집권하여 군주제의 복원을 획책하는 것은 물론 자신에 대한 체포령을 내린 것에 상당한 충격을 받았습니다. 이제 런던은 무기를 들고 브라질 전역에서 인테그랄리스트의 군주제와 대중주의에 반대하여 일어선 사람들과 함께하고자 합니다. 이 반대자들은 전략적으로 심히 불리한 상황에 처해 있었습니다만, 런던은 탐험을 통해 얻은 지리적 지식과 군 복무 경력을 통해 얻은 경험을 살려 전국의 다른 봉기군들과 함께하여 자신의 혁명을 완수하였습니다. 이제 그는 임시 대통령직을 맡아 브라질 내에 존속하는 군주주의자들의 병폐를 치유하고 법과 질서의 회복을 돕고 있습니다."
POLITICS_MENEGHETTI_BRA_DESC:0 "Born and raised in Porto Alegre, the capital of Rio Grande do Sul, Ildo Meneghetti is a relative newcomer to politics, being more well known in his home city for being several times president of Sport Club Internacional, one of the three major football teams in the city. This by itself is probably the most divisive facet of the relative newcomer, who joined the Liberals due to his disapproval of working with syndicalist and workers movements as closely as the Left Democrats do. An engineer by trade, his late foray into politics was a mayoral position in Porto Alegre in the last years, which he performed well enough to gain immense popularity there as a politician. Still, the leap from Mayor to President is fairly uncommon and a major milestone in Brazil's democratic history. Assembling a legislative majority will seemingly be the major hurdle for his government, as hardline Republicans are likely to refuse to vote for anything put forward by the Liberals; but such are the rules of this new game he chose to get himself involved with."
POLITICS_BARBOSA_MARTINS_BRA_DESC:0 "By and large a newcomer to politics, even if he is from a traditional political family in Mato Grosso, Wilson Barbosa Martins was born in Campo Grande in 1917, and witnessed first hand as a child the upheaval of the worst years of Brazil's republic, as his father joined the effort to oust the federal government during the struggle between São Paulo and the federal government. Since then, he has walked the somewhat typical path of local politicians towards the federal sphere, including being elected a state representative and then a federal one. Such a young man, no matter how successful, would have any under normal circumstances scant chances at being nominated to run for president, however, the split of the Liberal party left the faction with a dire need for leadership and renewed impetus, and Wilson has managed to garner support amongst those who seek change in the party, but did not leave it. After a close election in which he did not gain control of the house, his political situation is tenuous, with many older politicians dismissing him as an inexperienced youngster from a backwater state, a sentiment often shared by the press in Rio de Janeiro. A coalition with the Liberal Republicans, even if something extremely contentious, is perhaps the man's best hope at a stable government, lest he risks having even his most trivial proposals to the house constantly overturned."
POLITICS_RAUL_PILLA_DESC:0 "An influential man with strong ideals, Raul Pilla is often referred to as ''the Pope of Parliamentarism'' in his home state, even if his plans for reform of the federal government have scant chances of success considering the current political climate. Born in 1892 in Porto Alegre, the capital of Rio Grande do Sul, Raul's career in politics stated when he was only 17 years old, and even during this early age, his position against a strong executive power coming from this early stage in his career, as it was one of the banners of one of the many decentralization-friendly groups in that state, and often found himself in the complex disputes between factions in that state. The conflict between São Paulo and the Federal government was one where he naturally sided against the centralizers, whom he saw as violating the rights of states, and alongside his chief ally in his home state, Borges de Medeiros, fully supported the movement in an astonishingly rare moment of political unity in Rio Grande do Sul alongside other parties. Having since positioned himself against the Republican party, whose centralizing overtures in the past few years seem hypocritical at best considering the cause of the war that divided Brazil so recently, he joined Borges de Medeiros's splinter liberal party, as the two men also saw issues with what they perceived as an ineffectual opposition. His election as president is ironic, as he seeks to abolish the office in favour of one of a parliament elected prime minister, but he knows this is not a possibility in the short term, and his control of the house is tenuous at best. For now, the priority of him and the rest of the Republican Liberals is to undo some of the more egregious reforms from previous governments, while defending the rights of individual states."
POLITICS_JANIO_QUADROS_BRA_DESC:0 "Born in Mato Grosso do Sul in 1917, Jânio da Silva Quadros is one of the leading members of the new generation of Social Democrats that grew up and lived through the worst of the Black Monday crisis and its damaging fallout. The volatile years that followed allowed for the relatively young law school teacher to firmly establish himself in the political scene in São Paulo, decrying the corruption and inefficiency that has always plagued the state's government even before independence. His populist, aggressive campaign, that didn't even spare members of his own party, resonated with the people, who gleefully sang along to his slogans of ''Brooming'' the Brazilian politics of the old, the decrepit elites of the times before the war that hang on tightly to power. Despite all his ambitious plans, he still a democrat and constrained by constitutionale limits, but that has not stopped his enemies accusing him of Syndicalism and treason alike."
POLITICS_AFFONSO_CAMARGO_DESC:0 "Although he was born in the town of Guarapuava, Paraná, in 1873, Afonso Alves de Camargo moved to Curitiba later on his life, after he finished his studies in law school, as it was all too common for politicians in Brazil at the time. In the state capital of Paraná, he found himself involved in the local power struggles between centralist and federalist factions, in which he positioned himself against the national government. Shortly after the hostilities of this state civil war ended, in 1894, he formally entered politics as a state representative, and steadily climbed the political ladder; he became state president of Paraná, and later a federal representative and a senator. During this time, he positioned himself in favour of the Brazil Railway Company in the Contestado Affair, which caused a significant dent in the veteran politician's popularity, but did not affect his political power, as his handpicked successor won the elections after his term as State President with relative ease. A state senator at the time of the crisis that engulfed Brazil in 1927, he later returned to state to serve yet again as state president, and became the chief figure among Republicans in the state in recent years. While he isn't in Vargas's inner circle like most senior Republican leaders, his influence and seniority add much credibility to his nomination, even though some claim he's just 'more of the same', and is seen by opposition as just another aging oligarch seeking more power. However, opposition within his own party is a far more credible threat to his administration's political success, as Vargas and his associates still hold immense sway in the party's house membership, and a shaky base there could have negative ramifications for his government."
POLITICS_MANUEL_TOLEDO_BRA_DESC:0 "Perhaps the oldest political actor of great relevance in the nation, Pedro Manuel de Toledo has a long and rich political career that began almost concurrently with the rise of the republic itself. A staunch defender of liberty and the republic, he was involved in numerous revolts and conspiracies against the status quo, and wrote extensively on matters from secret voting to state autonomy. Of these revolts, his role in the large scale uprising in São Paulo is of great importance, as he saw the federal meddling as a direct attack on republican principles. Having somewhat recently ended a term as president of São Paulo, Toledo decided he was ready to become president of the nation now, even while well into his eighties. His age is seen as his main obstacle by the people, but politics is rarely that simple, and his presidential victory did not grant his party full control of the lower house, which might very well be an issue unless he is willing to work with some of the more virulent opposition politicians. A lawyer but chiefly diplomat by trade, he personally opposes any kind of foreign military adventures by Brazil, but intends to respect all existing treaties regardless."
POLITICS_TEIXEIRA_GYZ_DESC:0 "Born and raised in the city of Goyaz, Pedro Ludovico Teixeira completed his studies in Rio de Janeiro before returning to his home, where quickly began a political career, positioning himself against the state oligarchs, the Caiado family. While initially left leaning politically, the failures of the ED and the street violence that even reached his city during the 1936 elections have drifted him towards a more liberal-democratic point of view. While the nomination was a challenge in itself, few perhaps with the exception of the man himself expected an electoral victory for the presidency. His main goal while at the helm of the republic is one that has defined his political career, his long standing desire for a better and more developed Goyaz, even if his ideas on how to reach said goal have changed quite a bit over the years. After decades of what he sees as neglect, he plans to bring great amounts of investment to hinterlands of eastern Brazil, and in doing so will probably draw the ire of Southeastern politicians who expect to be at the top of the pecking order, not to mention the substantial parliamentary issues a party like his inevitably will face while in power."
POLITICS_JOSE_AMERICO_DE_ALMEIDA_BRA_DESC:0 "José Americo de Almeida was born in the small town of Areia, Parahyba, in 1887, and became a public prosecutor in the city of Souza, in that same state, shortly after graduating from law school. He rose quickly, becoming state prosecutor at the age of twenty four. Such a rise is notable and uncommon in the usually long climb politicians have in Brazil. Americo is one of the many more established political figures to join the party, after their cooling of relations with more radical left elements after the 1936 election cycle, and lends to the party his notable experience and gravitas as both a navigator and a talented author. While the victory at the elections may be seen as a surprise, it is in no doubt due to these new connections the party developed with important leaders, perhaps Americo's reputation as unlucky will finally turn around. Now at the helm of the entire nation of Brazil, he finds himself having to face the great challenge of managing the disparate political forces in the nation, a fact especially exacerbated by his relative lack of clout in his home state, where João Pessoa, his rival, is far more influential."
POLITICS_TANCREDO_NEVES_BRA_DESC:0 "Born in 1910 in the city of São João del-Rei, southern Minas Gerais, Tancredo de Almeida Neves started to take an interest in politics as early as age nine, already as a young man opposing the then ruling party of his home state in the crisis that sparked the Interstate War. While he at first tried to volunteer for opposition militias, his remarkably poor aim and physical disposition had him rejected, and he spent the war at home, while having difficulties finding a job during the economic depression that hit the nation. Some years after the war, he joined the Republican party and began the slow climb through it's ranks, becoming a representative at city hall and the state legislature before heading to Rio's parliament. While his loyalties certainly lie with the Republicans, his somewhat moderate stances on key issues gave him a meaningful leg over other candidates, in what was a fairly contested election, even if the wanton violence of 1936 has been long left behind. His stances on economical and social issues are also why he has a relatively stable control of the upper and lower houses, but the ever eventful politics of Brazil may well surprise even the most skilled of politicians."
POLITICS_ASSIS_BRA_DESC:0 "A true old timer of Rio Grande do Sul politics, Joaquim Francisco de Assis Brasil is a well respected politician, backed by his years of experience dealing with both local and national party members. His career started in 1884, still in the waning years of the Empire, and he became an important figure during the Old Republic era, even if at a national level he was often overshadowed by other natives of his state, he performed very important roles, including vital diplomatic missions to Argentina, Mexico, the USA and more. A true gaucho, Joaquim adores the free country life of the plains, even if he is not advised to ride horses anymore due to his advanced age. Still, he always associated the freedom of the gaucho rider with that of the republican freedoms, and even if not a separatist, places a deep value to the traditions of a state. He is also a prolific historical and political writer, even if some of the concepts proposed in his books, like that of an ''voting machine'' to prevent fraud, do seem truly outlandish. While his victory has led to rabid optimism by most party members, he knows that keeping control of the lower house may well be a far more difficult affair than they predict, as the Liberal majority is tenuous at best, and the party remains relatively fractured even after the split."
POLITICS_AFONSO_FEATHER_JUNIOR_BRA_DESC:0 "Born in the small town of Santa Barbara in Minas Gerais, Afonso Augusto Moreira Pena Júnior started his career like many other local politicians, studying law and becoming a state representative. Even though he is a very successful liberal and a respected literary intellectual, he always had to deal with the looming shadow that his father, former President Afonso Pena, whose achievements and legacy always seemed impossible to match. But now, he too has become president of Brazil, but unlike his father, who was frustrated at every turn by powerful landlords and political opponents, Junior is determined to advance and modernize the Brazilian nation to the standard enjoyed by other nations, especially in its farthest reaches, both in terms of education and infrastructure development. However, said endeavours are certainly easier planned than followed through, for even with a relative control over the ever turbulent politics of Brazil, there is no shortage of opposition for the so called radical ideas put forward by Afonso."
POLITICS_JOAO_GOULART_BRA_DESC:0 "João Belchior Marques Goulart, known by the common people by the nickname Jango, hails from a family of powerful landowners in Rio Grande do Sul. While he is a relatively young man, his career in politics saw a rapid rise since it's start in the 1940s, but before that he studied law and notably was a youth player for Internacional in Porto Alegre before entering the political arena, under the auspices of his father, the rather powerful Vicente Goulart. He has always been a bit more left leaning than his father however, and his election may well be the shake-up the left in Brazil needed in this decade, as many of the old slogans and talking points have been rendered moot by changes in legislation. Frequently accused of being a syndicalist or a populist, Jango is steadfast in his moderate stance, defending that all voices are heard, but also vehemently denying claims of syndicalism. This so called ‘softness’ towards what many in Brazil consider dangerous radicals may well cause instability during his rule, as Republican political forces already prepared to thwart his every move in congress. It seems that winning the elections is just the first of many battles head of Jango's presidency."
POLITICS_OSVALDO_ARANHA_BRA_DESC:0 "Osvaldo Euclides de Sousa Aranha hails from the town of Alegrete, in Rio Grande do Sul. Ever since the earliest points of his career, he has been seen as both a reliable mediator and a skilled administrator, skills sorely necessary in a state where political violence was at a breaking point until the state presidency of Getúlio Vargas, a man who is one of his closest allies and friends, and it's a common occurrence to see both side by side. Having spent most of his career as a diplomat after the Civil War, he returned to Brazil and politics at the request of his longtime friend, as a consensus candidate was sorely needed in the ranks of the ever fractured Republican party, even if the party itself is not nearly as divided and decentralized as it was during the early 1930s. His remarkable experience as a mediator is surely to be invaluable as the head of state, and it's widely predicted that his demeanour and relatively moderate stances will ensure one of the most stable and hopefully prosperous presidencies in Brazil's republican history, as his party gives him an extremely comfortable political position at the Catete. His years as a diplomat will also hopefully help with diplomacy abroad, as Brazil looks more than ever outwards in these new times."
POLITICS_JK_BRA_DESC:0 "Hailing from the city of Diamantina in Minas Gerais, Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira is the son of a Mineiro father and a Czech mother, his middle name being the Germanized spelling of Kubícek. After his father's death very early on his life, he began his studies, and eventually graduated from medical school and volunteered to aid in medical service during the Interstate War. Afterwards, he began his by now very long political career. While he is a well known figure in Belo Horizonte, where he even ran for the office of mayor in the past, and has been a representative in Rio multiple times, his clout outside of his home state has always been somewhat limited, even after the victory in the election, as the Liberal party has to juggle with opposition at every corner of congress. However, even with these issues, JK, as he is more commonly known to the public, has big plans. Not just urban renewal, infrastructure investments or political reforms, he is a very vocal proponent of the proposal of moving the capital of the nation further inland to push development in the great hinterlands of the Cerrado plains, which would be an outrageously expensive endeavour. Regretfully for him, and thankfully for the state budget some say, such a proposal is already dead on arrival, with massive opposition from several groups in parliament and prominent newspapers."
POLITICS_LANDRY_SALES_DESC:0 "A native of Acaraú and born in 1904, Landry Sales Gonçalves started his career as a military officer, and both took part on rebellions back in the Old Republic and interacted with several key figures of the tenentist uprisings that would follow. While he did flirt with the AIB during the rise of that party, he since has adopted more classical liberal stances while keeping his militarist political thought, and has been elected president with great support from fellow officers in campaigning. His outlook towards politics also changed over the years, and he is more in favour of de-escalating tensions and a generally less active role of active officers in political affairs. His nomination by the party was somewhat contested, but the true challenge will be to retain control of congress with a significant house minority, especially since there is little chance of the Liberal factions cooperating even this long after their political split, albeit there is nothing a few ministerial positions can’t solve, some say. Regardless, his presidency is probably going to be one of the most difficult affairs in recent memory, but the man is used to both the harsh life of the barracks and the ever shifting loyalties of politics."
POLITICS_ELISA_KAUFFMAN_ABRAMOVICH_BRA_DESC:0 "A career teacher and Ashkenazi jew, Elisa Kauffmann was born in São Paulo during the late stages Weltkrieg, her parents having fled the horrors of wartime Russia. While a teacher, she has worked on special schools to help other jews fleeing Europe in the following decades of chaos and unrest on the continent. Having been a political activist from a very young age, Elisa was one of the few openly socialist politicians to run for office under the ED umbrella and succeed in the contentious 1936 elections, being always a voice for the worker's movement in parliament. Her general political experience put her ahead of the pack in the selection process for chairman, but even still gathering the necessary support was by no means an easy feat, as Brazil's unions are even more decentralized in terms of ideology and state lines than the previous parties once were. Now in power and leading Brazil's nascent socialist government, Elisa has to deal with a tumultuous foreign and internal political landscape, and ensure that the planned industrialization and development programs go on as planned. Thankfully, the worst, more shaky years of the new status quo seems to be the in past, and she seems more than capable of achieving her goals."
POLITICS_ELISA_KAUFFMAN_ABRAMOVICH_BRA_SD_DESC:0 "A career teacher and Ashkenazi jew, Elisa Kauffmann was born in São Paulo during the late stages Weltkrieg, her parents having fled the horrors of wartime Russia. While a teacher, she has worked on special schools to help other jews fleeing Europe in the following decades of chaos and unrest on the continent. Having been a political activist from a very young age, Elisa was one of the few openly socialist politicians to run for office under the ED umbrella and succeed in the contentious 1936 elections, being always a voice for the worker's movement in parliament. Despite the fallout of their coalition's perceived failures, and the many political issues since arisen, she has not faltered in her desire to establish a broad left front to improve the situation in Brazil, even if it means great compromises with the Social Democrats and other traditional political forces in the country. Now known nationwide as the 'Red Senator' after a long tenure maintaining worker's rights at the forefront, she has to assuage military personnel's rampant fear of a syndicalist coup, as her proposals, while seen as overly moderate by her fellow syndicalists, are extremely radical for a nation like Brazil. However, the longstanding dissatisfaction of the common people with the seemingly endless inability of the federal government to end poverty, unemployment and other far more pressing concerns than ideological disagreements have ensured she managed to win a democratic election and become the first female to do so. Now she has to deal not only with the traditionally conservative elites, but with a constantly divided and bickering powerbase in an even less stable legislature; and yet she wholly believed she can turn Brazil's fortunes around for good."
POLITICS_ISIDORO_DIAS_LOPES_DESC:0 "One of the many old and very respected Gaúcho officers in the Brazilian Army, also known for the moniker of 'Marshall of the Revolution' recently, Isidoro Dias Lopes has a long history of siding with what he considers morally correct rather than what his superiors order him to. From 1893 in the Federalist Revolt in his home state to now the Chilean Crisis, his steady hand and respect by the people and officers granted him enough political capital to proclaim himself provisional president. Despite persistent requests by other officers, especially from those further to the right who see his moderate voice as needed, Isidoro has stated in no uncertain terms that his government is temporary, and he will step down as soon as the Union representatives and delegates meet to select a ruler. Time will tell if this decision is the right one for the future of the country."
POLITICS_MARIA_LACERDA_DE_MOURA_DESC:0 "Hailing from inner Minas Gerais and born in 1887, Maria Lacerda de Moura was raised by her anticlerical, spiritist parents in the somewhat larger paulista town of Barbacena, and began her political and social history shortly after becoming a full time teacher, campaigning for nationwide education reform and literacy efforts. She was publishing books as early as 1918 and started to author articles 8 years before that, and during this period she began to be influenced by anarchist and syndicalist thought. Despite issues with suffragette movements, whom she saw as 'not fighting for enough change', she has always been one of the foremost feminist activists in the country, something that no doubt influenced in her choice as Chairwoman by progressive minded delegates, but she also has held a position among the most respected lefitist academics and authours on São Paulo. Now, Brazil' head of state has the daunting task of leading the continuing socialization of the government, rising demands of officers and the ever contentious Congress of Trade Unions, as some still rose issues regarding her birthplace, but her experience and fame seem to indicate she is more than prepared for the task; or so the nation hopes."
POLITICS_ASTROJILDO_PEREIRA_DESC:0 "Astrojildo Pereira Duarte Silva is a native of the town Rio Bonito, near Rio, and was born in 1890, and left his hometown to the far larger Niterói, the state capital of Rio de Janeiro. There he began his studies in earnest, and after coming into contact with the intellectuals there, he decided to abandon said studies to focus solely on subjects he actually cared about, such as literature and politics. He avidly backed Ruy Barbosa, a reformist liberal, against Hermes da Fonseca, a marshall, in the 1910 elections, and the defeat, coupled with the increasingly repressive actions of the federal government, made him utterly skeptical of traditional politics. He was then, in that same year, drawn to anarchism and syndicalism causes, and began his trajectory in the worker's movement in Rio. He worked tirelessly to organize the worker's movement, creating associations and playing a key role organizing the CGT and the FAB into articulate institutions capable of defending the rights of workers, and was one of their key leaders during recent decades. His distrust of traditional politics made dealings with the Democratic Left difficult, and he was often one of the voices opposing 'class appeasement' with the men he saw as nothing but liars. His popularity and influence among anarchists and syndicalist circles made his election to the position of chairman something of a political inevitability, but even still he is more or less a complete unknown to most Brazilians, who apprehensively watched the old order be replaced with the Union of Brazil. Now that conventional politics and its corruption are gone, Astrojildo can finally get working into establishing the country he envisioned, built by workers, for the workers, while keeping the fragile political peace currently in place."
POLITICS_AVELINO_FOSCOLO_DESC:0 "A member of the old guard of the Brazilian left, Avelino Fóscolo was born in 1864 in Sabará, Minas Gerais, still in the days of the Empire. While at his youth he wandered around the country, allegedly even trouping with the circus, by the 1880s he had left his mark in his hometown's press, championing the abolition of slavery and anti-monarchistic views, and by end of the century's first decade, he was already deeply involved with anarchism in the city of Paraopéba, then called Taboleiro Grande, while he worked as a pharmacist. It was during this time he also began writing books, romances usually colored with less than subtle political undertones as was typical of literature of the time. While he later moved to Belo Horizonte permanently, he also frequently visited Rio and lended his support to the strikes and the labour movement in that city, making him one of the chief figures among anarchists nationwide. And old man, with several children and a life nearing its end, the ideologically orthodox Avelino may well find difficult to reconcile his strong principles with the realities of governing a nation as vast as Brazil, especially considering the intense political turmoil it is experiencing, even if the same adherence to ideological precepts allowed his election in the first place."
POLITICS_EVERARDO_DIAS_DESC:0 "Everardo Dias was actually born in the town of Pontevedra in Spain, and came to Brazil while very young in 1887, as his father fled his home country. He started working at age 13 on a major Paulista newspaper, but his studies later turned towards law, as is all to common for Brazilian politicians. A long time anti-clerical and anti-censorship advocate, Everardo was writing about his political thoughts as early as 1902, and has partook in most great strikes and political actions by socialist and anarchist elements in São Paulo in this century, being one of the most recognizable figures of the movement. His long and storied history with the labour movement was doubtlessly a chief factor to see his name put forward by the congress of trade unions as the head of their council, but he also is a conciliatory and non radical figure, always defending differing viewpoints and the right of non socialist opposition do demonstrate and even put forward candidates for certain offices. While some claim this comes from a misguided sense of camaraderie with his fellow freemasons and former political associates in the republican era, the truth is simply his ever staunch defence of free speech, as a system that cannot withstand criticism is not strong enough to do real change in a country as vast and unequal as Brazil."
POLITICS_CANDIDO_PORTINARI_DESC:0 "The son of Italian immigrants, Candido Portinari was born in the small town of Brodowski, in the state of São Paulo. Always having been a prolific artist, he started his career as a helper in the restoration of churches in his hometown, and at just age 16 he moved to Rio to enrol in the national school of arts, where his talent was immediately recognized. Since then, his position as one of the foremost artists of the nation has solidified, but his political career is far more recent, having only in recent times become truly active as an elected union representative. While his political experience is somewhat limited, his talent and intellect made him well known, and as with many other elections, this fame placed him an advantageous position when compared to his fellow candidates. While it's certainly an advantage for a head of state to be such a respected artist, especially on the international level, many raise concerns about having such an inexperienced man as head of state."
POLITICS_DJALMA_MARANHAO_DESC:0 "A relative newcomer to the political scene, Djalma Maranhão has been involved with the worker's movement since the early 1930s in his hometown of Natal, in Rio Grande do Norte, even attempting to run for a mayoral position under the ED umbrella, albeit that endeavour did not succeed. While also a teacher and journalist, his dedication to the political cause has been intensified since the revolution, as real change finally arrived to Brazil. Having gained significant support from his fellow northeastern union representatives, Djalma now prepares to take the helm of Brazil's socialist government, and seeks to turn development efforts to northeast, as he feels previous governments have put the needs of urban, industrial workers ahead of the great many Brazilians who still work on the fields and on small towns across the nation. Such a paradigm shift is popular in non central regions, but naturally less so in Rio, São Paulo and other major urban centers. Time will tell whether these extensive reform programs will be successful or not."
POLITICS_OTTO_ACLIDES_OHLWEILER_DESC:0 "Born and raised in Porto Alegre, Rio do Grande do Sul, Otto Alcides Ohlweiler is perhaps a teacher first, and a politician second, having dedicated most of his life to his career as a chemistry laureate and teacher at the local federal university. Author of multiple books, most of his political life has been dedicated towards left wing causes, which he formally joined in the early 1930s. While he did run for office under the ED umbrella in the 1936 elections, he was ultimately frustrated by the political games of parliament, and was one of the advocates of changing the legislative to its current form in the congress of trade unions. Having always leaned towards a more european ideal of syndicalism, Otto's views fit well with the Internationale's official stances, but much less so with the majority of anarchists and socialists in the congress of trade unions."
POLITICS_JOAO_MANGABEIRA_DESC:0 "João Mangabeira started out as a noteworthy defence attorney in Ilhéus, before turning to politics like his brother, former president Otávio. Early on in his career he was a close and passionate follower of Rui Barbosa, but after his mentor's passing, he carved a career of its own as a federal representative of the state of Bahia. A man with deeply rooted anti-authoritarian principles, he was a vocal supporter of Bahia's role in the civil conflict, and gained notoriety as a result. As his career went by, the continuous and yet seemingly fruitless struggle of Brazil's poor brought him closer to the left, and while he certainly has some socialist views and allies in union and intellectual circles, he certainly is no Syndicalist. His plan for Brazil was to build a broad leftist front to oppose the current status quo, and his success was unexpected, but probably not unpredictable considering the social upheaval following Black Monday and the scandalous repression of labour movements nationwide. Now, he has to juggle the several disparate factions in his left front while keeping the ravenous opposition at bay, and it seems his presidency is certainly going to be as eventful as his brother's."
POLITICS_APOLONIO_DE_CARVALHO_DESC:0 "Apolônio de Carvalho is one of the most notable military servicemen to have joined political life in the left wing, having had a long and distinguished career in the Brazilian military after he left his home in Corumbá to serve. He joined the ranks of the ED around the time of the 1936 elections, urged by fellow officers to act on his desire to bring meaningful change to the nation. One of the most enthusiastic supporters of the counter-coup that brought about the revolution in Brazil, Apolônio certainly is a proactive politician, as he and many other fellow left leaning officers feel that the changes in the structure of the country are being too slow and gradual, and doing so risks both lives and the safety of the future success of the revolution. His political stances also are a lot closer to traditional french ideals than the general heterodoxical ideas of most officers in the army. As a military man, he also believes in a proactive foreign policy to safeguard the interests of the revolution."
POLITICS_JORGE_AMADO_DESC:0 "Jorge Leal Amado de Faria was born in Itabuna, Bahia, in 1912, and began his career as an author as early as age fourteen. He moved on to Rio de Janeiro to conclude his studies of law, and there was influenced by the many left wing intellectuals and the ideas of the revolutions in Europe, whose success seemed to inspire the left wing elites of the country. He later became a journalist, and only truly joined the political arena in the years after the tumultuous 1936 elections. While he officially defines himself as irreligious, he is in practice a practitioner of Candomblé, an african traditional faith that has many practitioners in the state of Bahia, and is well acquainted with most religious leaders in his home region. Now thrust into the position of head of state, many question his relative lack of experience in the political arena when compared to other candidates for the task. While his enthusiastic approach to his new job is certainly for many welcome at a time where revolutionary fervour is cooling down, he may well not be prepared for the great task of ensuring the cooperation of the disparate unions and factions in the nation."
POLITICS_CARLOS_LACERDA_DESC:0 "Carlos Frederico Werneck de Lacerda was born in 1914, the year the weltkrieg started, and his very name is significant to understand him; Carlos comes from Karl Marx, Frederico from Friedrich Engels, as his father was a socialist activist as well who greatly admired the duo; In time, he followed in his father's footsteps, and joined the CGT and became a full time leftist activist as early as 1932, when he put his law degree on the backseat to focus on the political realm entirely. Long involved in the Demoratic Left and before that the CGT, he found himself rapidly rising in the ranks of brazilian syndicalist circles, thanks to his no nonsense attitude and oratory talent; albeit some claim this is due to his father's influence, not his own talent. His faith in syndicalism is unabated by the crises that followed the past decade in the world, and he took an active part in bringing it to his home. Now, he has taken up the great responsibility of leading his new nation, and to finish the fight against the capitalist rot of Brazil for good, and seeks to implement extensive reforms on almost all matters of state. However, his somewhat aggressive demeanour may result in issues both domestically and abroad when it comes to close negotiations."
POLITICS_LUIS_CARLOS_PRESTES_DESC:0 "While he hails from Rio Grande do Sul, Luís Carlos Prestes started his political career in Rio de Janeiro, where he became an officer and partook in Tenentist revolts, especially left wing ones. There, he was also exposed to the new ideals of Syndicalism as espoused in Europe, and formally joined that movement shortly after the New Republic was established in 1927, and even spent some years in France, at the behest of that country's government. This naturally made him suspect to many who assumed him to be a foreign agent, but his charisma and aggressive politics ensured he remained a relevant figure, and now not only did he finally manage to liberate Brazil from capitalism, but was elected as the chairman of the nation. He has widespread, nearly nationwide military support, due to his long standing principles of anti-corruption struggle, but he's also kept in touch with officers and diplomats from his time in France. Said international connections and charisma made him a natural choice for the leader of the newly founded commune, and now he assumes a position at the absolute forefront of the revolutionary vanguard. A somewhat reserved man regarding personal matters, he has never married, once stating that he ''never met the one''. While the worst period of post-revolutionary unrest has come and gone, it's still a tenuous balance that keeps the political authority of the Union together, but Prestes's longstanding military connections afford the nation a great deal of stability in these turbulent times."
POLITICS_PATRICIA_REHDER_GALVAO_DESC:0 "Patrícia Rehder Galvão, sometimes referred to as her pseudonym of Pagu, is one of the youngest and most energetic leaders of the left in Brazil. Born in 1910 to to a german mother and a french father in the town of São João da Boa Vista, she started her forays into both politics and writing at an early age, despite her deeply conservative background, with a small role at a newspaper in 1925, at age 15, and joined modernist and heavily left leaning circles at 18 shortly after finishing school. The nickname of Pagu derives from one of her fellow modernist writers mistakenly assuming her name to be Patríca Goulart, and stuck as a moniker throughout her life since then. Her political activism truly started in the 1930s, as she and other intellectuals felt that all the turmoil of the last decade did little to improve the situation of her fellow Brazilians.  Her former husband was none other than Oswald de Andrade, who also happens to be influential among syndicalist intellectuals, and is nowadays a close political associate of his ex-wife, despite the relatively turbulent divorce they experienced, allegedly due to bouts of jealousy after one of the couple's many visits to the Commune of France, due to their shared views and values for the future of the country as a whole. As if the institution of the Union of Brazil wasn't enough to infuriate conservatives, the election of a divorced, single woman to the position is bound to intensely irritate those who still believe the government to be illegitimate, and Patrícia's short temper for those who believe they can tell her what to do is bound to cause political attrition."
POLITICS_OSWALD_DE_ANDRADE_DESC:0 "A paulista born in the capital of that state in 1890, José Oswald de Sousa de Andrade has always been an intellectual first and a politician second, but his influence on leftist circles across Brazil cannot be understated. His role in the modernist is quite extensive, with some coming as far as calling him it's founder and main proponent. While he used to be married to Patricia Rehder Galvão, who is more known by her nickname Pagu, the marriage broke down in less than half a decade, as did his previous marriage to another renowned artist, Tarsila do Amaral. While he is known for generally humoured and spirited demeanour, he also is described as combative and often aggressive in arguments, which may explain his relationship's short duration. Still, his charisma carried him with relative ease to a victory in swaying the congress of trade unions to choose him as the leader of the revolution, a task he plans to take on very seriously. While his literary and artistic identity is well defined, few can guess what kind of leader he will be on the international arena, and the nation now pays close attention whether he will make friends or enemies when meeting with foreign diplomats."
POLITICS_PEDRO_VENTURA_POMAR_DESC:0 "Pedro Ventura Felipe de Araújo Pomar lived certainly an unorthodox childhood, having moved to New York from his home state of Pará while aged 5, living there for two years before returning to his small birth town of Obidos, and then moving to the state capital of Belem. He started to act politically at age thirteen, supporting the rebel cause in the interstate war quite publicly, but later on he moved further and further left as he reached adulthood, becoming a full blown socialist by age 20; he spent these youth years studying for medical school, and as a part time footballer for Clube do Remo. A calm and collected man, Pedro often remains quiet in political gatherings, only occasionally inferring in rare points, and has a usually positive and likeable demeanour, which resulted in his relative popularity among trade union members, despite his somewhat young age. Having taken the lead of the entirety of Brazil is one thing, but properly leading the extremely disparate and decentralized factions is another matter entirely. While he calmly believes matters will be sorted shortly and that the revolutionary process will continue smoothly, many wonder if his relative lack of contacts in upper syndicalist circles in major centres of the south may leave him isolated in his own cabinet."
POLITICS_LILLIA_RIPOLL_DESC:0 "Born in a small town in Rio Grande do Sul in 1905, Lila Ripoll began her public life as studying and performing music in Porto Alegre, but she also was a poet before she entered politics, a sudden change she and few around her could have predicted. Such a sudden change came when her cousin Waldemar Ripoll was assassinated in 1936, allegedly on the orders of one of the major local strongmen, Flores da Cunha. This strengthened her resolve, and compelled her to join the unions in their strikes. Her determination to make a positive impact, constant and active political presence, and rising renown among the Unions of Brazil, who see her and her story as a symbol of worker's struggle, and of merit and competency, made her a natural choice to run for the post of chairwoman by the unions of Rio Grande do Sul, and their pitch has been welcomed by the Congress, who named Lila their leader. Now, she hopes to make a positive impact in the country, but her idealism may clash with the tough choices ahead, and the world in conflict around her."

POLITICS_EUGENIA_ALVARO_MOREYRA_DESC:0 "Eugênia Álvaro Moreyra was born in Juiz de Fora, in the state of Minas Gerais, in 1898. After the early death of her father, she and her mother moved to Rio de Janeiro, where she was self taught in proper Portuguese and French. Shortly after her first job at age 15, she joined the A Rua newspaper as a reporter, a fact so unprecedented a brand new work was coined for a female reporter, reportisa. She was one of the key figures in the suffragette movement, and she also became the first major female political figure in leftist and modernist circles, and in these same circles she met her future husband, the poet Álvaro Moreyra, whom she married in 1914. Having been among the earliest members of the PSB and the ED alongside her closest associates like Oswald de Andrade and Carlos Lacerda, she has a longstanding influence on the going's on of the left wing in capital of Rio, and therefore the entire nation, for decades, and this influence has made her one of the key figures of the new Union of Brazil. Her aggressive activism towards gender equality has some less enthusiastic revolutionaries worried about the pace of the changes imposed on the generally conservatvie Brazilian public, she nevertheless remains undeterred and in her dedication to the cause that has taken most of her life by now."
POLITICS_RACHEL_DE_QUEIROZ_DESC:0 "Perhaps better known for her activities as an author, journalist, teacher and translator, Rachel de Queiroz mostly represents the interests of her unions than that of any established political movement in the modern post revolutionary landscape, as she never had a very deep connection with leftist cliques. Often bothered by what she considers ideological orthodoxy standing in the way of eradicating poverty, especially in her home state of Ceará, she was something of a consensus candidate among the several disparate groups that have arisen in the congress, with the backing of several northeastern delegates behind her. This position also may complicate her situation in executive matters, but she believes that working with a focus on the education of the lower orders will bring about greater prosperity than simple industrialization programs, or building huge railways across the nation."
POLITICS_ARMANDA_ALVARO_ALBERTO_DESC:0 "Few women have worked for the feminist and educational causes as long, and as strongly, as Armanda Álvaro Alberto. A founding member of the Brazilian Femine Union, she also was a pioneer in establishing the Proletarian School model, where poor children were granted both food and education from the school, but also she had great influence from foreign innovations in education, especially from Montessori's New School method. She has always defended a position where women of all categories must join to fight for their rights, but also against divisive rhetoric that paints men as an enemy of women, which she saw as shallow and petty. Her position at the forefront of socialist movements has landed her more than one tenure in jail, but also great fame and acclaim in political circles. Her main goals are to combat hunger and the shoddy state of education in the entirety of Brazil, spreading a standardized method of teaching to schools all across the nation."
POLITICS_MAURICO_GRABOIS_DESC:0 "Maurício Grabois, born in Salvador da Bahia in 1912, is descended from bessarabian Jews that fled the ever growing chaos of the Russian Empire during the Russo-Japenese war to find a new life in Brazil, after a long journey. While studying at military school, he started to lean towards radical leftism, while also becoming a staunch opposition of the ever growing integralist ideology that seemed to spread into barracks across the country then. While just 24 years old, he already was leading syndical and socialist activities, and his early rise only went further within the labour cause."
POLITICS_PEDRO_IV_BRA_DESC:0 "Born in exile in 1909, His Imperial Highness Pedro de Alcântara Henrique Astolfo Filipe Maria Gastão Miguel Gabriel Rafael Gonzaga de Orléans e Bragança e Bourbon is the grandson of Princess Isabel, heir of Pedro II, the greatest and last emperor of Brazil. Having spent his childhood at Castle D'eu with the Imperial family in exile, he wasnt able to set foot in Brazil until the Decree of Banishment by the republic was revoked in the 1920s, even though he was deferred from serving in the armed forces in 1925. Having come to live permanently in Brazil after the civil war, which convinced him personally more than ever that a monarchy was needed by the people, he immediately started to articulate politically towards his restoration, and his scheme has finally come to fruition as he has been crowned Pedro III of Brazil. He has been prepared all his life, from childhood tutors to lessons as an adult, for this station he considers his birthright, but few things could prepare a man for the tumultuous times since Black Monday shattered the economic order of the world. While he certainly is thankful for the assistance of the Integralist movement in restoring him, his views towards the more radical wings of the party are not as positive as one could think, as their extreme views often clash with his milder ones."
POLITICS_GUSTAVO_CAPANEMA_DESC:0 "Born in the small town of Pitangui, Minas Gerais, Gustavo Capanema Filho is great-grandson of Guilherme Schüch, the Baron of Capanema. Like most men in influential families, Gustavo studied law in university, becoming a city councillor in Pitangui shortly after his graduation. He has climbed the ranks in the PR very quickly, and while he is a capable man, this is in no small part due to the immense influence wielded by his close friend and associate Getúlio Vargas, as he is one of the few that has the gaucho's trust. His nomination and election campaign had Vargas's widespread support, as cartoonists often drew Capanema as little more than his sockpuppet. But despite these attacks, he remains a staunch ally to Vargas, who now leads his political articulation in congress to ready for a smooth republican government. While many rejoice the stability of the orderly elections, some worry that the oligarchs of the plantations of the old republic have been replaced with a new type of politician, far more cunning and malleable. Capanema, of course, knows these to be only the rumblings of a defeated and scattered opposition, as the many newspapers under republican control will surely begin sharing in the coming months. His politics of self strengthening and industrialization have much in common with Vargas's, as well."

Was closely involved with the coup that toppled the monarchy despite his low rank at the time. In the years since, he has spent much of his time and effort mapping and exploring the far wilderness of northwestern Brazil and its immense jungles, and the specially dangerous task of establishing telegraph lines in that area. A fervent believer of positivist principles, he seeks strictly peaceful contact with the natives of inner Brazil, even at risk of harm; he narrowly escaped death by a poisoned arrow in 1913 but ordered his men not to fire back. His expeditions are each a dangerous and long adventure, with some, like the one he led to the River of Doubt alongside Theodore Roosevelt, internationally known. But he also does not hesitate to lead troops in defense of the republic, and has led troops on occasion against various revolts when he is not expedition, and has an extensive military record in dealing with such. His much higher rank in the military and age have thus far done little to diminish his adventurous spirit, as there is still much to explore the in the far wilds \n§YImportant Notes:§W He has spent great time and effort advocating for the rights of natives to the government in Rio, but his requests, so far, fell on deaf ears. \nHis men claim he has killed an alligator in an expedition armed only with a knife."

Later became a military engineer, working throughout his home state on barracks and fortifications, but was also an advocate of military railways in the region. He joined politics after the republic was proclaimed, but was still first and foremost an army man, with military concerns always on his mind. In 1910 was named Minister of War in the Hermes da Fonseca administration, and juggled several high ranking positions in the republic ever since, reaching the rank of marshall just before the 1927 revolution. While his high ranking means he has with great frequency dealt with rebels, he generally grants them amnesty when they are fellow soldiers, such as in the common tenentist uprisings, but the harshness of the operation led by him the Contestado revolt in 1915 is still infamous. While generally out of politics, and public life in general for that matter, since the civil war, he's still one of the highest ranking and most respected servicemen in the country, and thus well positioned to take leadership in case of war."

Between 1893 and 1895, he took part in a local revolt in Rio Grande do Sul, known as the Federalist Revolution, wherein he was defeated by government forces and exiled in Paris for a year before receiving amnesty. In 1926, he returned from Rio, where he was stationed, to Rio Grande do Sul, allegedly to deal with personal matters, but rising tensions in the capital clearly indicate it was to prepare for the inevitable conflict brewing. During the hostilities in 1927, Isidoro was in general command of the forces in the uprising, and thus is well known as the 'Marshall of the Revolution' for his leadership on the matter. Since then, his prestige has far surpassed those of other military leaders from the conflict, but he mostly keeps away from political affairs, albeit his disdain for the Old Republic is well known and vocal. He has been nonetheless invited to campaign for the Democratic Left, an offer which he refused, despite the fact his popularity is such that he may well be a viable presidential candidate. \n§YImportant Notes:§W His previous exile in Paris left an impression of him, especially regarding how backwards Brazil is to him."

While not fully supporting the Federal Government’s cause, he did not side with the Paulista alliance either. His command in Rio had him frequently square off against strikes and barracks uprisings of syndicalist nature, giving him an immense distaste for the ideology that caused this chaos, and he seldom hid his immense disregard for their movement, especially after they took over Chile and caused open war in Argentina. He is a leading figure among conservative officers,but has shown little interest in Integralist movements or ideology due to his more traditional conservative leanings, despite them sharing positions in violent opposition to Syndicalism. He is also personally opposed to any involvement of Brazil in European or overseas entanglements in general, preferring a generally neutral foreign policy for the nation \n§YImportant Notes:§W Eurico has a speech impediment, and always swaps the sounds for the letters C and X."

He joined the side of the paulista faction in the 1927 revolution, as he was serving in São Paulo at the time and his home state sided with the rebels, and in that conflict he served with distinction as an officer; the conflict, while short, helped him prove his mettle to his superiors and made him well regarded throughout the armed forces after the conflict, as he is now one of Brazil's most valued officers, even if he does not share the popularity among civilians some of his compatriots do. He cares little for such matters, and has not expressed himself politically in any strong way so far, which also sets him apart from several other officers in the army."

There he found himself involved in local politics, joined the Federalist Revolution in 1893 and thus was banished from the army. After a brief period living as a civilian in Porto Alegre, he received amnesty and re-joined the military, and was assigned to an infantry regiment in his home city, where he also collaborated to local newspapers. He was deployed to several states over his military career, generally dealing with local revolts, and even the navy mutiny of 1910. He frequently found himself serving under Candido Rondon, and is among many who greatly admire him in the brass of the armed forces. He positioned himself strongly on the side of the so called rebel forces during the hostilities of 1926, and under his command were made some of the first organization attempts at an air force, even if still under the command of his regiment. Since the war, he also played roles in the ministry of war."

One of his first assignments was to restore order in the south, fighting the so-called Contestado War, under the command of Setembrino de Carvalho, the suppression of which was as ruthless as it was successful. Was transferred to Rio again after the conflict, and during the revolution, was one of the officers who sided with the legalists, and he was briefly arrested as one of their senior commanders, but received amnesty and reinstated a year later. Since then, he was assigned to relatively unprestigious positions, but is unlikely to lead any revolts due to his legalist stances. \n§YImportant Notes:§W Was trained as both an infantry and cavalry officer."

Served under Candido Rondon expanding telegraph lines in the Amazon between 1909 and 1910. Continued to climb military ranks thereafter, including becoming an instructor at the Realengo Military Academy. Joined the side of the rebels in the 1927 revolution, he performed mainly roles related to military engineering and management, and due to the brief nature of the conflict, didn't do anything of particularly great note on that front. Still, he was one of the senior figures in the new military cabinets, and his voice is still one greatly respected among both the brass and politicians."
BRA_HORTA_BARBOSA_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W May 8, 1881, in Pinheiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n§YMilitary Career:§W Joined the army in 1897, and in that very same year fought in the so called Canudos War against the fanatics led by Antonio Conselheiro, where he was wounded. Later studied to become an officer at several schools in Rio, and during his time he partook in the anti-vaccine revolt that brought chaos to the city in  1904. He was discharged and arrested, receiving amnesty and freedom a year later. In 1906, he joined Candido Rondon and Theodore Roosvelt in the extremely dangerous expedition to the then called River of Doubt, being one of the men that made it back. Afterwards, he was one of the officers who studied foreign armed forces after the Weltkrieg, having done small missions to Germany, the United States and Britain before its fall to Syndicalism. Positioned himself as a legalist in the 1927 revolution, but he yet again received amnesty as his expertise is respected among his fellow officers. Politically, he is a die-hard positivist and has been since his formative years."
BRA_EUCLIDES_FIGUEIREDO_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 12, 1883, in Rio de Janeiro, Federal District, Brazil\n§YMilitary Career:§W The son of a Paraguayan War veteran, he was raised by his sister in his early years before joining military in 1893, studying to become an officer. He, alongside most students of the Praia Vermelha military school, revolted against the implementation of mandatory vaccination in Rio in 1904; the rebellion was crushed and the rebels arrested, with amnesty being granted a year later. After studying physics and mathematics, he, alongside other senior officers, was sent to a military mission to Germany in 1911, where he was stationed alongside prussian cavalry officers in Ohlau. After returning, he, alongside fellow officers in the mission to Germany established the Defesa Nacional magazine, which defended several modernization and reform measures for the armed forces based on the German Empire, which earned him and his associated the derogatory nickname of 'Young Turks', no doubt due to the high degree of francophillia amongst fellow officers and other members of the press. After his return, he led forces in several engagements, such as the Contestado war, the 1927 revolution, and against entrenched rebels in Rio and São Paulo in the following decade. As one of the defeated loyalists of 1927, he received amnesty and rejoined the armed forces, but was deeply disappointed in the small extent of the reforms in the military since."

After that, he became an army officer, partaking chiefly in the quelling of revolts in Minas Gerais and São Paulo until the 1927 revolution began, which thrust him into major military operations. The war allowed him to prove his worth, but due to his relatively young age, he still isn't one of the major figures in the army by any means. A staunch nationalist, he has often found himself at odds with internationalists."
BRA_GOIS_MONTEIRO_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W December 12, 1889, in São Luís do Quitunde, Alagoas, Brazil\n§YMilitary Career:§W A member of a prestigious and powerful family from Alagoas, to the point four of his brothers are well known officers and politicians locally. He studied in a military school in Porto Alegre, and while he was very far from home, he learned much about the inner workings of the military, and made powerful friends in the South and later in Rio. While he was a consistent legalist throughout most of his career, he, like many northeastern officers, in the end sided with the rebels, which included his southern associates. Since then his family's influence in Alagoas only grew, and he has acted politically against leftist officers intensely.  \n§YImportant Notes:§W Close political associate of Getúlio Vargas."
BRA_JOSE_CASTRO_LEITE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W October 5, 1871, in Cruz Alta, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil\n§YMilitary Career:§W Having joined the army at a young age in 1887, José studied to become an artillery officer in his early career. He partook in the local revolt known as the Federalist Revolution in Rio Grande do Sul in the 1890s, fighting against the rebels with loyalist forces, and also against monarchist and peasant uprisings later on in a national scale. By the time of the weltkrieg, he partook in a foreign mission to study more modern military equipment, serving as an observer for the neutral nation in the conflict. As one of the main military experts on modern warfare in Brazil, he was a previous minister of war, and his expertise was put to use in the 1927 revolution and the battles in it, as he sides with his home state and the allies over the federal government. Since then, he mostly concerns himself with modernization of the army against more reactionary cliques of officers, as the political situation seems to have greatly stabilized."

His reputation as a harsh, one armed enforced of the old order still persists almost a decade before the revolution, and the war in the Contestado, concurrent with the early weltkrieg, where his extreme methods have been judged nearly criminal. However, they were effective in finally stamping out the revolt in the eyes of the republic. His legalist stance persisted in 1927, if he later abandoned the side of the federal government at the request of fellow northeastern officers, but at that point the outcome of the conflict was inevitable, He has fairly traditional political views for an army officer in Brazil, albeit it can be argued his disdain for integralism and syndicalism is more to their association with sedition and disorder than any deep ideological opposition. \n§YImportant Notes:§W Lost his arm in a dynamite mail-bomb attack in the first years of the century, while he served briefly as a federal representative."
BRA_ESTILAC_LEAL_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W October 6, 1893, in Rio de Janeiro, Federal District, Brazil\n§YMilitary Career:§W Enrolled in a military school in 1905, and joined it in 1912. The young officer was from the outset involved in various revolts against the old republic, and was one of the many among this newer crop of officers to defect and mutiny against the federal government in 1927. This background made his anti-authoritarian stances harden, and to some he is even considered a radical officer, as he is one of the few who agree with the mostly opposition held view that Brazil's new repulic needs still further massive changes and reforms to become a truly democratic nation. He has relatively close links with several other officers who are considered radical, but he is also a staunch nationalist even while strongly anti-authoritarian."
BRA_BERTOLDO_KILINGER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W January 1, 1884, in Rio Grande, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil\n§YMilitary Career:§W Joined the Rio Pardo Military School in 1899, and completed military studies in Rio. Partook in the so-called 'Vaccine Revolt' in 1904 against mandatory vaccination of the people of Rio, and was arrested and spent a year in prison for the uprising. In 1910, Bertoldo was selected to be one of the key members in a military mission to Germany, and he stayed there until 1913, learning much about modern warfare, or at least the latest at the time, as he was stationed mostly with the 24th Artillery Regiment in Gustrow. After he returned, he and some fellow minded officers, like Euclides Figueiredo, started to publish magazines to publicly defend german-inspired modernization of the army and country, which led to the group being mockingly referred to as the ''Young Turks'' at the time. Their anti-status quo position naturally put them closer to the rebels in the 1927 revolution, but the extent of the reforms greatly disappointed Bertoldo, who still sees the military as woefully behind Germany and other world powers. He has since maintained his pro german views and his publications on military matters, and has a strong anti-syndicalist stance as well."

Living in a situation of quasi-exile until the civil war, he later became a extremely influential leader of the far left, constantly pushing politically for worker's legislation and such left wings causes, and partook in some tenentist revolts in his youth years, often at great cost to his prospective career as an officer. However, he is seen with immense distrust by right wing civilians and military alike due to his close links to the Internationale, including a recent trip to France and Britain. \n§YImportant Notes:§W Sometimes known by the rather lofty nickname of 'Knight of Hope' for his constant struggle in favour of the poor."
BRA_ARAKEN_OLIVEIRA_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W October 8, 1909, in Rio de Janeiro, Federal District, Brazil\n§YMilitary Career:§W Perhaps the youngest figure of note in the interstate war, he joined the army in 1927, and one year later started his formal military education at Realengo. Still a relatively young artillery officer, his rise through the ranks has been quite rapid for the relatively meritocracy-averse Brazilian military, no doubt due to the instability in recent years. His age is also why he carries no significant baggage regarding his allegiances in the 1927 revolution, as he was but an aspiring student officer. As with most officers, he leans towards the political right wing."
BRA_MOURAO_FILHO_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W May 9, 1900, in Diamantina, Minas Gerais, Brazil\n§YMilitary Career:§W Finished military studies at the Realengo academy at Rio in 1921.  Was stationed in Santa Catarina during hostilities in 1927, and reached the rank of captain shortly thereafter. He was deeply disillusioned by the lack of immediate change, leading him to later join the integralist movement, having lent public support to some it's more radical figures. Has extensively written against 'liberal-democracy' and marxism alike, and has openly supported and advised in the establishment of integralist militias. A deeply religious and conservative man."
BRA_NELSON_MELLO_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W August 20, 1899, in Santana do Livramento, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil\n§YMilitary Career:§W Joined the army relatively early, and studied in the prestigious military school of Realengo, in Rio de Janeiro. Reached the rank of Captain during the war in 1927, having conspired in favour of the rebels while in Rio before joining their ranks proper, but still too young to be considered a top figure among military circles, especially among the army. Politically conservative and anti-socialist, he has personally led crackdowns against leftist uprisings in Rio de Janeiro more than three times since 1927."
BRA_MARCONDES_SALGADO_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W July 1, 1890, in Pindamonhangaba, São Paulo, Brazil\n§YMilitary Career:§W A member of a distinguished military family dating back to the days of independence, and one of his ancestors was reportedly one of Pedro I's companions at the moment of independence. Júlio joined the army as a cavalry soldier at age 16, and by 1912 had already reached the rank of sergeant, rank of captain by 1924, and after the conflict in 1927 had been named general. A profoundly legalist man, Júlio distinguished himself fighting against insurrections throughout his career, taking barricaded positions by storm in a revolt in Rio in 1923, and had a key role in leading the forces of the State of São Paulo during the war in 1927, where he again performed competently leading local forces, this time against the federal government. He delivered rousing speeches on how São Paulo was not revolting, but upholding republican values that were supposed to maintain the unity of Brazil, and quickly rose to be one of the most famous military men of the entire nation. He is extremely respected especially in São Paulo and among legalist circles in Brazil. While a cavalry officer by career, he is a flexible and modern commander when compared to most of his peers. \n§YImportant Notes:§W An avid sportsman, Júlio is state champion of Polo and Fencing, and an expert horse rider, winning a national title in 1928."

BRA_election_year_desc:0 "아마도 브라질 역사상 가장 폭력적이고 논쟁이 많은 선거를 준비하면서 긴장감이 고조되고 있습니다. 정치적 대화는 열띤 논쟁과 거의 동의어이며 이념적 극단주의의 분위기가 국가의 대중을 둘러싸고 나타나고 있습니다."
BRA_decentralization_desc:0 "브라질 연방 공화국은 자국의 자치권을 항상 소중히 여겨왔습니다. 각자가 자신의 대통령, 자신의 정당, 그리고 자신의 군대를 가지고 있으며, 국민들은 이러한 지역 권리를 위해 기꺼이 죽을 각오가 되어 있습니다. 그러나, 이것은 매우 약하고 이빨 빠진 중앙 정부로 귀결되는데, 이것은 필요할 때 결단력 있게 행동하게 할 수 없습니다."	
BRA_wake_of_civil_war_desc:0 "내전만큼 회복에 오래 걸리는 상처는 거의 없습니다. 미나스 제라이스의 군대가 상파울루에 침입한 후 정치적 과두 정부와 지역 정체성 사이의 긴장이 마침내 전쟁터로 쏟아져 나감에 따라, 전쟁은 수천 명의 사망자와 더 많은 고아와 노숙자를 남겼습니다. 중앙 정부가 하려고 하는 어떤 행동들은 현재 엄청난 불신으로 보여지고 있고, 리우와 상파울루 사이의 국경에 야기된 완전한 피해는 아직 완전히 복구되지 않았습니다."
BRA_fatherland_volunteers_desc:0 "위대한 역사에서 우리 군대의 유산을 기리는, 조국 자원병들은 공통된 브라질 사람들로부터 길러진 힘 그 이상이며, 이들은 국가를 위해 기꺼이 죽을 그들의 의지와 자유를 상징합니다."
BRA_forager_idea_desc:0 "브라질에 군대를 보급하는 물류 병참은, 우리 군인들의 자율성을 요구하기에, 우리 군대는 가능한 한 많은 자원을 쓸 수 있는 능력을 가져야 합니다."
BRA_planningspeed_desc:0 "우리의 장교들은 함께 작전을 계획할 수 있고, 어떤 경우에든 그 계획을 적용할 수 있습니다; 결론적으로, 전투 계획은 적과의 교전에서 뜻대로 되지는 않습니다."
BRA_we_werent_expecting_special_forces_desc:0 "브라질의 특수부대는 잘 훈련되었으며, 그들은 외국의 침략으로부터 나라를 지키기 위해 몇 년을 전쟁의 기술을 연마하는데 보냈습니다. 그들의 수와 지형에 대한 숙달은 확실히 침략자가 조사해야 될 요소일 것입니다."
BRA_state_armies_desc:0 "브라질의 군대는, 간단히 말해서, 리우데자네이루에서 소위 '연방군'으로 불리는 26개 주의 민병대로 이루어진 군집단이고, 브라질의 해군이 실제 연방 정부 산하의 군대의 거의 유일한 무기입니다. 이 거대하며 고풍스럽게 조직된 병력은 훈련과 장비 모두에서 질적으로 매우 다르며, 어떤 면에서도 현대 전투에는 적합하지 않습니다."
BRA_militiagungs_desc:0 "민병대들은 특별 국가 주방위군으로 적절히 통합되었고, 현대적인 방식으로 조직되고 장비를 갖추고 있으며 브라질을 위해 싸우고 죽을 준비가 되어 있습니다."
BRA_merchant_marine_desc:0 "브라질은 항상 국제 무역의 나라였습니다. 그 명성 자체가 브라질의 가장 강력한 수출품인 브라질우드에서 유래되었기 때문입니다. 상품을 수입할 수 있는 우리의 능력은 중요한 전략적 요소이며, 상선의 확장은 공식적으로 국가가 후원합니다."
BRA_patriotism_desc:0 "우리 국민들은 브라질이 하나의 통일국이라는 개념에 서서히 익숙해지고 있지만, 때가 되면, 통합된 정체성을 구축하려는 우리의 노력이 반드시 뿌리를 내릴 것입니다."
BRA_cangaco_is_over_desc:0 "주 사이의 강도율은 사상 최저이며, 시골과 도시 모두 범죄자들이 체포를 피하기 위해 주 경계를 넘나들 수 없기 때문에 훨씬 더 안전하다고 느낍니다."
BRA_higher_learing_desc:0 "대학 교육을 마친 우리나라의 인원을 늘리기 위해 많은 자금이 투입되고 있습니다. 우리는 한때 특권이었던 것을 모두가 접근할 수 있는 것으로 바꾸기를 바랍니다."
BRA_manter_isso_ai_viu_desc:0 "지지 편지에서 수상한 모임에 이르기까지 우리는 정치적, 경제적 안정을 보장하기 위한 조치를 전혀 취하지 않았습니다. 정치는 잔인하고 사악한 게임이지만, 패배의 결과는 혼란스러울 것입니다!"
BRA_cheap_cars_desc:0 "관대한 세금 감면 덕분에, 우리 자동차 산업은 엄청난 효율성과 심지어 더 큰 이익을 위해 일하고 있으며, 주 정부에 우리의 요구에 맞는 모든 종류의 차량을 공급할 수 있습니다."
BRA_black_monday_1_desc:0 "검은 월요일의 우리 경제에 대한 파괴는 엄청난 규모입니다. 우리는 폭풍을 이겨내고 빠르게 줄어드는 예산으로 먹고살려고 노력하는 것 외에는 거의 할 수 없습니다..."
BRA_black_monday_2_desc:0 "새 정부는 우리 경제의 위기를 다루기 위해 적절한 조치를 취해왔고 최악의 상황은 끝났습니다. 그러나, 피해는 여전히 계속되고 있고, 우리 시장에는 공개적인 상처가 있으며, 추가적인 조치가 취해져야 합니다."
BRA_bigger_salaries_desc:0 "대통령 선거 운동 기간 중 약속했던 대로 공무원의 임금 인상률이 공식적으로 증가했습니다. 자연스럽게, 이것은 비용이 들더라도 우리의 정치적 상황을 개선합니다."
BRA_it_prints_money_desc:0 "과도한 지출은 심각한 인플레이션 문제의 시작이 될 수 있는 결과를 낳았습니다. 우리는 이 문제를 즉시 처리해야만 합니다. 우리는 계속 치솟는 물가의 무게로 엄청나게 고통받을 수 있기 때문입니다."
BRA_freedom_of_press_desc:0 "모든 기자들이 모든 문제에 대해 보도할 권리는 자유의 근본적인 측면이며, 우리는 그것이 위험에 처하도록 결코 허용하지 않을 것입니다; 우리의 검열 금지 법안은 아마도 서반구에서 가장 강력할 것입니다."
BRA_freedoms_desc:0 "개인의 권리는 항상 국가의 필요보다 우선합니다: 정부의 최우선 과제는 시민들의 권리를 보호하는 것이어야지, 그것을 빠져나갈 세금 소득 비축금으로 취급해서는 안 됩니다!"
BRA_tax_breakings_desc:0 "검은 월요일 위기의 여파로 인한 긴급 복구 조치로 농가 소유주와 같은 몇몇 전략 부문에 상당한 세금 우대 조치가 내려졌습니다."
BRA_salarys_marlib_desc:0 "한 걸음 뒤로 물러나서 공공 임금을 다시 인상함으로써, 우리는 그들의 인상률을 훨씬 더 합리적인 비율로 정했고, 예산에 친환경적으로 필요한 숨 쉴 공간을 주었습니다."
BRA_marlib_loans_desc:0 "강도 높고 광범위한 재정 개혁은 연방정부와 주정부들의 예산 상황을 크게 개선했습니다."
BRA_am_i_being_detained_desc:0 "우리의 법은 항상 우리의 자유의 초석이 되어왔고, 이 어려운 시기에도 다르지 않습니다. 우리는 항상 다른 무엇보다도 국민의 자유를 존중해야 합니다."
BRA_good_natives_desc:0 "최초의 브라질 사람들은 가혹하지만 공정한 법 아래 보호받고 있으며, 만약 그들이 제국의 나머지에서 고립된 채 살고 싶다면 그렇게 하는 것은 그들의 권리 내에서 충분히 가능합니다. 그들의 고귀하고 순수한 생활방식을 더럽히는 사람은 누구입니까?"
BRA_advisory_parliament_desc:0 "의회는 이제 간단한 자문 역할을 하고 있으며, 군주의 말은 항상 의도했던 대로 최종적이고 절대적인 것입니다."
BRA_anmon_gang_desc:0 "소위 말하는 주정부의 권력은, 브라질을 해체하기 위한 공화당원들의 도구보다 더 적은 것들로 적절히 처리되었습니다. 브라질은 국민들을 위해 일하는 정부에 한 걸음 더 가까워졌습니다."
BRA_are_you_threatening_me_master_jedi_desc:0 "사람들의 의지를 적절하게 대표하는 진정한 유기적이며 분권화된 국가는 현재 현실이 되었습니다. 각 도시마다 생디칼리스트 노예가 생각할 수 있는 것보다 더 많은 자유가 있기 때문입니다. 신은 진정 우리 제국을 축복했습니다."
BRA_blueguard_desc:0 "황실 청위대들은 지적이고 충성스럽습니다; 그들은 외국 스파이들과 생디칼리스트들의 거짓말에 대한 첫 번째 방어선입니다."
BRA_krush_desc:0 "우리는 군 기병대의 전통과 자금 지원을 모두 회복했고, 이제 이 제국의 강력한 방어자들은 그들이 항상 받을 만한 훈련과 장비를 가지고 있습니다."
BRA_stubborness_desc:0 "우리 제국은 아무리 비용이 많이 들더라도 결코 우리를 반대하는 어둠의 세력에게 굴복하지 않을 것입니다!"
BRA_the_romena_desc:0 "새로운 헌법은 브라질에서 시행되고 있으며, 새로운 국가의 법적 기반입니다. 철저하게 권위주의적인 성향으로 인해 반대파들에 의해 '루마니아인'이라고 불렸지만, 실제로 철위대가 내놓을 수 있는 것이 훨씬 급진적입니다, 그러나 비판가들을 '반역자'로 체포할 수 있을 정도로 새로운 헌법은 새로운 국가가 철저하게 통제권을 장악하기 위한 뻔뻔스러운 시도입니다."
BRA_voz_do_brasil_desc:0 "구아나바라 만에서의, 19시간"
BRA_estado_novo_youth_desc:0 "우리 새로운 국가의 젊은이들은 브라질의 번영을 방해하려고 끊임없이 노력하는 생디칼리스트와 다른 폭도들을 다룰 준비가 되어 있습니다."
BRA_populsit_education_desc:0 "브라질 사람들은 가장 어린 시절부터, 가난한 사람들의 아버지가 나라를 완전한 파멸에서 구해냈고 나라를 위대함으로 되돌려 보냈다는 것을 알게 될 것입니다."
BRA_CLT_Vargas_desc:0 "새로운 국가는 항상 노동자들의 이권을 마음에 두고 있었고, 노동자의 권리를 위한 새로운 헌장이 공정하지도 않고 시기적으로도 한참 늦은 것이라고 주장할 사람은 거의 없습니다."
BRA_unlimited_powa_desc:0 "새로운 국가는 남미의 역사상 그 어느 나라보다도 더 큰 중앙집권화를 달성했을 것입니다. 바르가스 개인의 지시도 이 새로운 시대에 법이 될 수 있습니다."
BRA_anarcho_hueism_desc:0 "브라질의 독특한 역사와 문화는 우리가 프랑스와 브리튼에 관련된 생각을 적용할 수 없다는 것을 의미하며, 사유 재산에 대한 엄격한 소유권 감시를 가져서는 안 된다는 것 의미합니다. 정통적인 이념은 브라질의 진보를 방해할 수 없습니다!"
BRA_shrukie_state_desc:0 "물론 어려운 과정이지만, 우리는 주의 기관이 사람들의 삶에 미치는 영향을 줄이는데 많은 노력을 기울이고 있습니다."
BRA_mst_desc:0 "농지는 주로 그 땅에서 일하는 사람들에 의해 소유되고 운영되는 지역 협동조합에 재분배되었습니다. 그러나 개인은 여전히 그들이 땅에 부가하는 가치를 소유할 수 있습니다."
BRA_women_homefront_desc:0 "우리는 전시의 경우, 전 브라질 사람들이 전쟁터 안팎에서 그 역할을 할 준비가 되어있다는 것을 확실히 해야 합니다."
BRA_radsoc_literay_desc:0 "모든 브라질 인이 어디에서 살든지 간에 읽고 쓰는 법을 알 수 있도록 하기 위한 노력의 일환으로 대대적인 파업이 일어나고 있습니다."

BRA_guns_desc:0 "폭정에 대한 최선의 방어는 우리가 지금 하고 있는 것처럼 국민들이 스스로 무장할 수 있도록 하는 것입니다."
BRA_nomnom_desc:0 "우리가 몇 년 안에 달성할 수 있는 어떤 조치로도 굶주림을 없애지는 못할 것입니다. 하지만 우리는 그 목표를 향해 엄청난 발전을 하고 있고, 우리는 짧은 몇 십 년 안에 그가 어디에서 왔든 간에, 그의 일생 동안 단 한 명의 브라질 사람도 음식을 찾는 데 하루도 보내지 않도록 보장할 수 있습니다."
