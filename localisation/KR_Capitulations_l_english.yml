### Events ###
capt.1.t:0 "독일이 정복되다"
capt.1.d:0 "우리는 비열한 적들에게 패배했고 우리 군대는 유럽 전역에서 무너졌습니다. 그들이 우리의 조국을 점령했지만, 전쟁은 아직 끝나지 않았습니다!"
capt.1.a:0 "미텔아프리카의 지배권을 갖는다. 우린 거기서 계속 싸울 것이다."
capt.1.b:0 "도망칠 곳은 없다. 항복한다!"

capt.2.t:0 "독일이 직접 지배를 원하다"
capt.2.d:0 "유럽 본토에서 독일의 전쟁 노력이 좌절된 결과, 카이저께서 [MAF.GetLeader]은 미텔아프리카의 총독에서 즉각 퇴진하고, 그들의 행정 업무를 제국의 공무원들이 아프리카에 도착하는 즉시 이양해야 한다고 명했습니다. 미텔아프리카는 독일에 직접 흡수될 것이고, 우리의 식민 통치는 끝날 것입니다."
capt.2.a:0 "우리는 더 이상 애완견이 아니다! 미텔아프리카 제국의 독립을 선언한다!"
capt.2.b:0 "망명 정부를 환영하고 그들의 요구를 들어줘라."

capt.3.t:0 "미텔아프리카가 독립을 선언하다"
capt.3.d:0 "아프리카 식민지 관료들이 제정신이 아닙니다! 그들은 독일 정부로부터 독립을 선언했고, 우리가 적들과 마주하여 무너질 수 밖에 없도록 관망했습니다!"
capt.3.a:0 "배은망덕한 놈들!"

capt.4.t:0 "미텔아프리카의 복권"
capt.4.d:0 "식민지 행정가들은 미텔아프리카에 대한 완전한 통제권을 카이저의 관료들에게 양도했습니다."
capt.4.a:0 "우리가 이제 아프리카를 지배한다."

capt.5.t:0 "[SIA.GetNameDef]과의 전쟁"
capt.5.d:0 "극동에서 계속되는 전쟁을 처리해야 할 필요가 있습니다. [SIA.GetAdjective] 군대는 여전히 [GEA.GetNameDef]의 식민지 군대와 싸우고 있습니다. 전쟁을 계속해야 할까요? 패잔병만이 남은 우리 군으로는 큰 영향을 끼치지 못할 것입니다. 아니면 평화를 제안할까요?"
capt.5.a:0 "그들이 원하는 것은 무엇이든지 주어라."
capt.5.b:0 "반드시 전쟁을 계속해야 한다면, 우린 전쟁을 계속할 것이다."

capt.6.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap](이)가 휴전을 제안하다"
capt.6.d:0 "독일의 와해된 군대들은, 이제 아프리카로 도망갔으며, 독일이 가진 [GEA.GetNameDef]의 영토 중 상당수를 우리에게 주는 것을 제안해왔습니다. 저들이 수장되기 전에 제안을 받아들인다면 우리는 전쟁을 끝낼 수 있을겁니다."
capt.6.a:0 "훌륭한 계획이야"
capt.6.b:0 "상당수? 우린 전부를 원해"

capt.7.t:0 "[JAP.GetNameDef](과)와의 전쟁"
capt.7.d:0 "It appears we need to deal with the continuing war in the Far East, with [JAP.GetAdjective] armies still fighting against our colonial forces. Should we continue the war, one we almost certainly cannot hope to have much impact on with our scattered and beaten forces, or sue for peace?"

capt.8.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap](이)가 휴전을 제안하다"
capt.8.d:0 "The scattered forces of Germany, now fled to Africa, have offered us much of the colonial territory they hold in Asia, if we will only end the war now before they are drawn in further. Considering that refusing the deal will mean chasing after the Germans in Africa, perhaps we should consider their plan."
capt.8.a:0 "좋은 생각이군"
capt.8.b:0 "모든 걸 점령할 것이다"

capt.9.t:0 "[GEX.GetNameDefCap](이)가 휴전을 제안하다"
capt.9.d.siam:0 "The German government, now fled to Africa and in utter disarray, has arranged for a peace with [From.GetNameDef]. This will involve ceding much of our territory, and there seems little hope of continuing the fight on our own with so many Reich officials already abandoning their offices here in [GEA.GetNameDef]. Our government is in complete disarray, and without support from the homeland it seems there is little we can do."
capt.9.d.japan:0 "The German government, now fled to Africa and in utter disarray, has arranged for a peace with [From.GetNameDef]. This will involve our complete annexation, and there seems little hope of continuing the fight on our own with so many Reich officials already abandoning their offices here in [GEA.GetNameDef]. Our government is in complete disarray, and without support from the homeland it seems there is little we can do."
capt.9.a:0 "To the lifeboats! We're off to Africa!"

capt.12.t:0 "전쟁을 계속해야할까요?"
capt.12.d:0 "The German government has collapsed and fled to Africa, assuming control over their former colonies here. They still possess much of the colonial territory we claim, however, and are in considerable disarray. Should we demand that they turn over the territories, on threat of continuing the war, or end it now?"
capt.12.a:0 "식민지를 요구하라"
capt.12.b:0 "독일과 싸울만큼 싸웠다"

capt.13.t:0 "[NFA.GetAdjective]의 위협"
capt.13.d:0 "[NFA.GetNameDefCap] has issued a threat - either we turn over the colonies which once belonged to them, or they will continue their war against us. Considering our current state of disarray, it might be wise to accept their demands. If not, we will be fighting them here in Africa."
capt.13.a:0 "Give them what they want, if it will end this"
capt.13.b:0 "We face them here in Africa, then"

capt.14.t:0 "독일이 돌아오다"
capt.14.d:0 "With the end of our war, the Germans have finally returned from the new base in Tanganyika to assume control. While there is some lingering resentment here, most are simply relieved to see them."
capt.14.a:0 "Off to Tanganyika we go!"

capt.15.t:0 "[GEA.GetNameDefCap] At Peace"
capt.15.d:0 "With the war in [GEA.GetNameDef] finally over, our colonial administrators have returned them to our control."
capt.15.a:0 "Excellent!"

capt.23.t:0 "The German Collapse"
capt.23.d.nowar:0 "While the last couple of days since the German collapse in Europe have been uncertain, fears that [Root.GetNameDef] would be left to its own devices are unfounded. The main German government has moved to Mittelafrika, and we have restored communications to their officials in Tanganyika. Order, at least for the moment, has been restored."
capt.23.d.war:0 "With the Germans having collapsed in Europe and fled to Africa, the continuing war here in [Root.GetNameDef] has led to many of the colonial officials aleady having fled for the new capital in Tanganyika. Communications have not yet been restored, and it seems that - for the moment - we are on our own."
capt.23.a:0 "That's a relief...?"
capt.23.b:0 "We've been abandoned?!"

capt.40.t:0 "파리 함락"
capt.40.d:0 "It appears we must once again face the ignomity of occupation by a foreign power, as Paris has fallen to enemy control. Resistance throughout France has begun, but how long can we maintain it? There are many both within our nation as well as without who claim we were not a legitimate government to begin with. So long as the people are on our side, however, we still have a chance!"
capt.40.a:0 "We have not lost yet!"

capt.41.t:0 "The French Capitulation"
capt.41.d.ger:0 "With the Commune of France's defeat, we have been asked to turn over control of our controlled territories in France to the German Empire, to better organize the occupation of the region and force an eventual French submission."
capt.41.d.nfa:0 "With the Commune of France's defeat, we have been asked to turn over control of our controlled territories in France to [NFA.GetNameDef], their proper owner. It will be up to them to oversee the occupation and deal with any lingering Communard resistance."
capt.41.a:0 "Of course"
capt.41.b:0 "No, we shall keep what we curently control"

capt.42.t:0 "French Resistance Collapses"
capt.42.d:0 "The occupation of Paris has been solidified, with the various pockets of resistance having been finally been defeated and the legitimacy of our exiled government having been reduced to tatters. The French refusal to admit that we have been defeated once again has finally crumbled in the wake of its inevitability."
capt.42.a:0 "Alas"

capt.43.t:0 "Germany Offers Occupied Territory"
capt.43.d:0 "Perhaps in the interest of undermining the legitimacy of the Commundard exiles, [GER.GetNameDef] has made an offer to the [Root.GetAdjective] government: control over a small number of provinces in the south of France. They make no promises come the eventual peace conference following the eventual collapse of the Commundard resistance. For now, they are willing to simply turn over occupation to us."
capt.43.a:0 "That is a good deal - we'll take it!"
capt.43.b:0 "No, we won't deal with the Germans"

capt.44.t:0 "The French Refuse"
capt.44.d:0 "Despite the benefit it would offer them come the eventual peace conference for French territory, [NFA.GetNameDef] has refused our generous offer."
capt.44.a:0 "So be it"

capt.45.t:0 "The French Agree"
capt.45.d:0 "Obviously delighted by our generosity, [NFA.GetNameDef] has agreed to our offer and has already moved [NFA.GetAdjective] troops into some of the southern territories."
capt.45.a:0 "Excellent"
