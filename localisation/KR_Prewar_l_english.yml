While the moderate social-democrats have been disgraced, French-speaking workers, whose resentment towards the current government and the Federal Army (largely dominated by German-speaking officers) has been growing since the violent repression of a workers' strike in Geneva in 1932, have returned a landslide victory to Socialist and pro-Syndicalist candidates in all cantonal elections, bringing in leftist councils in Geneva, Lausanne and Neuchâtel which are now calling for ambitious reforms."

The situation is getting too dangerous and a move to force the Socialist governments to step down and have new elections in the Romandie seems inevitable, even if it means temporary military occupation of the Romandie by the Federal army.

Socialist leaders, as well as many workers and Syndicalist sympathisers, have been arrested and provisional local governments are being set up under Federal supervision. In spite of our efforts, some Socialist councilors have managed to escape to France and they are now calling for armed resistance against Federal rule and the return of Haute-Savoie to French hands. Despite the repression, the Romandie and now Haute-Savoie are now being plagued by massive strikes and armed incidents as demoblised French speaking Army units form militias. Meanwhile, an unusual concentration of French infantry and tanks is currently exercising in the Jura mountains, and violation of Swiss airspace by French aircraft is becoming more and more frequent."

Our agents have reported numerous atrocities against armed workers and civilians as the Swiss Federal Army has implemented martial law. Despite their best efforts, some French-speaking syndicalist sympathisers have evaded the Federal Army and found a safe haven in our country. They have just set up a Syndicalist Swiss-French government-in-exile and call for the restoration of properly elected officials and the prosecution of the current federal government.

Such atrocities, reported by our state broadcasters, are causing an uproar in France and every true Syndicalist is now ready to free not only Savoie but even the Romands from the clutches of Switzerland's bloodthirsty rulers. As our aircraft are ready to take off and strike against Swiss territory and our troops are concentrating near the border, the Comité de Salut Public has informed Bern that should Haute-Savoie not be evacuated by the Swiss Federal Army and its control transferred to Communal authorities, and Romand political leaders reinstated to their positions, war would be inevitable."

As the reunion of Lothringen to the Reich was to be remembered in Nanzig with a massive military parade and speeches from high-ranking officials, and even if tens of pro-French local leaders and identified Syndicalists had been put under preemptive arrest, the celebrations have been interrupted by massive riots in Nanzig as well as in the whole area up to Metz. Official buildings have been set on fire, armed squads have opened fire against the police on Stanislas square and the Statthalter has barely escaped an assassination attempt in the town hall, while German-speaking homes, shops and factories have been looted by the populace and many German-speaking civilian assaulted or even murdered ; in the countryside and the industrial towns, local representatives of the Reich are targeted by terrorist cells. Mine workers in French-speaking Lothringen are now on strike and despite a swift and ruthless repression, the situation is now getting out of control. Supported by the nationalist feelings of the common people, DVNP members of the Reichstag are calling for a massive deportation of French-speaking people from Lothringen to Silesia and Eastern Prussia ; Lothringen and parts of Elsass are now under martial law, troops are coming from all parts of the Reich to squash the rebellion, and the Kaiser has demanded immediate action to restore order in Lothringen."

As the military parade and speeches from the Statthalter were met by insults and catcalls from the populace, the demonstration has worsened and turned into a riot ; official buildings have been attacked by armed protesters, killing two policemen, and a number of German-speaking civilians have been assaulted by the mob. Even if the police has regained control of the streets and many demonstrators, including French-speaking militant leaders, have been put under arrest, the situation is still extremely tense. Mine workers from French-speaking Lothringen have went on strike and discontent is fuelled by French propaganda.

Military police is currently interrogating the officer and NCO's in charge, but the French, shamelessly taking advantage of the situation, have issued an inflammatory statement demanding official apologies from the Kaiser and Cabinet and threatening Germany of "unpredictable consequences" if we refuse to comply."

prewar.42.d:0 "A regrettable episode has just taken place at the German border during the combined military exercise currently organised around Belfort. A tank platoon, misguided by faulty map directions, has accidentally crossed the border and confused a fake hamlet built for fire exercises with a small Alsatian village named Bretten, shelling this town in the process. German reports suggest that a few civilians have died during the incident. Military intelligence officers have been immediately sent on the spot to investigate and the commanding lieutenant has been put under preventorty arrest. However, the warmongering Germans are outrageously taking advantage of this incident, and the Comité de Salut Public has just recieved an insulting ultimatum from Berlin, demanding an official apology and the ending of our military exercise, under threat of "extremely severe consequences"."

prewar.43.d:0 "Germany has been impressed by our uncompromising stance and has admitted its responsibility in the infamous Leval massacre! After our ambassador in the Hague has informally met a plenipotentary sent by the Chancellor, Berlin has issued a formal apology statement from the Kaiser and has withdrawn some troops from Lothringen, which our recon forces have confirmed. Our Foreign minister, as well as our allies from the Internationale, have asked the Comité de Salut Public to accept this apology. However, such a decision would certainly disappoint a now revengeful and bellicist French public opinion ; more importantly, during an extremely tense secret meeting with the CSP, the General Staff has warned that, should German apology be accepted without further compensations, the Army would not yield to the civil power's decisions without internal dissent and attempts to mutiny."

Active and Landwehr divisions are gathering between Wallonia and Switzerland, while our fighters have been engaged in an isolated dogfight with German planes above Sedan and sporadic gunfire exchanges are reported all along the Lorraine border. War seems now imminent : however, moderate members of the Bourse Générale du Travail are worrying about our level of operational preparedness and have declared that they would vote in favour of a temporary retreat, in order to wait for new tank and bomber models that should be delivered in a few months now. On the other hand, top ranking military officers consider that war is unavoidable and stress the fact that victory can be achieved now with a swift offensive against the heart of the Reich, before Germany can fully use its industrial power."

The Cabinet now wants to give priority to the Lothringen crisis and would be reportedly ready to accept this apology as long as the French military exercise is immediately cancelled, but is wary of the public opinion's reaction ; the Kronprinz has incidentally expressed his wish to "humble the Red murderers" during an improvised press conference in Karlsruhe, and the Generalstab has advised against any sign of leniency that could be misunderstood by the French for a sign of weakness."

As general mobilisation has been ordered by the "Comité de Salut Public", our signal corps units in the West report that massive concentrations of troops, including armoured and motorised formations, have been deployed from Sedan to Belfort, while French fortifications near the Flemish border seem to have been significantly reinforced. At least one French plane has been shot down above German territory, and a few skirmishes have opposed our soldiers to French units near the Lothringen border. A strong majority within the Cabinet and the Kaiser's entourage, encouraged by massive nationalist meetings in all major cities, is eager to declare war and finish the French off for good. However, some military circles are less than enthusiast, warning that the modern, innovative, well-trained French army is nothing like its battered 1919 counterpart and should not be underestimated."

This new claim has been met with fierce opposition from the public opinion and radical factions within both the Bourse Générale du Travail and the Army suggest that all negotiations with Germany should be terminated.
