### Leaders ###
POLITICS_OSCAR_BENAVIDES_LARREA_DESC:0 "Oscar Raimundo Benavides Larrea was born in 1876 in the Peruvian capital, Lima. He graduated military school in 1906 and was sent to France to take part in their manoeuvring exercises. On his return to Perú in 1910, he became involved in the 'Campaña del Caqueta', which allowed him to climb through the ranks until becoming Chief of Staff in 1913. In 1914 he joined the coup against President Billinghurst, becoming provisional president until 1915, where he called for elections after securing stability. He was then sent to Europe as an observer during the Weltkrieg, but resigned his post when Leguía couped the democratic government.\n\nLeguía was quick to react to Benavides return, imprisoning him and sending him along with other political prisoners to exile. However, Benavides managed to organize a successful mutiny in the ship that transported them, escaping to Central America, where he'd support Sanchez Cerro's uprising and later taking an important role in Sanchez Cerro's government.\n\nWith Sanchez Cerro's death, Benavides took advantage of the anarchy that ensued and became Cerro's successor, suspending elections and becoming Perú's new Caudillo. Benavides has adopted the motto 'Order, Peace and Work', rewarding generously displays of loyalty and punishing severely any display of dissent..."
POLITICS_VILLARAN_DESC:0 "Manuel Vicente Villarán Godoy was born in 1873 in the Peruvian capital, Lima. He graduated with a PhD in jurisprudence in 1895 from the 'Universidad San Marcos'. He became a teacher in that same university and would return to his educative role many times during his political career. He was named Minster of Justice, Cult and Instruction during President Leguía's first regime, and would become an active member of Peruvian politics until Leguia's coup in 1919. He was chosen as Principal for the San Marcos University, but rejected his position in protest of Leguia's takeover, and began writing three Manifestos, all of them praising the youthful fighting spirit of his students and warning of the danger that entailed having a Caudillo leading Perú. He was exiled in 1925, but would return in 1927, trying to stay away from politics. During Sanchez Cerro's government, he took part in the subsequent constitutional reforms, although he didn't defend some points that the new constitution brought up. Now that he's president of Perú, he'll take a pragmatic approach to the issues Perú faces, trying to compromise with the UR and focusing on investing in better services and education for the nation."
POLITICS_JOSE_DE_LA_RIVA_DESC:0 "Jose de la Riva Agüero y Osma was born in 1885 in the Peruvian capital, Lima. The grandson of the first Peruvian president, José de la Riva Agüero y Sanchez-Boquete, he graduated from the 'Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos' as a bachelor in literature, philosophy and law, and managed to get a PhD in jurisprudence in 1911. His first political move was to write an article criticizing Leguía's government in that same year, for which he was arrested, triggering the first ever student protest in the history of Perú, which demanded Agüero's release. Agüero was released, where he became a teacher in San Marcos, but when Leguia took over the government in 1919, Agüero wrote a manifesto defending the constitutional order and left in a self-imposed exile towards Europe.\n\nThat travel to Europe changed him, as he was forced to witness the European recovery from the Weltkrieg, as well as the Syndicalist uprisings. It's in these circumstances that he meets D'Annunzio and Italo Balbo, whose far-right philosophy began influencing the once liberal Agüero. He returns in 1927 to Peru, after Cerro deposed Leguia, and began working as a history professor at the 'Pontificia Universidad Catolica'. He at first saw in Cerro just another dictator, but a meeting he had with the Caudillo changed his mind, as his experience in Europe and relation with thinkers like D'Annunzio and Carlés quickly turned him into a friend and close advisor of Sanchez Cerro. Although the hispanist ideals Agüero had were too extreme for Cerro, he was named head of ministers. With Cerro's death, he became his legal successor in the UR, although Benavides took over the real power upon his death. Now that Agüero is in power, he'll try to take Perú in a radical new direction and return the old glory of the Virreynato back to Perú"
POLITICS_EGUIGUREN_DESC:0 "Luis Antonio Eguiguren was born in 1887 in the small town of Piura, Perú. He graduated as bachelor in literature and jurisprudence in 1913 and in Political Science and Administration in 1914. In 1930 he became the Mayor of Lima, but resigned a year later after discrepancies regarding the autonomy of the city's Instruction ministry, and his differences regarding Benavides's Autocratic rule. He left to Ecuador in a self-imposed exile after death-threats towards his family from radical UR members, only to return after Benavides gave signs of wanting to restore democracy to Perú, where the contacts he had gained him a place in the Partido Socialdemocrata. Now that he's President of Perú, he'll do his best to bring peacefully a welfare-system into Perú, trying to compromise with the APRA and the other democratic parties wherever possible."
POLITICS_UGARTECHE_DESC:0 "Jorge Prado Ugarteche was born was born in 1887 in the Peruvian capital, Lima. Son of Mariano Ignacio Prado, who was President of Perú twice in his life, Jorge studied in Law in the 'Universidad de San Marcos' from 1904 to 1909, and then joined the military academy after graduating, becoming lieutenant by 1914. He joined with his brothers to the Partido Civil in 1914, where they helped in the coup d’état that overthrew President Billinghurst. He would later become deputy for the Dos de Mayo province, but would be exiled with his brothers for opposing Leguia's regime.\n\nAfter the assassination of Sanchez Cerro, Benavides, who was a childhood friend of Jorge, recalled him from exile in order to help him in his rule. Jorge began a reform to free political prisoners and recall political exiles that were punished by Sanchez Cerro and Leguia's regimes. However, Ugarteche would be forced to resign due to internal pressure, and Jose de la Riva Agüero would take his place, reinstating the hardline policies against detractors of the regime. Disillusioned with Benavides regime, he formed the Movimiento Democratico with the support of his brothers. Now that Jorge has managed to become President, his belief in the free-market and pro-entente leanings will surely lead to a liberalisation of the Peruvian economy, ushering in a new era of economic prosperity to the nation."
POLITICS_CONSEJO_NACIONAL_DESC:0 "With Agüero's death, the Union Revolucionaria has been thrown into chaos. Factionalism has begun to crack the once unified UR, with many within it vying for power, most notably Luis Alberto Flores Medina, General Ureta Montehermoso and Carlos Miró-Quesada. As long as there's not an elected successor for Agüero, the council will lead Perú forward, albeit with plenty of internal difficulties, until this issue is resolved."
POLITICS_HAYA_TORRE_DESC:0 "Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre was born in the town of Trujillo, La Libertad department, Peru. He signed up for 'Facultad de Letras de la Universidad de Trujillo' when he finished high-school, but would later decide to study to become a Lawyer in the 'Universidad Mayor de San Marcos' in Lima. There he met Manuel Gonzalez Prada, whose anarchist thoughts influenced the young Raul. He joined several protests against the Leguia regime, which would decide to get rid of him by granting him a scholarship to France. However, this move would backfire on Leguia, as the revolutions in Europe would influence young Raul and his friend, Mariategui, towards Syndicalist ideals.\n\nHe would go to Mexico in 1924, and with other Peruvian syndicalist exiles formed the 'Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana' or 'APRA'. The APRA would focus on pan-Americanism (or as Raul liked to call it, 'Indo-Americanism') and fighting imperialism and the burgois oligarchy that had settled in the continent. He'd return to Perú in 1925, settling in the north of the country with his fellow Apristas. In 1929, Raul led the Trujillo takeover, when APRA forces took over the city and proclaimed a Trujillan commune that would be lead by Raul, and executing the local garrison. When the revolt was crushed, he managed to escape to Chile, where he'd join forces with Churata and González Prada in order to strengthen the APRA for a new revolution in 1931.\n\nNow that Raul Haya de la Torre leads Perú, he'll bring about his dream of a worker's utopia for Perú, whatever the cost may be."
POLITICS_CHURATA_DESC:0 "Gamaliel Churata, whose real name is Arturo Pablo Peralta Miranda, was born in 1897 in Puno, Perú. Churata formed several culturalist groups in his youth, through which he met Manuel González Prada, Raul Haya de la Torre, and most importantly, José Carlos Mariategui, who would become a close friend of Churata. He was exiled to Bolivia in 1917, but would return to Perú in 1925, joining up Mariategui in Moquegua as the first group of left-wing indigenist thinkers was formed. When Mariategui finally died in 1930 in Chile, Churata was appointed by his friend in his dying wishes as the leader of the 'Frente Tupacamarista'. In his new role as leader, he'd later gather in 1931 with Raul Haya de la Torre and Alfredo González Prada in order to form a United Front from which bring about the Peruvian revolution. Now that Churata leads Perú, he'll focus on restoring the Andinean cultural identity and purge the Spanish-descendant bourgeoisie from the government, bringing about a new culture and society for the now new country of Piruw."
POLITICS_GONZALEA_PRADA_DESC:0 "Julio Alfredo González de Prada y Verneuil was born in 1891 in Paris, France. The son of known Peruvian anarchist Manuel González Prada, he'd graduate from the 'Universidad San Marcos' as a bachelor in literature in 1910, and would later graduate as a bachelor in Jurisprudence, later achieving a PhD on said career. In 1919, Prada would become the intellectual leader of the newly formed 'Frente Armado Obrero', which would fight for better working rights in its most moderate form and for an outright revolution in its more radical members. Seeing the violence this group generated in Lima, Leguia decided to send the military to suppress the movement, ending the first Peruvian Syndicalist experiment. He then decided to retire from public life temporarily, gathering with other anarchists in Peru until the failed Trujillo rebellion forced him to go to Chile. There he joined forces in 1931 with Raúl Haya de la Torre and Gamaliel Churata with the goal of bringing the revolution to Perú. A staunch believer of Anarchism, now that Prada is in power, he will focus on bringing about his father's vision for a descentralized and free Perú."
POLITICS_MIRO_QUESADA_DESC:0 "Carlos Miró-Quesada Laos was born in 1903 in the Peruvian capital, Lima. He graduated as a Lawyer in Lima in 1932 and joined the Union Revolucionaria. His diplomatic ways with other members and professional handling of propaganda for the party made him quickly rise through the ranks, becoming one of the possible successors to Agüero. Now that Miró-Quesada is in power, he's bound to continue the status-quo Agüero created and keep working forward for Agüero's vision of a glorious Hispanic Perú."
POLITICS_FLORES_DESC:0 "Luis Alberto Flores Medina was born in 1899 in the small town of Ayabaca, Perú. He graduated as a Lawyer from the 'Universidad Mayor de San Marcos' in the late 1910's. He staunchly opposed the government of Augusto B. Leguía, for Flores would be imprisoned. He was freed after a decree by Sanchez Cerro, quickly gaining Flores's loyalty, who joined the Union Revolucionaria soon after. He accompanied Sanchez Cerro in his tour through Arequipa, Puno, Cusco and Ica, and would later become deputy for the UR. After the resign of Francisco Lanatta, Flores becomes the president of the council of ministers. During his time as president of the council, the crews of the Peruvian navy ships 'Almirante Grau' and 'Coronel Bolognesi' mutinied with apparent APRA influence. While Flores didn't believe the crews deserved the death penalty, the martial court determined they were traitors and had to die, so he came to the island of San Lorenzo with the prisoners, where he'd lead the execution personally. It is said that Flores himself forced each sailor to dig his own grave before being shot, earning him a reputation for cruelty in the UR.\n\nFlores became a close follower of Agüero, although he considered the latter to be too conservative in his approach against the APRA. Now that Flores is in power, he'll bring about his vision for a corporatist and totalitarian Perú, free from the influence of the decadent APRA which he'll hunt down relentlessly. However, his rejection of all races outside of the Spanish-descendant Criollos is bound to shine through in his policies, and might upset the local native and Asian population..."
POLITICS_URETA_DESC:0 "Eloy Gaspar Ureta Montehermoso was born in 1892 in Chiclayo, Lambayeque department, Perú. He graduated as an artillery second lieutenant from the Escuela Militar de Chorrillos in 1913. After beginning studies in the Escuela Superior de Guerra, he'd be sent to Italy and France to perfect his ability as an artillery officer. A decorated officer, he joined the UR due to his ultra-conservative views and admiration for Agüero, even if they both had their differences. Now that Ureta leads the UR and Perú, he'll try to instill in the Peruvian society at large the patriotism and discipline he was taught as a cadet."
POLITICS_ODRIA_DESC:0 "José Manuel Arturo Odría Amoretti was born in 1896 in the city of Tarma, Junin department, Perú. He graduated the Escuela Militar as an infantry second lieutenant, where his grades were so high that he was granted an honorary sword, and named instructor for the school. He continued perfecting his military ability throughout his career, taking an important role in the war against Ecuador, but he never truly prepared to be a politician. As such, now that he's in power, he'll seek to restore the Peruvian democracy, but not before restoring stability to the country and enacting laws to prevent future Caudillismo. However, his rejection of the native population may cause trouble with the large Quechua-speaking minorities in the country...."
POLITICS_BUSTIOS_DESC:0 "Reynaldo Chukiwanka Ayulo Choquehuanca, better known by his regnal name, Pachacutec II, was born in 1914 in Lampa, Puno Province, Perú. The son of Francisco Chukiwanka Ayulo and considered one of the descendants of the Incan emperor, Huayna Capac, he has taken advantage of his father's popularity to rally the Indians to his cause. His father graduated as a lawyer in 1908 from the 'Universidad de Arequipa' and would go to Puno, Perú, where he began fighting for better rights for natives and created an alphabet in which natives could write Aymara, Quechua and Spanish, helping the native population to improve its literacy rates as these languages conflicted with the latin alphabet. Reynaldo became involved in French émigré circles and was influenced by the writings of Charles Maurras. Seeing the government mistreating the native populations, Reynaldo took over his father's institutions and began going from village to village rallying the natives for an insurrection to finally be free of the Criollo oppression."
