### Leaders ###
POLITICS_SAID_TAIMUR_DESC:0 "The Al Said dynasty, which had reaped the benefits of British support in the 19th century, still lives. Following the Peace with Honor in 1921, the young Said bin Taimur accelerated through his political education in Muscat. The former Sultan Taimur bin Feisal had prepared a wise council for his son in 1935 when he abdicated the throne. Said bin Taimur was left with a sense of superiority over the Shia in the Trucial coast and the Ibadi tribesman in Oman proper. More concerning was the new Sultan's attitude towards Dhofaris. Said bin Taimur has taxed them mercilessly, and remained silent to the slave trade that opresses Dhofar."

OMA_hierarchy_reorganization:0 "군사 위계 재조직"

OMA_dhofar_railway:0 "도파르 철도"
OMA_dhofar_railway_desc:0 "Now that we have at least one major rail line though Muscat itself, we need to integrate the rest of Oman with this rail line. Goods and citizens from as far away as Dohfar will be able to get across the entire country in less than a day's travel.

OMA_local_manufactury_incentives_desc:0 "We need to provide local incentives in Oman to utilise all the spare labor the state cannot effectively utilise.

OMA_imperial_army_officers:0 "제국 군사 고문단"
OMA_imperial_army_officers_desc:0 "Persia has demanded that in return for our protection, they be able to embed a small amount of their officers into all the units of our army.

OMA_egyptian_mediation:0 "이집트의 중재"
OMA_egyptian_mediation_desc:0 "Let us petition some of our Arab friends to help us mediate the disputes we have with the rest of the Arabian Peninsula. Certainly, this will keep the people calm, and not concerned about the effect going to more outside infidel help would have on our country."

OMA_solve_issues_with_yemen_desc:0 "Yemen has long had claims on the Dohfar region. We need to negotiate and solve these issues with Yemen, and Egypt will be a fair mediator in this issue.

oma.1.t:0 "오만 소개"
oma.1.d:0 "Oman's splendid isolation did not end with the Weltkrieg and the Sultan hoped it wouldn't end any time soon. However, the wheel of fate stops for no one, and their protectors in Britain and India fell into utter and complete disarray. Worse, Saudi forces moved into the Trucial States, and war was coming fast to Oman, and it seemed the tale of the Ibadi Sultanate was finally at an end.\n\nHowever, the much feared war never came. The warriors mobilised by the state never saw battle against the Ikhwan and the Saudis, for the costly campaign in the Trucial States took too long… or perhaps Ibn Saud has other, more obscure plans in his mind? Regardless of reason, Oman stood alone, and has not received aid from British India in a decade. This may very well become an extremely worrisome state of affairs as instability rapidly spreads throughout the region.\n\nBut to properly fight external threats, internal ones must be properly dealt with. More specifically the Imamate of Oman, and the tribes that have their allegiance to the Hinterlands Imam higher than to Muscat; not to mention the degraded and archaic state of the Monarchy. But if these challenges can be overcome, Oman's tale is not to end so soon."

oma.9.d:0 "Ever since the Saudis invaded the Trucial States after the collapse of the British hegemon, we have been at risk of Arabian invasion from the north.
