POLITICS_SONG_ZHEYUAN_DESC:0 "Born during the waning years of the 'century of humiliation', Song was educated by his uncle, a Confucian teacher in Yanshan, Shandong. In 1904, Song traveled to Beijing to learn recieve military instruction under Lu Jianzhang. After a decade of service, Lu Jianzhang slotted Song into service under Yuan Shikai during his rise. Following the assault on Zhang Xun in Beijing, Song deserted Yuan to join the KMT, and threw in his loyal divisions under their government. In 1925, Song requested Chiang governorship of Shandong should the province be claimed. The subsequent Northern Expedition fell apart for Song in 1929, and he held Linyi in Shandong against Zhang Zongchang. Any hope of reinforcements were dashed by 1930, depriving Song of legitimacy. A solution to this crisis in confidence came when Song heard the Duke Yansheng was in mortal danger. Living in the Mount Tai Miao, the descendant of Confuicius was threatened by the newly-arrived Yiguandao, which desputed his orthodox religion. Song organized a rescue of the Duke Yansheng in 1931, and his conspirators swore an oath upon his rescue to create the Society for Restoring Benevolence."
POLITICS_ZHANG_ZONGCHANG_DESC:0 "Zongchang himself felt no great national pride for Qingdao when it was lost in 1897 to Germany, but the 1911 revolution did motivate him to action. Arriving in Shanghai to pledge allegiance to the Republic, he fell in with Feng Guozhang and joined the Zhili Clique when they emerged in 1917. When the Fengtian and Zhili Clique turned on each other in 1920, Zongchang was withdrawing his forces from across Northern China back into Shandong. This allowed Zongchang to commit most of his forces to the Fengtian Clique when Zhang Zhoulin made peace with Sun Yat Sen in 1926. Zongchang ordered his army again to retreat into Shandong when the Fengtian Clique needed him most. This retreat made Shandong into his prison as well as refuge, where he was an illegal but tolerated occupying force under the shadow of the Qing. An ability to utilize railroads effectively as well as the unusual charisma of a man referred to as “filthy” by even his allies carried him through to victory. As medicine was out of his reach financially, a bout of sickness drew him up the 6,600 steps to a Yiguandao doctor. Zongchang eventually met the Yiguandao’s Honored Teacher, Zhang Tianran. Whether it was his sickness or the lack of anything else to do up on Mount Tai, Zongchang promised Tianran that he would follow the esoteric lifestyle espoused by the cult for his health."
POLITICS_ZHANG_TIANRAN_DESC:0 "Tianran aspired to nothing in his life until he was introduced into the cult of Lu Zhongyi. Lu Zhongyi was the leader of a small group of religious syncretists called the Yiguandao in 1918. Lu Zhongyi had always planned for his sister Lu Zhongjie to succeed him to lead the Yiguandao, and had even recognized her supposed divinity as the reincarnation of the Buddhist God Guan Yin. A theological schism occurred after the passing of Lu Zhongyi in 1930, wherein Lu Zhongjie took followers loyal to her out of the Yiguandao and relocated to Henan, where they remain to this day. Tianran, having the full trust of his members as well as a newly divined wife Sun Suzhen, began to tell startling revelations. In 1922, Tianran had built a shrine on Mount Tai, which grew until it encompassed the other monasteries on the mountain. By 1924 Mount Tai had become the year-round home for Zhang Tianran and his inner circle. A spirit writing session that same year foretold Emperor Puyi was in danger of being poisoned, and a trip to Beijing was planned. Tianran amused and flattered Emperor Puyi with promises that the Yiguandao would reinforce loyalty to the Qing through charity and warfare if need be. The first Red Spears and Big Swords arrived to Mount Tai in 1925. The greatest catch was Tianran’s supposed conversion of Zhang Zongchang in 1935."

Li's first major decoration was in fighting the Wuchang Uprising of 1911. An association with Anhui general Qu Tongfeng guided Li towards clique politics during the republican years. Like Qu Tongfeng, who was cast out of the Anhui Clique for corruption, Li was set adrift and found his way into the Fengtian clique in 1924. Grand Marshal Zhang Zuolin reassigned Li that year to Zhang Zongchang, who was fighting in Zhili. Li was initially impressed with Zhang Zongchang's ability in spite of his lack of manners, but this appreaisal turned sour by 1928, when Zongchang became entrenched in Shandong. Li, despite his history of corruption, could not properly pay his division on taxes collected honestly in Shandong. Li, having taken inspiration from the decleration of Xue Dian as the Yiguandao's minor Emperor in Shandong, decided to present himself as spiritually enlightened. Li publicly began training in Wudang swordsmanship, and named himself 'the Magic Sword' to provide an air of mystery. This ultimately caught the attention of Zhang Tianran who has given Li several offers to train with Big Sword militas at Taishan."

This service continued when Feng Yuxiang joined Yuan Shikai, and ended in Feng Anbang's desertion of Feng Yuxiang following Zhang Xun's failure in 1917. This betrayal led Feng Anbang into the Anhui Clique, and served as an infantry commander for them until 1924. This relationship ended when Feng Anbang was accused of taking bribes, leading to a forced retirement to Shandong. Feng's experience commanding infantry was not forgotten, and he was hired by the incoming Zhang Zongchang to train his army in 1931. In exchange, Zongchang forwarded a pardon for Feng's crimes from Zhang Zuolin, which enables Feng to move freely once more. Feng commanded some of Zongchang's soldiers throughout the early 1930s to assault bandit holdings in central Shandong, becoming recognized for his discipline above most commanders in Shandong."

The Zhang family, seeing the future in western businesses up north, moved Huizhi to Tianjin at a young age. As a student at the Tianjing military equipment school, Zhang Huaizhi join in the Boxer rebellion with his regiment, and was commended for bombarding the Legation quarter. The guilt of losing to the westenrers drove the disgraced Zhang into the army of Yuan Shikai, whose ambitious goal of becoming an Emperor felt like more of a natural evolution for Zhang than republicanism. After Yuan died, Zhang fell in with the Anhui clique, and briefly served under Zhang Shuyuan as an administrator in Shandong in 1918. Zhang eventually failed his leader again after his regiment fell fighting in Hunan. This left Zhang Huaizhi destitute again, and the only people who would take him was the Yiguandao.

Many peasants have entrusted Zhang with their lives posessions, others have sworn themselves to fight in the Red Spears for Shandong. On a sunny day, a woman wearing winter garb from Beijing approached Zhang Tianran. The Yiguandao guards claim she is a matriarch like Tianran's wife, Sun Suzhen, but she stands before him with two pistols on her belt. Zhao Hong Wenguo, mother of Beijing student leader Zhao Dong, is here to offer her families services to the Yiguandao. Zhao Hong Wenguo claims to do this not out of religious loyalty or financial need, but because the Yiguandao appears to her the essential resistance against Japanese agression that threatens her home. The Honored Master agrees, and reiterates his promise to never cooperate with the Japanese in exchange for her families financial and tactical services.

Tianran and Suzhen have both collaborated on a book entitled 'Provisional Etiquette', intended to demonstrate how the Yiguandao respects the spiritual lineage of chinese leadership. To Zhang Tianran, who was once a minor bureaucrat under Yuan Shikai, the spiritual lineage of China's dictator went from the the Regent Zaifeng to Yuan Shikai, then finally to the enthroned Puyi. To Sun Suzhen however, spiritual lineage in China belonged to Sun Yat-Sen, and through Sun Yat-Sen's death there is no true spiritual leader of China currently.

The last aeon, that of the Red Sun, ended with the Xinhai Revolution. The Confucian legend Kang Yuowei is refenced in Zhang Tianran's speech, which agreed that the third age, Datong, or Maha-Kalpa was dawning. Soon, claims Tianran, the Chinese people will be perfected racially or be destroyed by foreigners like the Japanese Emperor or the British Empire.\n\nTo the uncertain people of Shandong, the only concrete suggestion out of so much esoteric ado is that they should work harder towards national unification, and reinforces the already-prevelant feeling of existential struggle they feel."

Our overreliance on traditional farming is likely the cause, but trying to move away from it would enrage the farmers who have been using the same tried and true methods for thousands of years. We could always begin to implement new, modern farming techniques from westerners, and run the risk of alienating our supporters who look to us for traditional guidance, or we could devote a sizable portion of our Red Spears to help the farmers and make sure we do not have a famine."

Buddhist Teachers in training on Taishan have already heard the news, and their indecision has caused several to abandon the Yiguandao.

After following a tip that the Teacher Juzan spoke to Lu Zhongjie when he published his defamation againt us, the Red Spears snuck into Hunan. One of our most loyal minor Emperors has managed to hunt her down and bring her back to us, after all these years. Within the inner circle, a debate rages over how to handle this windfall. To Zhang Tianran and Sun Suzhen, keeping Lu Zhongjie alive is tempting further dissenters to venerate her as the reincarnated Guan Yin. To the Red Spears and their leader Xue Dian, Lu Zhongjie was so feeble that she poses no threat to them.

In this field, Beijing illuminaries like Wu Peifu and Chen Huanzhang have made their own interpretation of the Confucian canon known. What seperates Kong Dechang's first publication from others is its rejection of attempts to revive state-enforced piety. While Wu Peifu and Chen Huanzhang have decried their times as impious, Kong Dechang has stated that each individual family in China defines piety through their actions.

Yet still there is mining in Eastern Shandong. A more radical solution has been concocted, which has Zhang Zongchang fund a coal miner syndicate to empower coal miners to fight their bosses.
