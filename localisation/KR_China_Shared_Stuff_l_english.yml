Although we have bested threats on battlefield, a set of campaigns to dismantle the support bases of our rivals, to seize their assets, and abrogate their treaty ports will be necessary to ensure our future peace. Our government has reclaimed territories that belongs to our former enemy. Establishing local administrations is critical to our future success.[GetIntegrateChina]"

### Army Reform
china_army_decisions:0 "육군 개혁"
china_army_decisions_desc:0 "Chinese armies have long struggled to catch up to Western standards. Soldiers are notoriously poorly trained and disorderly, often recruited from a varied stock of bandits, petty criminals, and the chronically destitute. Equipment is regularly patchwork, obsolete, or even downright archaic. Loyalty is typically given to individual officers, or a regularly filled ricebowl, and ideological motivation is ephemeral at best. It will take a great deal to rebuild these armies along modern lines."

china_shared.1.t:0 "Fading Legitimacy"
china_shared.1.d:0 "The United Front may have brought a measure of unity to our fractured country, but the internal conflicts between Chinese factions never truly ended. Now, our losses in the face of the Japanese invasion have forced our government to recognize a simple truth: we can no longer claim to be China's leader in the face of foreign invasion. Already forces under various warlords and regional governments have begun routinely ignoring our directives in favor of those from [current_china_leader.GetNameDef]. Unless we push forward and retake our lost territory we stand to permanently lose our leadership status."
china_shared.1.a:0 "Drat."

china_shared.2.t:0 "A United Front"
china_shared.2.d:0 "With Japan's invasion beginning to gather steam, [Root.GetLeader] has decided to make a call for national unity against the invader, even if it means fighting alongside our former enemies. Even as the country's communication infrastructure has come under threat, the message will go out at once - by courier if necessary!"
china_shared.2.a:0 "For China!"

china_shared.3.t:0 "A Call For Unity"
china_shared.3.d:0 "Scholars, intellectuals, and various idealogues have made calls for national unity against foreign aggression routinely over the years. It has been a nice rallying cry, if one that often fell on deaf ears. Now, with Japan's invasion rolling across a significant portion of the country,[From.GetNameDef] has made a call for a temporary alliance against Japan, and this time perhaps other leaders will listen. Even the most cynical must admit that China's fate seems to hang in the balance."
china_shared.3.a:0 "Yes, we must band together."
china_shared.3.b:0 "We shall never fight alongside them!"

china_shared.4.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Joins the United Front"
china_shared.4.d:0 "[From.GetNameDef] has joined the United Front, pledging all their resources and influence to the anti-Japanese cause. This will not bring an end to any historical rivalries, or claims to legitimate national leadership, but nontheless our troops will now be fighting side by side against the foreign aggressor."
china_shared.4.a:0 "Excellent."

china_shared.5.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap]'s Betrayal"
china_shared.5.d:0 "In an act of wanton betrayal, [From.GetNameDef] has refused to join the United Front. There can be no excuse for putting individual interests before the fate of all China!"
china_shared.5.a:0 "Traitors!"

china_shared.6.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Offers a Ceasefire"
china_shared.6.d:0 "[From.GetNameDef] has offered to implement a ceasefire, solely in the national interest, and until such a time as the Japanese invasion is halted. The agreement is conditional on the transfer of all occupied territories on both of our sides, however."
china_shared.6.a:0 "Yes. For now."
china_shared.6.b:0 "We shall never fight alongside them!"

china_shared.7.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Accepts Ceasefire"
china_shared.7.d:0 "[From.GetNameDef] has accepted the proposed ceasefire and joined the United Front. All occupied states in both sides are to be transferred accordingly."
china_shared.7.a:0 "A fair price."

china_shared.8.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses a Ceasefire"
china_shared.8.d:0 "[From.GetNameDef] has refused the offered ceasefire."
china_shared.8.a:0 "Traitors!"

china_shared.9.t:0 "Formation of the United Front"
china_shared.9.d:0 "Ever since the Japanese invasion cries have gone up across the country for a united front against Japanese aggression, and now they have been heard. Today marks the formation of the United Front, dedicated to the expulsion of the Japanese and their influence from our Chinese soil. Now our fates are tied as one, and there can be only victory or anhiliation."
china_shared.9.a:0 "The Japanese must be defeated."

china_shared.10.t:0 "Collapse of the United Front"
china_shared.10.d:0 "Even as the war with Japan began to move toward its close, many in China were already making covert moves toward one side or another in the post-war order. With Japan now defeated, those suppressed conflicts have again come to the fore, and what was one a united front has began a rapid slide into infighting. Now the final phase of China's unification wars has begun."
china_shared.10.a:0 "One last obstacle towards unity."

china_shared.11.t:0 "The United Front Forms"
china_shared.11.d.pro_JAP:0 "It seems some of our fellow Chinese, unwilling to acknowledge our latest string of victories, have deicded to band together against us and our Japanese allies. While Tokyo is already considering this last-ditch alliance insignificant, we know China better than they ever could, and that a long fight still awaits ahead." #Pro-Japan Chinese POV
china_shared.11.d.anti_JAP:0 "After a string of secret meetings carried out over several weeks, several Chinese political factions including our own have agreed to stand together against the oncoming Japanese invasion. Unity has been elusive for decades, but now with the formation of the Chinese United Front the country finally stands a chance at repelling the Japanese invader, and crushing his traitorus allies." #Anti-Japan Chinese POV
china_shared.11.d.JAP:0 "It seems that several Chinese factions, unwilling to acknowledge our latest string of victories and the overwhelming superiority of our armies, have deicded to band together against us. It is difficult to imagine the squabbling, cliquish Chinese truly working together toward a common cause, and our commanders have assured us that theirs is ultimately a futile measure. We will be sipping Sake amid the ruins of their headquarters by the end of the year." #Japanese POV
china_shared.11.d.others:0 "It seems that the Chinese, in their desperation to slow the Japanese invasion of their country, have formed an alliance. Few expected the typically squabbling, cliquish Chinese factions to make such a move, and now many will watch their future with considerable interest." #Foreign POV
china_shared.11.a:0 "Onward."
china_shared.11.b:0 "Wansui!"
china_shared.11.c:0 "Banzai!"
china_shared.11.e:0 "Interesting."

Even now further Japanese troops pour onto the North China Plain, and the time has come for the government to consider retreat. Fortunately China is vast, and the creation of a national redoubt may let us ride out the oncoming storm. The government has already begun preparations to flee to [china_national_redoubt.GetCliqueShortName], and its offices are filled with frantic activity. But, outside, the streets of the provisional capital are filled with a dead air and sombre air, roamed only by those poor souls too wretched to flee westward.
