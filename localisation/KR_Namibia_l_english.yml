### Events ###
nam.1.t:0 "남서아프리카가 지원을 요청하다"
nam.1.d:0 "비록 미텔아프리카는 무너졌지만, 아프리카의 남서부에는 아직도 우리에게 충성하는 나미비아가 남아있습니다. 나미비아는 미텔아프리카에서 독일인의 지배를 받는 마지막 지역으로서, 그들의 투쟁에 대한 우리의 지원을 요청하고 있습니다. 우리가 그들을 돕지 않는다면, 우리의 아프리카에 대한 마지막 지배력은 사라질지도 모릅니다..."
nam.1.a:0 "마땅히 그들을 도울 것이다."
nam.1.b:0 "아프리카는 이미 끝났어."

nam.2.t:0 "독일이 지원을 보내오다!"
nam.2.d:0 "아직 희망이 끝난 것 같지는 않습니다. 독일에서 우리의 투쟁을 돕기 위해 군수품과 물자를 보내왔습니다. 앞으로도 그들이 우리를 도울 수 있기를 희망합시다."
nam.2.a:0 "우리는 승리할것이다!"

nam.3.t:0 "독일이 지원을 거부하다"
nam.3.d:0 "독일은 더 이상 아프리카를 투자할 가치가 있는 곳으로 여기지 않는 것 같습니다. 우리의 지원 요청은 거부당했고, 미래에도 지원이 올 가능성은 희박해 보입니다."
nam.3.a:0 "우리 힘으로도 충분히 이길 수 있다."

nam.4.t:0 "남서아프리카에서 추가 지원을 요청하다"
nam.4.d:0 "나미비아에서는 여전히 전쟁이 이어지고 있습니다. 이에 나미비아에서는 추가적인 지원을 요청했습니다. 아프리카에서의 우리의 통제력을 확고히 하는 것도 중요하지만, 우리는 이미 무너져 버린 미텔아프리카의 신기루에 집착하고 있는 것일지도 모릅니다..."
nam.4.a:0 "그들이 필요로 하는 만큼 도울 것이다."
nam.4.b:0 "한 번이면 충분하다."

nam.5.t:0 "독일이 추가적인 지원을 수락하다!"
nam.5.d:0 "관대한 독일은 북쪽의 반역자들을 물리치기 위해 우리에게 추가적인 인력과 물자를 보내주었습니다. 이대로라면 이 전쟁은 우리의 승리가 확실해 보입니다."
nam.5.a:0 "승리는 우리의 것이다!"

nam.6.t:0 "독일이 추가적인 지원을 거부하다"
nam.6.d:0 "독일인들은 아프리카의 문제보다 유럽 본토의 문제에 집중하기로 한 것 같습니다.  두 번째 지원 요청은 거부되었고, 우리는 남은 전쟁을 온전히 우리의 힘으로 치루어야 할 것 같습니다."
nam.6.a:0 "실망스럽군."

nam.7.t:0 "Namibia Requests Workers"
nam.7.d:0 "Namibia is still fighting it's civil war in the name of our country, and is requesting assistance for a third time. This time they are trying to fortify their capital in case of their forces being pushed back. This could help their survival in the long run, so it seems like a worthy investment."
nam.7.a:0 "Send our workers."
nam.7.b:0 "They'll be able to win on their own."

nam.8.t:0 "Germany Assists Us"
nam.8.d:0 "Our generous allies up in Germany have given us a small amount of workers in order to build the fortifications. Taking our capital will be much more difficult once this project is complete."
nam.8.a:0 "Send the workers."

nam.9.t:0 "The Fortifications are Complete"
nam.9.d:0 "The project has been complete, resulting in medium fortifications being built in our capital. This will help us in the civil war and in the long run for the future reunification of Mittelafrika."
nam.9.a:0 "Victory is in our hands."

nam.10.t:0 "Germany Doesn't Send Workers"
nam.10.d:0 "Germany has decided to not send workers to come to our aid, which will significantly increase the amount of time it will take to fortify Windhuk."
nam.10.a:0 "We'll do it on our own."

nam.11.t:0 "An Assault on Namibland"
nam.11.d:0 "At the beginning of the revolt, Namibland sent divisions behind our lines as a distraction for our forces. Our generals seem to have gotten a similar idea and wish to send a small expedition to sneak behind enemy lines and launch a ambush. Should we accept their plan?"
nam.11.a:0 "Approve the proposal."
nam.11.b:0 "Deny the proposal."

nam.12.t:0 "The Assault is Ready"
nam.12.d:0 "Our troops have successfully snuck through the disorderly lines of Namibland, and are ready to launch the assault whenever we give the word. The timing here is important, we don't want our units to be destroyed right as they arrive."
nam.12.a:0 "We'll time it carefully."

nam.13.t:0 "Our Units are Found"
nam.13.d:0 "Our units were almost at their destination in the back of the enemy lines, until a patrol discovered them. They were all massacred, leaving only one soldier to report the bloody incident. Trying something like this again would be futile and only result in more loses."
nam.13.a:0 "Scrap the plan."

nam.14.t:0 "Südwestafrika Launches an Assault"
nam.14.d:0 "Südwestafrika has adopted a similar tactic to us at the start of the war, and launched an assault in the middle of our territory. It's also right next to our capital, leaving it in grave danger of being captured. We must rush troops there now if we wish to win this battle!"
nam.14.a:0 "Send the army, quickly!"

nam.15.t:0 "Südwestafrika Wins the War!"
nam.15.d:0 "Südwestafrika has been embroiled in a civil war ever since Mittelafrika has collapsed, but they have beaten back the foolish natives. With the conflict over, Südwestafrika has invited us to establish rule over them once again. Once our delegates arrived, there were talks floating about reforming Mittelafrika, but they remain rumours for now."
nam.15.a:0 "Not all is lost."

nam.16.t:0 "A New Statthalter?"
nam.16.d:0 "With the crisis finally being officially over, it is time we decide who the official Statthalter will be. There were various suggestion and three Weltkrieg veterans who fought in Sudwestafrika have been put up for the task. The first option is keeping Heinrich Kircheim, the current Statthalter who advocates for overwhelming the inferior African opponents with superior German firepower, the second is Hans Hollander, who advocates for mobilizing the African population to see a quick and sudden reunification of Mittelafrika, and the third option, Theodor von Hippel who thinks careful planning and thinking three steps ahead is the key to our expansion."
nam.16.a:0 "Heinrich Kircheim, who led us through the recent war."
nam.16.b:0 "Hans Hollander, for a quick reunification."
nam.16.c:0 "Theodor von Hippel, for his careful planning."

nam.17.t:0 "Resistance from Ovambo"
nam.17.d:0 "Despite our victory in the Ovambo's revolt, there is still staunch resistance among a new group known as the 'Ovambo Movement', who raid towns in the hopes of letting the Ovambo people be free. This is all due to their leader, Uushona Shiimi managing to escape our clutches in the civil war. With towns being raided the conflicts do not show any signs of stopping, and the people demand we do something about the problem."
nam.17.a:0 "Search for Uushona Shiimi."
nam.17.b:0 "Focus on defending the people."

nam.18.t:0 "Uushona Shiimi Killed"
nam.18.d:0 "Uushona Shiimi who has been a thorn in our side since our reunification has been killed by loyal Askari troops at 6:12 inside a hotel inside Onajena. Although the initial thought was that the people would resent us for our actions, a lot are thanking us for dispersing the Ovambo revolt."
nam.18.a:0 "He's finally gone."

nam.19.t:0 "Amboland Integrated"
nam.19.d:0 "With the end of the Ovambo Movement's momentum, the north of our country has finally entered a state of calm and healing. With this, we can finally stand under a strong, united nation that can face external threats."
nam.19.a:0 "We are united."

nam.20.t:0 "Local Village Destroyed"
nam.20.d:0 "Although we have placed military police at key locations within our country, it seems some areas got inevitably overlooked and The Ovambo Movement took notice. They have managed to raid a village of all it has, slaughtering the entire population and seizing many supplies. The peaceful section of the Ovambo people are also blaming us for painting their culture in a bad light by letting these actions continue."
nam.20.a:0 "Spread out the police force."

nam.21.t:0 "Uushona Shiimi Killed in Battle"
nam.21.d:0 "Following the recent wave of momentum in The Ovambo Movement, Uushona Shiimi himself decided to lead an expedition on a seemingly unguarded village. Little did he know that military forces were lying in wait for him, and attacked him on sight. The brave regiment managed to kill Uushona Shiimi, but the unit was wiped out by the grunts left over from the expedition. Although we have managed to end the momentum of the movement, this is a general distaste inside our population for letting this problem continue for so long."
nam.21.a:0 "At least it's over."

nam.22.t:0 "Rumours of Namibian Oil"
nam.22.d:0 "Rumours have been circulating as of late of possible oil hidden within Namibia's crust, the question is whether these are truly rumours or truth. If these rumours are indeed true, this will result in Namibia going from a depopulated wasteland to a place of much wealth and trade, transforming the entire economy. However, to even search for the black gold will require many resources Germany is not willing to give. All that remains is deciding how much we are willing to invest in this."
nam.22.a:0 "Do a quick search."
nam.22.b:0 "Divert some of our funds towards the project."
nam.22.c:0 "This must be a priority."
nam.22.e:0 "Let's not waste our time."

nam.23.t:0 "Oil was Found!"
nam.23.d:0 "Oil! The black gold that was originally thought to be a simple rumour less than a month ago is now truth. With this brings significant wealth and resources that we can provide to the fatherland, all we need to do now is extract it all."
nam.23.a:0 "Namibia is a gold-mine."

nam.24.t:0 "The Search goes Nowhere"
nam.24.d:0 "Despite vigorous searching, the oil is nowhere to be found. The entire project has proven to be a waste of resources and generally worthless. The hopes of Namibia ever being a profitable colony have been stomped to the ground and morale is at an all time low."
nam.24.a:0 "What a waste of time."

nam.25.t:0 "The Reformation of Mittleafrika"
nam.25.d:0 "With most of the German African territories being recovered by our skilled administration, we can officially consider Mittelafrika to be rebuilt once again in the name of the empire."
nam.25.a:0 "Most thought it to be impossible, but they were wrong."

nam.26.t:0 "Südwestafrika Requests Supplies"
nam.26.d:0 "Südwestafrika has found itself embroiled in a conflict with one of the treacherous African warlords, and is requesting our assistance. It would be wise to assist, as every gun we drop down there helps us get closer to the reformation of Mittelafrika, and our presence in Africa."
nam.26.a:0 "Send the supplies."
nam.26.b:0 "We can't spare anything at the moment."

nam.27.t:0 "Germany Sends Help"
nam.27.d:0 "Germany has decided to assist us in our current conflict. It is always good to know that Germany itself will always have our back in our quest for vengeance against these traitorous warlords."
nam.27.a:0 "Reunification is near."

nam.28.t:0 "We Fend for Ourselves"
nam.28.d:0 "Germany has decided against helping in this current conflict, claiming to not have more important things to do on the mainland. We will have to fight this one on our own, but we will be fine against this barbari scum."
nam.28.a:0 "We'll win on our own."

nam.29.t:0 "Barotseland Resists our Occupation"
nam.29.d:0 "With the success of the Barotseland campaign, the area has largely devolved into anarchy with King Yeke III dying of a stroke after our victory. Without any leadership, the Barotseland people have begun to fight the troops trying to keep the peace and are disrupting further planning for expansion into Africa. The threat will need to be dealt with soon, before support can reach into other areas we control as well."
nam.29.a:0 "Damn traitors."

nam.30.t:0 "[GetYear] Syndicalist Convention"
nam.30.d:0 "With the revolution finally being brought to Namibia, we must hold a convention like all formal Syndicalist countries. Three main parties have ended up being contenders. There is the Radical Socialist RAP, which is run by young revolutionaries who wanted to be free from Mittelafrika, the SSP which wanted to bring a revolution to the entirety of Mittelafrika, and the Internationale aligned SPI which believe a European Revolution is necessary before an African one. The victor turned out to be..."
nam.30.a:0 "The Internationale aligned SPI."
nam.30.b:0 "The revolutionary SSP"
nam.30.c:0 "The young ARP"

nam.31.t:0 "Dealing with the German-Namibians"
nam.31.ds:0 "German Namibians are a minority among normal Namibians, which migrated here when the German came into control in the 1880s. Unexpectedly, German Namibians have merged well with the Namibian culture and have even formed their own subculture among normal Namibians. However, some radical factions within the Congress think all German Namibians should be removed from Namibia, as they serve as a reminder of our time under imperialist German rule."
nam.31.da:0 "German Namibians are a minority among normal Namibians, which migrated here when the German came into control in the 1880s. Unexpectedly, German Namibians have merged well with the Namibian culture and have even formed their own subculture among normal Namibians. However, the current monarchy holds a strong grudge against German colonialism from the past uprisings against German rule and the many purges of the Namibian population."
nam.31.a:0 "German-Namibians are an imperialist construct"
nam.31.b:0 "We'll have revenge for the past"
nam.31.c:0 "They are culturally Namibian, they can stay"

nam.32.t:0 "German Namibians Resist Exportation"
nam.32.d:0 "With the official announcement of the deportation of German Namibians, we have already been met with fierce resistance. The Germans have protested in the streets that have not been gathered up yet with signs stating 'Auch wir sind Namibier!' meaning 'We are Namibians too!'. Some consider continuing or implementing harsher policies on the population to make them stop, while others suggest giving up on the project altogether."
nam.32.a:0 "Continue as normal"
nam.32.b:0 "Put those who resist at the end of our gun"
nam.32.c:0 "Maybe we should let them stay..."

nam.33.t:0 "The Germans Revolt!"
nam.33.s:0 "With our decision to react hostile to the German protests, the resistance has only grown larger, with even our own population going against us in some areas. While our guards are doing well in suppressing the areas, it has made the people lose confidence in our government."
nam.33.ns:0 "Our decision to let the protests continue has resulted in the German population in the south revolting against our government, but has failed to gain popular traction within the rest of Namibia. however, as long as this revolt continues, we can expect to have delays in the deportation process."
nam.33.a:0 "We'll have to wait it out"
nam.33.b:0 "They're leaving, by force if neccasary"

nam.34.t:0 "The German Revolt Ends"
nam.34.d:0 "Due to our efforts, the German revolt has officially come to an end. The fact that it happened in the first place is less than desirable, with many lives being unnecessarily lost on both sides in the process. The Germans have begun to pack up their bags and are being exported. Hopefully Namibia won't have a problem like this anytime into the future."
nam.34.a:0 "Surely this could've been handled better"
nam.34.b:0 "They've learned their lesson"

nam.35.t:0 "The Germans Leave Africa"
nam.35.d:0 "With the revolt over and the situation calmed, the German 'Namibians' have finally left our home. The exportation was a sad time for many Namibians who got close to the Germans, and is still left a highly unpopular decision among our government. We'll need to deal with the consequences of this into the future, for the rest of Namibia's existence."
nam.35.a:0 "Peace at last"

nam.36.t:0 "The First Namibian Elections"
nam.36.d:0 "With Namibia recently being liberated from German rule and put under a Democratic mandate, the conditions are right to host the First Namibian Elections. There are four main parties running, the Republikanische Partei which focuses on more right for the native tribes in the area, the Otavi Minen und Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft which wants to build more railways within Namibia, the Südwestafrikanischer Nationalverein which argues for consolidation in the country and largely removing tribal rule, and the Südwestafrikanische Volksorganisation, an Ovambo based party which wants greater cooperation between tribes and an increase of Christian morals. All these parties have a chance of winning, but the party which came out on top is..."
nam.36.a:0 "The Südwestafrikanische Volksorganisation"
nam.36.b:0 "The Südwestafrikanische Nationalverein"
nam.36.c:0 "The Otavi Minen und Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft Verwaitung"
nam.36.e:0 "The native Republikanische Partei"

nam.37.t:0 "[From.GetName] Requests Guns"
nam.37.d:0 "[From.GetName] due to it's small industry and population is trying to build up an army to defend itself in order to not inconvenience us. They request 2000 guns in order to build up this force, and promise to not bother us again after this."
nam.37.a:0 "Give them what they need"
nam.37.b:0 "We have our own military to worry about"

nam.38.t:0 "[From.GetName] Supplies Arrives!"
nam.38.sent:0 "[From.GetName] has been very generous and sent us what we desired! We have gotten a shipment of 2000 rifles, which is more than enough to build up our military."
nam.38.nosend:0 "[From.GetName] has realized that defending their country takes priority over defending their autonomies. We'll have to rely on the local guards we raised earlier to defend our country."
nam.38.a:0 "We must thank [From.GetName]"
nam.38.b:0 "That is a shame..."
