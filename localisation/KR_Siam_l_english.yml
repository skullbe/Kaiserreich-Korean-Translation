### Leaders ###
# Mahidol Line
POLITICS_RAMA_VII_DESC:0 "Prajadhipok, also known by his regnal name Rama VII, was enthroned as King of Siam upon the death of his brother in 1925. Unprepared for kingship, having previously been far down the order of succession, he is essentially a puppet of the Siamese Council of State run by his cousins. Educated abroad and commissioned in the British Army, Prajadhipok nonetheless genuinely cares for his people and works diligently to improve his subjects' lot." # Prajadhipok
POLITICS_RAMA_VIII_DESC:0 "Ananda Mahidol, known by his regnal name Rama VIII, has ascended to the Siamese throne following the death of his uncle, Rama VII. Ananda Mahidol was once considered a very unlikely candidate for the throne, being barely a teenager and of low birth. He originally held the rank of 'Mom Chao', making him among the lowest of Siamese princes. Despite his youth and inexperience, he has quickly won the hearts of the Thai people. Foreign observers, however, believe that he did not really want to be king that his reign would not last long. " # Ananda Mahidol
POLITICS_RAMA_VIX_DESC:0 "Bhumibol Adulyadej, known by his regnal name Rama IX has ascended to the Siamese throne following the mysterious death of his late brother, Rama VIII. Bhumibol Adulyadej has so far proven himself much more politically competent than his late brother, navigating the convoluted Siamese political landscape with seeming ease. Many speak of Bhumibol Adulyadej as the savior of the once embattled Siamese monarchy" # Bhumibol Adulyadej
# Paribatra Line
POLITICS_SUKHUMBHAND_DESC:0 "Paribatra Sukhumbhand, cousin to expected successor to the Siamese throne Ananda Mahidol, has seized control of the Siamese government, citing Ananda's inexperience and his age. With the full support of the Privy Council he has crowned himself as King Rama VIII, firmly establishing the Boripatr cadet branch as the new ruling house." # Paribatra Sukhumbhand
POLITICS_CHUMBHOTBONGS_PARIBATRA_DESC:0 "Chumbhotbongs Paribatra, known by his regnal name Rama IX, has succeeded his father, Rama VIII, to the throne of Siam. Chumbhotbongs Paribatra is something of a recluse, but still politically competent. He is a known patron of the arts, having converted multiple state-owned properties into museums, and has personally sponsored many great artists both in Siam and abroad." # Chumbhotbongs Paribatra
POLITICS_SUKHUMABHININDA_DESC:0 "Sukhumbhinanda, son of former King Paribatra Sukhumbhand (Rama VIII) and a lowborn woman, was legitimised by his brother King Rama IX due to the latter's inability to produce a male heir. He has ascended to the throne as Rama X. Sukhumbhinanda is a prominent philanthropist whose efforts to relieve Bangkok's poorest have garnered him much publicity. With Sukhumbhinanda's ascension much of the remaining public discontent with the monarchy has dissipated."
# Chrakrabongse Line
POLITICS_CHULA_CHAKRABONGSE_DESC:0 "Chula Chakrabongse, the half-Ukrainian grandson of King Rama V, has been installed as king of Siam. Chula Chakrabongse lived an eccentric life of leisure in Britain and later Austria before becoming king, and has delegated nearly all of his royal duties in favour of his passion for both horse and automobile racing."
# Left
POLITICS_SONG_NOPPAKUL_DESC:0 "Song Noppakul, also known by his real name Prasong Wongwiwat and 'Comrade Ba', is a Thai-Chinese man who co-founded the underground Syndicalist movement within Siam. Following the death of Pichit na Sukothai he became its de-facto leader."# Song Noppakul the Totalist
POLITICS_PRIDI_PANOMYONG_DESC:0 "Pridi Phanomyong, also known by his ministerial title 'Luang Praditmanutham', immediately set out to better the lives of the Siamese people upon his appointment as a minister. His controversial 'Yellow Cover Dossier' outlined his political and economic reform agenda and divided the Siamese government, but the controversy only served to further Pridi's political career." # Pridi Phanomyong at the onset of the CW
POLITICS_PRIDI_PANOMYONG_REBEL_WIN_DESC:0 "Pridi Phanmoyong, previously known by his ministerial title Luang Praditmanutham, has become the Chairman of the Sapha Prachachon following a brief but bloodly Siamese Civil War. Panomyong's policies of economic nationalisation and radical parliamentarian reform may now continue, however challenges from more radical elements within Pridi's Sahachip Party have grown significannotly. Despite his popularity, Panomyong struggles to maintain his authority even with his allies in the Navy." # Pridi Phanomyong after winning his rebellion
# Right
POLITICS_PLAEK_KHITTASANGKHA_DESC:0 "Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram, more popularly known as 'Chormpon Por' by the Thais and 'Phibun' in the West, the one-time ally of Pridi Phanmoyong and the People's Party has seized power following the Yellow Cover Dossier Affair. Together with Luang Wichitwathakarn and his allies in the military he has built his own cult of personality to sideline the Monarchy. He views the current state of Siam as an 'outdated relic of a bygone era' and intends to use his power to promote militarism and nationalism, proclaiming both to be additional essential principles of the modern nation." # Plaek Phibunsongkhram after Coup d’état
POLITICS_PHAO_SRIYANOND_DESC:0 "Police Chief Phao Sriyanond has succeeded Plaek Phibunsongkhram as leader of Siam's military regime with the support of the Soi Ratchakhru Clique. Phao is known for his brutality and political cunning, and his political opponents tend to 'disappear'. Phao also believes the Siamese monarchy to be an antiquated relic which impairs the cause of nationalism, and is thus an avowed Republican" # Phao Sriyanond
POLITICS_SARIT_THANARAT_DESC:0 "General Sarit Thanarat has succeeded Plaek Phibunsongkhram as leader of Siam's military regime with the support of the Sisao Thawaet Clique. Originally a lowly officer in the Phayap Army, he quickly rose through the ranks with Plaek and Phin's help. An ardent anti-Syndicalist, he views the Monarchy as an important tool against the reds and as the focal point of Thai Nationalism." # Sarit Thanarat

siam.13.d:0 "King Prajadhipok of the [SIA.GetName], also known as Rama VII—the 7th monarch of the House of Chakri—has died this morning due to a heart failure. The childless monarch will be succeeded by his nephew, Ananda Mahidol, who has taken the regnal name Rama VIII."
siam.13.d.plaek:0 "King Prajadhipok of the [SIA.GetName], also known as Rama VII—the 7th monarch of the House of Chakri—has died this morning due to pneumonia during his time in exile. The childless monarch will be succeeded by his nephew Ananda Mahidol, who has taken on the regnal name Rama VIII."
siam.13.d.rep:0 "Prajadhipok Sakdidej na Ayutthaya, formerly King Prajadhipok of the [SIA.GetName], also known as Rama VII—the 7th monarch of the House of Chakri—has died this morning due to pneumonia during his time in exile. The childless monarch will be succeeded by his nephew Ananda Mahidol na Ayutthaya, who has taken on the regnal name Rama VIII as the pretender to the Siamese throne."
siam.13.a:0 "May he rest in peace."

siam.14.t:0 "Paribatra Sukhumbhand's Scheme" # Boripatr (?)
siam.14.d:0 "The new king is still young and currently away from home, studying in Switzerland. Should we take the initiative and quickly seize the throne and title of King of Siam for ourselves? After all, we can't count on him to lead us through the war."
siam.14.a:0 "The throne is vacant for us."
siam.14.b:0 "We should stay true to the rightful king."

siam.15.t:0 "라마 8세의 승하" # Mahidol
siam.15.d:0 "King Ananda Mahidol of the [SIA.GetName], also known as Rama VIII—the 8th monarch of the House of Chakri—was found in his bed, shot dead. Although at first thought to have been an accident his death was ruled a murder by medical examiners and three royal pages were later executed following irregular and rushed trials. The mysterious circumstances surrounding his death have been the subject of much controversy. The childless monarch will be succeeded by his brother Bhumibol Adulyadej, who has taken the regnal name Rama IX."
siam.15.d.plaek:0 "King Ananda Mahidol of the [SIA.GetName], also known as Rama VIII-the 8th monarch of the House of Chakri—has died from severe blood loss resulting from a severed radial artery after he crashed his car.

siam.33.d:0 "King Paribatra Sukhumbhand of the [SIA.GetName], also known as Rama IX—the 9th monarch of the House of Chakri—had suffered a heart attack last night while walking around his bedroom in the Grand Palace.

## Introduction Events ##
siamn.1.t:0 "1936년의 시암 왕국"
siamn.1.d:0 "One of the countries that benefited from German victory during the Weltkrieg, Siam regained most of its former land which had previously been lost to the western imperialists. While Siam's relationship with the Huns is, in general, cordial, the fact that they thwarted her expansionist ambitions during the 1929 Intervention in Burma has strained diplomatic and military ties between the two. If Siam should reconcile with the Germans or align itself with others powers is a matter to be decided in the coming decade."
siamn.1.a:0 "흥미롭군, 계속 말해봐라!"
siamn.1.b:0 "나는 전반적인 상황을 잘 알고 있다."

siamn.2.t:0 "정치적 상황"
siamn.2.d:0 "Ever since the coronation of King Rama VII in 1925 most, if not all, of the policies set forth by Siam have been dictated by the Aphiratthamontri Sapha (Council of State). This is a council made up of the King's older siblings, who have continually worked to consolidate their power while keeping the power of the king over the nation weak. Despite promising the [SIA.GetAdjective] intelligentsia that a codified constitution would be issued any reform has been tough to pass, as it would be against the interests of the nobility.\n\nSurrounded by enemies, such as the the Konbaung dynasty to the west, Yunnanese bandits to the north, and the German imperialists to the east, Siam is in a dire situation. It will either perish, forever confined to the pages of a history book, or shall reform itself and emerge a modern state, be it by negotiation or through the use of force."
siamn.2.a:0 "이 불쌍한 왕에게 동정심마저 들 지경이다..."

siamn.3.t:0 "왕국의 여러가지의 많은 문제들"
siamn.3.d:0 "While seemingly economically and industrially prosperous to outside eyes, Siam is actually very reliant on investments made by Germany and must cherish the economic ties it shares with the nation. Industry is a very fragile and small section of the economy, which is mainly built around rice, sugar, and timber exports. Nationalism among ethnic minorities has been rising, which raises the spectre of separatist movements in the near future. On top of all this: the bloated bureaucratic system, which has been present since the reign of Rama VI, has siphoned off much needed taxes and thus allowed for bandits to continually run wild in the fringes of Siam."
siamn.3.a:0 "차라리 필리핀이 더 낫겠는데."

## Black Monday and Early political chaos # Max Reform 7 - Lowest 0: 0-2 = Khana Ratsadon coup, 3-4 = Civil War with Prajadhipok Bias (based on Boworadet Rebellion), 5-6 = success, 7 = Reactionary coup with Paribatra as HoS
siamn.4.t:0 "검은 월요일이 시암에 끼치다!"
siamn.4.d:0 "Due to its heavy reliance on its economic ties with Germany Black Monday has quickly dragged Siam into an economic abyss as demand for her main agricultural exports has fallen sharply and shipments have been left to wither in their warehouses. Clerks working for foreign companies are continually being laid off, while the people have begun to gather around the Grand Palace looking for hope. It is apparent that we must do something about our economic situation lest it worsen and send us spiraling further down."
siamn.4.a:0 "제기랄!"

siamn.5.t:0 "재스민 쌀 문제"
siamn.5.d:0 "One of the largest exporters of rice within Siam, the farmers across the Chao Phraya, have asked for government intervention to deal with the excessive supply of rice due to a general fall in demand and fewer export opportunities after Black Monday."
siamn.5.a:0 "가격 안정화를 위해 대부분의 쌀을 구매한다." #-200, +2 reform

siamn.5.c:0 "자유시장이 이 문제를 해결할 것이다!" #0, 0 reform

siamn.6.t:0 "비대한 관료체계"
siamn.6.d:0 "The modern bureaucratic system was formed during the reign of Rama V and had been greatly expanded by Rama VI. However, it has proved to be too large to effectively serve the state. Firing more people, however, would mean an increase in the unemployment rate at exactly the time when we want it to drop."
siamn.6.a:0 "몇몇의 일부 관료들을 해고하게 한다." # 0 reform
siamn.6.b:0 "관리자와 장관을 해고하게 한다." #-100, +1 reform
siamn.6.c:0 "당장은 현상 유지케한다." #-200, +2 reform

siamn.7.t:0 "군비 지출"
siamn.7.d:0 "Siam currently spends up to 25% of her annual revenue on the preservation and maintenance of the military-industrial complex, as she is surrounded by both historical enemies and imperialistic westerners who desire her land. However perhaps slightly cutting our military expenditures wouldn't hurt us too much?"
siamn.7.a:0 "모든 연구지원 자금을 중단한다." #-10 for 3 years, 0 reform
siamn.7.b:0 "신식 소총의 개발을 전부 중단한다." #-10 for 3 years, +1 reform
siamn.7.c:0 "우린 어떤 약점도 보여서는 안된다!" #-200, +2 reform

siamn.8.t:0 "긴급세"
siamn.8.d:0 "Even though we've enacted many sweeping reforms we still do not have enough money to sufficiently balance this year's budget. An emergency tax should help remedy this situation, but will create more suffering for our loyal subjects."
siamn.8.a:0 "소득세율을 올려라!" #+50, 0 reform
siamn.8.b:0 "상속세를 두 배로 올려라!" #+10, +1 reform
siamn.8.c:0 "도박의 제한을 금지한다" #+30, -5 NP, +1 reform

## New Governmnet Established for Siam ##
siamn.10.t:0 "카나 랏싸던(인민당)의 임시정부"
siamn.10.d:0 "Following the bloodless revolution we must rebuild the nation from the ground up. Luang Praditmanutham, head of the civilian faction of the provisional government and a prominent leftist, is now working on the creation of a formal constitution while others are beginning to educate the masses about the merits and workings of parliamentary democracy. Alongside all of this Phraya Phahonponpayuhasena has readied his troops, in case of an opportunistic invasion by foreign powers."
siamn.10.a:0 "이것은 시암에게는 커다란 도약이다!"

siamn.11.t:0 "인민위원회의 임시정부"
siamn.11.d:0 "Following the ratification of the constitution the People's Committee, a group chosen by Prajadhipok himself, has begun the education of the masses in the ways of proper parliamentary democracy.\n\nHeaded by the [SIA.GetAdjective] Court, the Committee is also responsible for educational, health, and industrialisation reforms. The path ahead for Siam will hardly be a stroll in the park but a bright future does await our great nation."

siamn.12.d:0 "Today Luang Praditmanutham, Minister of State and a member of the People's Party, presented the draft of his "National Economic Development Plan" proposal to the National Assembly.\n\nKnown as the "Yellow Cover Dossier" the plan details the formation of a welfare state, redistribution of land, state intervention in the private sector, and a system of subsidies for farmers.\n\nSome have compared the proposal to that of a syndicalist while others have agreed that the reforms will greatly improve the lives of the [SIA.GetAdjective] people.\n\nAll that remains is to see what his majesty has to say..."

siamn.14.t:0 "국내의 긴장상태"
siamn.14.d:0 "Thawan Ritthidet, a private citizen, has recently filed a lawsuit against the King; accusing him of intervention in political, state, and economic affairs.

### Agricultural Path ###
SIA_agriculuralmechanisation:0 "농업 기계화"
SIA_agriculuralmechanisation_desc:0 "Rice paddy uses over half of the arable land in [SIA.GetName], yet it consists mainly of peasants farming small areas and producing modest amounts of rice. By providing cheap, low-interest loans for the purchase of tractors and modern equipment we can free some of these farmers from the ricefields and send them to the factories instead, without compromising crop yields."
SIA_agrarianscoop:0 "농업 협업체"
SIA_agrarianscoop_desc:0 "While the first [SIA.GetAdjective] co-op was created back in 1916, co-ops themselves aren't a common sight among rural communities yet. By persuading rice farmers to pool their savings together and organize into co-ops they will have enough money to buy the badly needed farming equipment in these hard times, and obtain greater bargaining power against the rice merchants."

SIA_communalapproach_desc:0 "Rice is central to [SIA.GetAdjective] society. As a nation we have long relatively self-sufficient, resistant to government intervention and egalitarian.

SIA_exportrice:0 "수출지향적 쌀 생산"
SIA_exportrice_desc:0 "Rice is central to [SIA.GetAdjective] society. Rice production normally does not ammount to much more than the farmer needs to survive, leaving very little to profit from. If necessary we can colaborate with large rice merchants and mills to supply a market pressure for more production, or we can simply obligate the farmers to produce more by increasing their rice tax."
SIA_ricesubsidyscheme:0 "쌀 농업 보조금 제도"
SIA_ricesubsidyscheme_desc:0 "By creating incentives for those farmers who have accomplished huge increases in their rice output and allowing peasants to own the land they've cleared for agricultural purposes we can provide simple market incentives to cultivate more land and increase crop yields."

SIA_armyaffairs_desc:0 "Our army currently uses various rifle and artillery models, which has proved to be a logistical nightmare.

SIA_royalmunitionsfactory_desc:0 "Having enemies on all sides, Siam nearly used up all her artillery shells during the Weltkrieg, with no means of being freshly supplied.

SIA_industrialmobilization:0 "산업 동원 계획"

### Navy Path ###
SIA_royalsiamesenavy:0 "시암 왕립 해군"
SIA_royalsiamesenavy_desc:0 "Established in 1887, the RSN has similar organisational structures to the United States Navy, since it is composed of both the naval fleet and the Royal Siamese Marine Corps. It was also the second Asian nation to acquire submarines, after Japan."

SIA_expandmarinescorps_desc:0 "Although 'Taharn Ma-Rine' were first founded back in 1833, the unit served mostly as a royal honor guard throughout the 19th century. It wasn't until 1913 that the Siamese Marines were reorganized into the modern "Navy Amphibious Assault Group" who saw some action back in the Weltkrieg. Perhaps the marines can serve as yet another ace in the hole for the upcoming conflict?"
SIA_improvedlandingcraft:0 "Improved Landing Craft"

While we have procurred four small submarines for the first line of defence; continuing the second phase of the plan, which entails another 5 submarines for the outer defensive line, might be a good idea."
SIA_twooceannavy:0 "A Two-Ocean Navy"
SIA_twooceannavy_desc:0 "Our navy is perhaps too small to face the Kaiserliche Marine or the IJN head-on. Some additional funding would definitely help."
SIA_expandsattahip:0 "Expand Sattahip"
