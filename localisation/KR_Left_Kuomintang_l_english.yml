### Leaders ###
POLITICS_CHI_SONG_QINGLING_DESC:0 "Song Qingling was the third and final wife of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, the founder and ideological center of the Kuomintang party. After the failure of the Northern Expedition, Song decided to stay in China as an outlaw in southern Fujian out of a strong feeling of patriotism. Despite her lack of initial credentials aside from marriage ties, she has proven herself to be an inspirational leader to the Insurgent Zone and has become the head of the pro-democratization Minquan Faction."
POLITICS_CHI_WANG_JINGWEI_DESC:0 "Wang Jingwei is a divisive figure within the KMT that has nevertheless maintained his control over the party leadership for over a decade. His rise to national prominence started shortly before the Xinhai Revolution in 1910 when he failed to assassinate the Qing Regent Zaifeng (Puyi's father), but became a sensationalized revolutionary hero while in captivity.\n\nAfter the Xinhai Revolution, Wang was released and his radical political writings became more famous. Though refusing to sign an oath of personal loyalty to Sun Yat-Sen after his refounding of the KMT, Wang would later become a member and a prominent official in the Guangdong government. Aligning himself with the growing left-radical factions of the KMT and the army’s ‘New Guard’, Wang outmaneuvered Hu Hanmin in 1925 to become Sun Yat-Sen’s successor.\n\nShortly afterwards, the Northern Expedition and the German Intervention shattered the Guangdong Government. Wang and the other radicals were immediately attacked by Sun Fo and other moderates for the failures of the expedition, but his control over party positions and personal alliances prevented his deposition.\nWang survives to this day by these factors, but he is highly aware that his future leadership rests on what happens in the next attempt at revolution.\n\nIn terms of personality, Wang Jingwei is a flamboyant, blustery character who is a natural orator. His penchant for wearing military uniforms when acting in a position as Commander-In-Chief makes many of his opponents see him as megalomaniacal, but he usually lets actual officers take the lead when it comes to military decisions. His insistence at maintaining an alliance with the Syndicalist powers is only surpassed by his desire to avoid another intervention by Germany or Japan at all costs until China is unified and ready to fight them."
POLITICS_CHI_SUN_FO_DESC:0 "The eldest son of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, Sun Fo has been a constant presence within the Kuomintang, though not always a prominent or powerful one. While respected because of his father, Sun Fo is not a charismatic or exceptional person himself. The centrist factions in the KMT that have come to be represented by him rely on his familial name and his 'iron neck' to keep their criticisms of the Minsheng program represented within the party's discourse. With control of the Nationalist Government returned to its moderate factions, Sun Fo is in the unenviable position of both having to reconcile with non-syndicalist powers while scaling back the social aspects of the National Revolution."
POLITICS_CHI_CHEN_DUXIU_DESC:0 "Chen Duxiu is an odd figure in the Kuomintang, as he is both an insider and outside to the party itself. While a member of the KMT, Chen is also the chairman of the Chinese Syndicalist Party, a heretofore minor player even within the syndicalist politics of urban China. The previous status of the CSP as a "junior partner" in the Nationalist Revolution makes Chen's unlikely election a strain on the Nationalist Government's previous synonymity with the KMT. A prominent intellectual and Xinhai- era revolutionary, Chen's anti-traditionalist bent and background in Marxist theory colors his views of the future development of China."
POLITICS_CHI_HU_ZONGNAN_DESC:0 "Hu Zongnan was one of Chiang Kai-Shek's most trusted protegés and an exemplary young commander during the Northern Expedition. After the German Intervention, Hu's distrust of the dominant civilian factions and close friendship with Dai Chunfeng led him to resent the politically-motivated meddling by the Left KMT's leadership in matters of war. Hu's ties to both the NRA and the ZhongTeJu made him a critical figure in the growth of the bureau and the later success of Dai's coup against the civilian government. Because of his political indispensability and loyalty, Hu was appointed as Acting President for the duration of the \"state of emergency\" that Dai Chunfeng and the ZhongTeJu now govern through. While not an especially charismatic or skilled politican, he and Dai are close friends and his prominence ensures that the army maintains loyalty to the current regime."
POLITICS_CHI_FANG_ZHIMIN_DESC:0 "One of the most prominent politicians and militia commanders of the JiangFu Insurgency Zone, Fang Zhimin was a Jiangxi native and activist that became a close aide of Song Qingling both in civil and military affairs. His aggressive and dogmatic approach to furthering the Nationalist Revolution led him to first become allied with the Minsheng faction, and later the Chinese Syndicalist Party. The previous status of the CSP as a "junior partner" in the Nationalist Revolution makes Chen's unlikely election a strain on the Nationalist Government's previous synonymity with the KMT. Fang is a dogmatic and charismatic leader who acts as an shaky bridge between the growing radical syndicalist movement and the order established by the KMT."
POLITICS_CHI_DAI_CHUNFENG_DESC:0 "The notorious 'Hooded Chairman' of the KMT, Dai Chunfeng rose to power first as a minor protegé of the late Marshal Chiang Kai-Shek, and then through his leadership of the ZhongTeJu. Devoted to a very personal interpretation of the Kuomintang's mission to unify and revive China, Dai and his allies siezed control of the Nationalist government after a long-standing period of instability made it clear that there was no alternative but the KMT's security apparatus taking the helm of state. As shy of the public spotlight as he is ruthless, Dai is very rarely seen in public, but is known to be an indulgent playboy of a kind when off-duty."
POLITICS_CHI_ZHOU_ENLAI_DESC:0 "Despite his unassuming work in the background over the years, Zhou Enlai is an exceptional politician and statesman. Born into a prominent family of clerks, Zhou was educated at westernized schools in both China, France, and Japan. After becoming radicalized by the revolutionary ideals of the early 1920s, Zhou joined the KMT and rapidly rose in its ranks upon merit, eventually becoming its chief foreign minister in the mid 1930s.\nA prominent member of the Minsheng faction, Zhou has also been integral in maintaining good relations between the KMT party and its military wings, especially as the Nationalists continue their reorganization into a proper nation-state."

POLITICS_CHI_Li_JISHEN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nNovember 6th, 1885\nWuzhou, Guangxi, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nFavored by Guangzhou government before the dawn of the Northern Expedition, Li Jishen became the Chief of General Staff, and was in charge of KMT organs, administrations as well as the military in the whole province of Guangdong. When the Expedition failed, he abandoned Guangzhou, forced to leave for the 4th Army, which was under his direct command. Facing him was a series malicious accusations by other officers, as well as his own subordinates, who blamed on him for not securing Guangzhou. Li retained his position in the Central Committee as several of his detractors went into exile abroad with their misgivings towards him alive and well. Despite his efforts to aid the leftist cadres and commanders trying to escape to the Commune of France, he was still being isolated and nominally assigned as the Chief of Army Staff in China. Inspired by agrarian movements and supported by Soong Ching-ling and Deng Yanda, he gathered the remnant of his forces, establishing Jiangxi-Fujian guerilla zone. Li, being assigned as the Commander in Chief by the Central Committee, is currently following Wang Jingwei’s order to rally exiled veterans for another insurrection. While waiting for a new revolution, Li is studying the Weltkrieg-era strategies and tactics."
POLITICS_CHI_CHENG_QIAN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nMarch 31st, 1882\nLiling, Hunan, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nAs a veteran revolutionary, Chen Qian’s seniority made him one of top commanders of troops belonging to the central committee of KMT. More conservative than some of his peers, Chen partially approved of the switch towards guerrilla tactics proposed by Li Jishen after the failure of the Northern Expedition. He's still considered to be a respectable officer with significant support in Hunan, which could be used by the KMT to improve the chances of their next revolution and open the door to more opportunities in the future."
POLITICS_CHI_XUE_YUE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nDecember 27th, 1896\nShaoguan, Guangdong, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nXue Yue joined the Revolutionary Party has been a firm believer in Dr. Sun's revolutionary ideals ever since. After the failure of the Northern Expedition, Xue Yue was relegated to rear guard actions several times as his tendency towards more right-wing views made him distrusted with some of his peers. Despite this, he always performed his duties well and would later rendezvous with the main forces. After being forced into exile along with several members of the Central Committee he was appointed to the Bharatiya Commune as an attache. Unhappy with this post so far from home, he repeatedly tried to gain permission to return to China to rejoin the revolutionary struggle."
POLITICS_CHI_DENG_YANDA_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nMarch 1st, 1895\nHuizhou, Guangdong, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nAfter the establishment of the Whampoa Military Academy, Deng Yanda served as a minister among them. Later, because of the discord between his political ideas and Chiang Kai-shek's, Deng Yanda volunteered to study in France. During his time there, he heard the news of Sun Yat-sen's death. He worked hard and returned home to participate in the Northern Expedition after completing his studies in advance. After the failure of the Northern Expedition however, Deng Yanda decided to cooperate with Wang Ching-wei. After some discussions between the two, Wang Ching-wei went into exile while Deng Yanda stayed in China, and then he helped Li Jishen create the Jiangxi-Fujian guerrilla zone to resist and began to plan for the next revolution."
POLITICS_CHI_ZHANG_FAKUI_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nSeptember 2nd, 1896\nShaoguan, Guangdong, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nZhang Fakui is fiercely loyal to Sun's revolutionary ideals. He commanded the 4th "Iron" Army during the Northern Expedition, but was discontent with the leadership of Li Jishen's leadership after its failure. Knowing that the revolutionary cause was bigger than one man, he remained his loyal to the left KMT government. However, he fell into the internal party conflicts which ended up making his views become more right-wing, earning him a reputation as one of the most right-wing officeersin the KMT officer corps. He later left for the Commune of France and would then become an attache in the Bharatiya Commune with Xue Yue. He has extensive ties and connections to the DVQDD and he is actively training both Indochinese rebels as well as his own forces."
POLITICS_CHI_YE_TING_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nSeptember 10th, 1896\nHuizhou, Guangdong, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nYe Ting began his military career by fighting against China's many warlords in several battles. He would later study in the Commune of France where he was influenced by Syndicalist thought and ended up joining the Chinese Syndicalist Party after returning China. Back in the homeland, Ye earned a great reputation for his victory in the Battle of the Ting Si Bridge. Due to the eventual failure of the Northern Expedition, Ye had to retreat to the south with the Nationalist Government. Facing such a dire situation, Ye volunteered to lead the NRA in the Jiangxi-Fujian Guerrilla Zone with Li Jishen. Ye is also one of the few Chinese generals interested in air forces."
POLITICS_CHI_LIN_BIAO_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nDecember 5th, 1907\nHuanggang, Hubei, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nHaving participated in the anti-imperialist movement as a student, Lin Biao went south to the Whampoa Military Academy after graduating from high school. During his time at the academy, he became fascinated with the ideals of syndicalism. Such a unique act made him famous in that academy and eventually gained the attention of Ye Ting, who decided to give him special care in the future. Though young and favored, he had shown outstanding performance before his graduation. After the defeat in the Northern Expedition, he initially decided to pursue further education abroad according to Ye's suggestions, but he finally followed the party's decision and stayed in China, leading guerrilla forces in the Jiangxi-Fujian Guerrilla Zone."

After that, he was appointed by Song Qingling as KMT's attache of UoB, and he continues his military studies of the UoB's Republican Army's doctrines, hoping to put them to good use in the next revolution.

When the whampoa military academy was founded, Wang Yaowu, who worked in Shanghai, decided to go south to join the revolution immediately.

Wang Yaowu was good at defence, and successfully repelled the attack of Sun Chuanfang's troops on many occasions when the Northern Expedition failed and the LEP forces besieged and suppressed the guerrilla areas. Therefore, there was a saying among the Beiyang troops that "It is better to meet the King of Hell than to see the King Yaowu", a reference to Wang's pronunciation being same as "the King)"."

### Focuses ###
CHI_jiangfu:0 "장푸 임시정부 수립"
CHI_jiangfu_desc:0 "우리의 봉기가 본격화되면서 푸젠의 황야에서 벗어나 우리가 통제하고 있는 지역에 임시 정부를 세울 떄가 왔습니다."
CHI_ruijin_arsenal:0 "'수많은 작업장' 무기고"
CHI_ruijin_arsenal_desc:0 "핵심구역의 중심은 외진 곳이고 거의 산업화되지 않은 곳인데, 이는 우리가 군벌에 대한 적극적인 전투를 함에 따라 문제가 될 것입니다. 우리의 문제를 완화하기 위해서는 보병 장비의 수리 및 교체를 위한 분산적 제조 기초를 구축하는 계획이 마련되어야만 합니다."
CHI_literacy_programs:0 "농촌 문맹퇴치 계획"
CHI_literacy_programs_desc:0 "중국 농촌 인구의 상당수가 교육을 제대로 받지 못해 현대전에 대비한 훈련도 받지 못하고 있습니다. 이러한 문제를 해결하기 위해 성인과 어린이 모두에게 읽고 쓰는 교육을 제공하기 위한 민생 지원 계획이 가능한 한 빨리 시행되어야만 합니다."
CHI_strike_AOG:0 "독일 자본 압류"
CHI_strike_AOG_desc:0 "독일의 강도와 제국주의자들이 지역의 군벌들이 우리나라의 내륙을 학대하고 채취하도록 내버려두는 것에 만족하고 있는 반면, 그들의 위원들은 그들의 '조약항'에서 도박이나 하고 있습니다. 국민당은 더 이상 이 짓거리를 내버려두지 않을 것입니다. AOG가 보유한 모든 자본은 즉시 징수되어야만 하며 외국인의 손에 압류된 토지는 우리가 가져와야만 합니다."
CHI_consolidate_control:0 "통제력 강화"
CHI_consolidate_control_desc:0 "우리의 반란이 재래식 전쟁을 향해 나아가고 있는 가운데, 우리의 통치 방식 또한 바꾸기 시작해야 합니다. 이제 우리가 비밀스러운 시골 정부로서가 아니라 기능적인 국가로서의 기반 지역과 다른 해방된 영토를 통치하기 시작하는 것은 필수적일 것입니다."
CHI_est_navy:0 "해군 주둔군 설립"
CHI_est_navy_desc:0 "국민주의자들은 우리를 우호적인 무역 상대국들과 연결시킬 수 있는 상선과 무장한 호위대를 절실히 필요로 하고 있습니다. 우리 군이 나포한 함선을 재편성하는 것은 시간이 걸리겠지만, 새로운 중국 해군을 창설하는 중요한 단계입니다."
CHI_jiangxi_rail:0 "중국 중앙철도 통제"
CHI_jiangxi_rail_desc:0 "중국 중앙철도는, 저장과 내륙을 연결하는 새로운 철도의 현지 명칭으로, 혁명 초기의 우리 보급선에 매우 중요합니다. 지금까지의 철도는 외국 자본의 요구에 따라 운영되어 왔지만, 우리는 보다 효율적으로 그리고 더 나은 목적을 가지고 이를 운영할 수 있습니다."
CHI_warlord_research_group:0 "추가적인 군사 연구 조직"
CHI_warlord_research_group_desc:0 "우리가 협력하지 않는다면 친국민당 군벌들과의 동맹은 실효성이 없을 것입니다. 이러한 군대들과 기술을 공유하고 권한을 줌으로써, 우리는 우리의 병력과 계획이 그들이 필요로 하는 곳이나 우리가 필요로 하는 곳 어디에서나 작전할 수 있도록 할 수 있습니다."

CHI_provisional_code:0 "임시 법령 도입"
CHI_provisional_code_desc:0 "혁명의 초기 단계 동안, 국민당이 개간한 중국 영토는 후기 민주 공화국이 될 것과는 매우 다른 방식으로 관리되어야만 합니다. 군사작전을 지원하는 것이 우선시되어야 하지만, 중앙위원회도 시민법원의 설립을 시작하고 평화와 안정, 그리고 가장 중요한 세수를 유지하기 위해 낡은 헌법을 다시 도입해야 합니다."
CHI_expropriate_landlords:0 "토지소유권 압수"
CHI_expropriate_landlords_desc:0 "개인 지주들이 중국의 경작 가능한 토지의 대부분을 관리하고 있으며, 검은 월요일의 여파가 중국 경제에 스며들면서, 농민들은 점점 더 높은 토지 임대료에 시달리고 있습니다. 국민당은 토지 임대료를 규제하는 더 복잡한 절차보다는 해방된 지역에서 가장 큰 지주들의 땅을 대신 압류해 농민들에게 돌려줘야만 합니다."
CHI_land_rent_caps:0 "토지임대료 상한제"
CHI_land_rent_caps_desc:0 "개인 지주들이 중국의 경작 가능한 토지의 대부분을 관리하고 있으며, 검은 월요일의 여파가 중국 경제에 스며들면서, 농민들은 점점 더 높은 토지 임대료에 시달리고 있습니다. 국민당은 단순히 토지를 압류하고 재분배하기 보다는 최악의 경기 침체가 농업인들에게 영향을 미치지 않도록 토지 임대료 상한제를 시행해야만 합니다."
CHI_land_tax:0 "토지사용세"
CHI_land_tax_desc:0 "토지사용세의 개념은 전 세계의 진보적인 개혁가들에게 사랑받는 정책이었고, 헨리 조지의 경제 이론과 가장 관련이 있었습니다. 토지이용세는 국민당의 초기부터 당에 의해 만장일치로 승인되었으며, 이러한 법적 시행은 지속적인 수입원과 수동적인 부의 축적 방지 수단을 모두 보장할 것입니다."
CHI_opium_prohibition:0 "아편 금지"
CHI_opium_prohibition_desc:0 "아편은 굴욕의 세기 초부터 중국의 골칫거리였고, 어마어마한 규모의 중국 남동부가 풍토적인 아편 중독으로 고통받고 있습니다. 국가 안보와 자존심의 문제로서, 우리는 아편 생산을 근절할 뿐만 아니라 통제된 영토 내에서의 아편 거래와 소유를 단속해야만 합니다."
CHI_opium_tax:0 "아편무역세"
CHI_opium_tax_desc:0 "아편 중독과 밀매는 중국의 심각한 문제이지만, 우리는 현실적으로 우리 영토 내에서 아편의 생산을 금지하고 밀수를 단속하는 것 이상은 할 수가 없습니다. 합법적인 경로 내에서 판매되는 아편에 대한 과세는 이 악덕이 국가의 국고를 위해 사용될 수 있도록 해줄 것입니다."
CHI_gannan_deal:0 "간난 뉴딜"
CHI_gannan_deal_desc:0 "민권파 내에서는 간난을 향후 중국 발전을 위한 모범 지역으로 만들자는 제안이 나오고 있습니다. 국영 고아원, 무료 진료소, 학교, 공공 주택과 같은 사회 계획은 전쟁으로 피폐해진 중국의 가장 외진 지역에서도 국민주의자들이 모든 시민들의 삶의 질을 향상시키는 데 헌신하고 있다는 것을 세계에 보여줄 수 있을지도 모릅니다."

CHI_yangste_offensive:0 "양쯔 하부로의 공세 준비"
CHI_yangste_offensive_desc:0 "팔성연합은 산산조각 났지만, 그 핵심인 남경 군벌은 여전히 살아남았고 곧 안정을 되찾을지도 모릅니다. 중국 남부의 상황을 개선하기 위해서는 장쑤의 권력 중심부를 공략해야만 합니다. 우리의 비장의 무기는 중특위인데, 그들은 방어에 공작을 펼쳐줄 국민주의자 잔당들을 군벌의 땅에 심어놨습니다."
CHI_contact_cells:0 "국민주의자 잔당 재편"
CHI_contact_cells_desc:0 "중국이 군벌로부터 해방되면서 지하에서 활동하는 당으로서의 국민당의 구조는 무의미해졌습니다. 우리는 현 정부의 관리를 도울 충직하고 유능한 당원이 필요하며, 이 지역의 당원들이 이상적인 후보입니다. 통제하고 있는 지역의 잔당들은 보다 공식적인 정부가 수립될 때까지 지역의 정부 부서로 재편되어야만 합니다."
CHI_handle_SQI:0 "이상주의자 다루기"
CHI_handle_SQI_desc:0 "산둥은 연합 전쟁 덕분에 우리와 직접 접촉하게 되었습니다. 만약 우리가 인민들을 위해 중국을 얻어야 한다면, 이 잠재적인 위협에 대처해야 하며, 이가 남동부로 확산되는 것을 막아야만 합니다."
CHI_VNQDD_liasons:0 "DVQDD 반군과의 연락"
CHI_VNQDD_liasons_desc:0 "DVQDD, 즉 '대월 국민당'은 인도차이나에 있는 우리의 자매 단체이며, 우리처럼 아시아에서 민주적인 반제국주의의 대의에 헌신하고 있습니다. 우리의 국경이 인도차이나 지역과 맞닿게 되면, 우리는 광범위한 인도차이나 정치의 세계 속에서 그들과 더 긴밀하게 협력하고 도울 수 있을 것입니다."
CHI_HNN_intervention:0 "호남 국민당 지원"
CHI_HNN_intervention_desc:0 "호남에 남아 있는 유일한 민주주의는 국민당의 일부 당원들입니다. 하지만, 호남 군벌은 여전히 군벌의 군대에 의해 확고하게 통제되고 있으며, 우리의 혁명은 그곳에서 매우 느리게 발전하고 있습니다. 후난에서의 국민당의 영향력을 확대함으로써, 우리는 더 쉽게 혁명을 일으킬 수 있을 것입니다."
CHI_chen_mingshu_reconcile:0 "양광 국민당 지원"
CHI_chen_mingshu_reconcile_desc:0 "양광 국민당의 대표는 그가 좌파 정치를 선호한다는 점에서 불량한 국민혁명군의 장군들 사이에서는 이상한 존재이지만, 그는 중국 좌파의 보다 권위주의적인 파벌에 전적으로 반대하고 있습니다. 민권 민주 원칙를 지향하는 중앙위원회의 새로운 조정으로, 우리는 협상을 통해 이 지역을 평화적으로 통일할 수 있는 드문 기회를 갖게 되었습니다."
CHI_plan_southern:0 "화남 통합"
CHI_plan_southern_desc:0 "국민당은 두 번째 북방 원정을 시도하기 전에 중국 남부를 통제하거나 평화롭게 만들어야만 합니다. 이를 위해 국가혁명군은 중특위의 첩보 및 특수작전 지원으로 남아 있는 남부의 군벌들에 대한 원정 계획을 세워야만 합니다."
CHI_SZC_intervention:0 "쓰촨 국민당과의 조화"
CHI_SZC_intervention_desc:0 "혼란스러운 쓰촨 정치의 세계에서, 장교단은 국민당에 대해 호의적인 시각을 가진 유일한 단체입니다. 그들의 지방 권력 투쟁에서 장교단을 지원함으로써, 우리는 귀중한 동맹국을 얻을 수 있고, 심지어 그들을 통해 전체 지방을 통제할 수도 있습니다."
CHI_YUN_reconcile:0 "운남 국민당과의 조화"
CHI_YUN_reconcile_desc:0 "북방 원정 이후, 국민당 우파이 통제하던 군대의 잔당들은 운남에서 피난처를 찾았습니다. 최근 운남의 권력투쟁에서 국민당 중도우파의 승리로 우리는 옛 민족주의 정당과 함께 문제를 해결하고 남중국을 통일하여 강력한 전선을 형성할 기회를 갖게 될지도 모릅니다."
CHI_plan_western:0 "서부 원정 계획"
CHI_plan_western_desc:0 "운남과 쓰촨의 서부 지역은 중국의 지배를 위한 투쟁의 부차적인 것처럼 보일지 모르지만, 그들의 충성심과 자원을 확보하는 것이 승패의 차이를 증명할 수 있습니다. 외교적 해결을 위한 다른 길이 없다면, 우리는 서남부의 군벌들에 대한 군사작전에 의지해야 할지도 모릅니다."

CHI_mingshu:0 "천밍수의 승리"
CHI_mingshu_desc:0 "푸젠에서 발발한 국민당의 반란이 실패로 돌아가자, 이제 중국이 국민당의 통치하에 있다는 것을 확실히 하는 것은 천밍수의 몫입니다. 천밍수는 여전히 강력한 상류층이나 상인들과 같은 문제를 겪고 있습니다. 게다가 양광에는 우리가 처리해야만 할 불안이 있습니다."
CHI_National_Plan:0 "국가 계획"
CHI_National_Plan_desc:0 "국가 계획으로 우리는 천중밍의 정부를 이용하여 중국의 통합을 훨씬 더 쉽게 만들 수 있습니다. 이는 그의 정부의 형태가 지방 지도자들에게 더 호소력이 있는 자치권이 있는 미국의 주에 기반을 두고 있기 때문입니다."
CHI_Respect_Chen_Jiongming:0 "광둥 정책 시행"
CHI_Respect_Chen_Jiongming_desc:0 "연합주가 될 수 있는 영토들이 우리의 통제하에 있지만 그렇다고 우리가 천중밍의 유산을 완수할 수 없다는 뜻은 아닙니다. 만약 우리가 그의 이상을 우리에게 맞도록 살짝 조정한다면, 우리는 국민들로부터 많은 부와 지지를 얻을 수 있을 것입니다."

CHI_Consolidate_Liangguang:0 "양광 통합"
CHI_Consolidate_Liangguang_desc:0 "내전 전후로 발생한 긴급한 문제들은 다뤄져야 할 필요가 있습니다. 북방 원정대는 이후 적에게 준비 시간을 더 줄 때까지 기다려야 할 것입니다."
CHI_Manage_Unrest_In_Guangxi:0 "광시 소요 사태 통제"
CHI_Manage_Unrest_In_Guangxi_desc:0 "광시는 연합의 붕괴 이후 중국의 많은 부분을 사로잡고 있는 혼란을 면치 못했습니다. 우리의 새 행정부는 반동분자이든, 도적이든, 일관도 선동가이든 간에 이 지방의 소요 사태에 대처해야만 합니다."

CHI_Gentry_Concession:0 "상류층에게 양보"
CHI_Gentry_Concession_desc:0 "수많은 상류층들은 나쁜 체제의 산물입니다. 우리는 강압적으로 접근을 하는 대신, 양보를 하여 그들의 지지를 얻을 수 있습니다. 우리가 기존의 경제 기반에 큰 차질없이 개혁을 추진할 수 있도록 하는 것은, 매 단계마다 그들과 싸우는 것보다 더 쉬울 것입니다."
