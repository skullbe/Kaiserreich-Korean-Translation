russia.1.d:0 "After the October Revolution Anti-Bolshevik forces started to consolidate across the former Russian Empire, leading to a massive rebellion against the Soviet Republic in Siberia, and the Don and Kuban steppes during the middle of 1918. The White movement made considerable gains, but could not defeat the well placed Red Army, which still dominated the Russian industrial heartland and transportation networks. The war changed when the German Empire, fearing the success of a dangerous ideology, intervened on behalf of the Whites in exchange for recognition of the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. By January 1920, both Moscow and Petrograd had fallen to the White forces and a new Russian Republic was established in the former Imperial capital. For the past fifteen years the leading political parties, the Social Revolutionaries and Kadets, have governed in an uneasy coalition under Kerensky, maintaining their power through electoral manipulation and a lack of serious political opposition. Today Russia is becoming increasingly unstable, and other political forces are growing. They consider that it is now time for change, so that the country may once again assert its power in the world..."

russia.2.t:0 "The Russian Constitution of 1918"
russia.2.d:0 "Signed in 1918, roughly a year after the fall of Nicholas II, the Russian constitution defines the country's political institutions. The legislative branch consists of the State Duma, elected every five years, and the Senate, consisting of senior nobles, statesmen, and scholars. The executive branch is divided into the office of President, elected every six years by the Senate, and the Council of Ministers."

russia.2017.t:0 "The Russian Economy"
russia.2017.d:0 "After the end of the Russian Civil War in early 1920, the Kerensky government attempted to recover the economy using a mix of socialist economic theories and the propositions of the Kadets and its supporters among the Russian capitalists. Kerensky recognised the de-facto redistribution of the land among the Russian peasants and restored private land ownership. Using the gold reserve of the Russian Empire, which during the Civil War was under Kolchak's control and later was transferred to Petrograd, Kerensky introduced a new currency and launched the 'New Economic Policy', NEP, which allowed him to recover the Tsarist industry, including the military plants, and involve American investments in the various branches of the Russian economy. However the slowing growth of the economy as well as the intensification of the confrontation between the right and left parts of the Russian establishment led to the recession in 1933. It is clear that the Russian industry still has great potential, which can strengthen the economy as well as the international position of the country."

The current budget for 1936 is already stretched to a bare minimum, and if we are to pay the accursed Teutons, the cabinet sees no other alternative than imposing harsh austerity measures. The cuts in government spending will be most harshly felt in the social services sector and in the many homes of invalided war veterans depending on the state's support. Our citizens were already disgruntled and dissatisfied with the incumbent coalition of Kadets, the Social Revolutionaries united under the even more unpopular presidency of Alexander Kerensky, and it is feared that these austerity measures will bring still more extreme political groupings unto the political scene."

During the Berlin conference in November 1935 president Alexander Kerensky together with prime minister Pavel Milyukov were forced to accept the premature payment of Brest-Litovsk reparations.

However, he also understands that without an efficient political programme, his control over the country will be lost and the left Social-Revolutionaries will plunge Russia into terror and chaos. The temporary prime-minister, General Lukomskiy, a well-known supporter of Kornilov can maintain a similarity of order, but he has awful relations with almost all republican factions in the Senate and Duma. As a result, Kornilov has decided to invite Boris Savinkov, the leader of 'Narodno-Respublikanskaya Partiya Rossii' (People's Republican Party of Russia), into the government and offer him the post of Prime-Minister. Though Savinkov and Kornilov are not on the best of terms, Kornilov hopes that Savinkov will be able to reconstruct the glory of the Russian state."

russia.37.d:0 "Boris Savinkov, a former terrorist and socialist turned populist and nationalist and protector of the Russian peasants in the Duma, has played a very important role in Russian politics since the end of the civil war. Between the years 1917-1920 he gained control over the rightist part of the Social-Revolutionary Party and renamed it the 'People's Republican Party of Russia', which under his leadership did its best to fight separatism throughout the country, propose radical laws to improve the position of the peasants and support pro-Russian movements in the German satrapies, carved out of the territories of the former Russian Empire by the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. A talented writer, as well as the leader of the Combat Squads in the different Russian cities and towns, Savinkov is ready to accept the role of a Kornilov supporter and to start rebuilding the Russian society on the basis of his ideology of National Renewal."

russia.38.d:0 "During a meeting of the left SRs in Moscow, Maria Spiridonova was assassinated by members of Savinkov's Combat Squads. The liquidation of such a prominent Socialist leader provoked an early and consequently ill-organised rebellion against the government. The rising was easily suppressed by a concert of the police and Combat Squads. Today, General Kornilov published a new law prohibiting the Left SR party and proscribing its leaders. With the flower of its leadership cut down by the scythe of the state, the Social Revolutionaries no longer pose any threat to the Kornilov-Savinkov dyarchy."

The merger was approved by a dubious plebiscite where more than 90 percent of the electorate voted 'Da' (Yes).

Amongst other things, the directive dismissed the Duma whilst outlawing all political parties besides Savinkov's own 'Narodno-Respublikanskaya Partiya Rossii'.

The vast military apparatus of Russia would find someone of his background, character and views to be unacceptable even under the best of circumstances. Failing to restore any semblance of order after the tragic death of Kerensky, it was only a matter of time before his makeshift government began to fall apart. [ROOT.GetLeader] had become despised by the right, was far too much of a socialist to be considered a compromise candidate by the liberals, and was even unable to rally Russia's left due to the utter paralysis of the state.\n\nFearing that [ROOT.GetLeader]'s failing government would crumble and give way to a Bolshevik takeover, several reactionary officers led by Lavr Kornilov made their move at the crack of dawn. Their preparations had been concealed by the chaos that had gripped the nation and thanks to treachery within the army and intelligence services they were able to seize multiple key government buildings and strategic infrastructure in the capital and across the country. In a radio address heard from Smolensk in the west all the way to Kamchatka in the east, Kornilov declared that the age of anarchy was over and that the army had once more come to liberate Russia from the reds.\n\nBy noon, the government swept in after Kerensky's death was no more. [ROOT.GetLeader] was placed under arrest and garrisons in several major cities were rounding up and detaining leftist politicians. While many Russian conservatives and reactionary nationalists alike were cheering on the developments, others watched in horror as Kornilov killed any hope of political reform, let alone a non-violent revolution. No matter how Kornilov acted from here on, there was little doubt to anyone in Russia or abroad that this was the end of the nation's troubles. For now, though, Kornilov and his closest aides had to decide how Russia would be governed after its brief stint with socialism."

Although the Duma managed to maintain the mantle of legislative and executive power, the government's control of the apparatus of state is still unstable. In an attempt to restore popular faith in parliament, Acting President [Root.GetLeader] today held a speech in a packed Duma, stressing the importance of maintaining both order and the civil liberties of all the Russian Republic's citizens."

rusd.51.t:0 "Marshal Vrangel Addresses the Nation"
rusd.51.d:0 "A few days after seizing power, Field marshal Vrangel went forward to address the troubled Russian people. A man of noble birth, Vrangel will do anything to insure the survival of Russia, even if that means letting go of his dreams of a new Romanov monarchy. In his widely publicised speech, the Field marshal declared his intention to maintain order and stability in Russia by any means necessary - even if it means compromising with the more extreme rightist groups."

He has also demanded that the monasteries should benefit from public taxation and that priests should be granted a high salary, paid for by the state. There are even rumours about his support for a restoration of Tsarism, a move that our people are still not ready for!"

As the more localized form of government under the Zemstva allows for local leaders to react more quickly and precisely to the needs of the local citizenry, the new hospital marks a fast response to what could otherwise have turned into a regional health crisis in the wake of our rapid growth. As living standards improve, so too will satisfaction with our government."
rusd.57.d.infrastructure:0 "A local governor in [RUS_zemstvo_state.GetName], appalled by the poor state of the roads in the region, has paid for the construction of new ones out of his own pocket.

More civilian goods are nice, but we're equally concerned with the more pressing matters of state defense."
rusd.57.d.mismanagement:0 "While more decentralized rule has its benefits, the lack of government oversight can sometimes have a negative side as well. We've recently been informed that many factories and companies in [RUS_zemstvo_state.GetName] are poorly run due to gross mismanagement, a situation that unfortunately has flown under the radar for longer than it ought to have. While the governor of the region has stepped in to remedy matters, we're nonetheless left paying the price for not being able to stop this widespread neglect sooner."

[RUS_zemstvo_state.GetName] recently experienced this first-hand when a group of wealthy merchants used their wealth to buy their way into attaining considerable influence over the local Zemstva. With little oversight, they were able to embezzle a good deal of money meant to go to the state's coffers before law enforcement managed to shut their operation down. As their findings seem to indicate that this is merely the tip of the iceberg, however, it seems like we'll be battling this kind of corruption for the foreseeable future..."

Millions of rubles have poured into local companies and the large uptick in economic activity has acted like a magnet for outside investments as well.

Naturally, these riches will inevitably trickle their way upstream to [RUS.GetCapital] as well."

Though some of the socialist ideas are implemented in the ideology of Savinkov's party, the radical syndicalists, who have majority in some Russian regions reject the ideals of the national state. Fortunately for Savinkov, the new government has many loyalists in others circles of Russian society. Old friends of Savinkov, the famous philosopher Dmitriy Merezhkovskiy and his wife Zinaida Gippius have published an appeal to the new leaders of the country. They claim that Russia must be purified from internal enemies, who want to spread chaos and betray the national interests.

Russians should help Russians' - Though the expansionist plans of Savinkov cannot be realised right now, this declaration of unity of the Russian nation, strongly supported by the Vozhd of the Peasants and the Army shows that Russia won't avoid the confrontation with the German Empire anymore."

New Russia needs your help in the restoration of its might. Help your country to make it great once again. Glory to Russia and glory to its heroes. It is your country too' - The new national policy of Russia is based on the idea of the supremacy of the Russian people, but the idea of the friendship among the nations is popular as well. Savinkov has combined these two ideas to secure the interests of the Russians and the minorities, who should be loyal, but are also granted all the rights of citizenship.

Forgotten and unremarkable waste land in the North-East suburbs of Moscow was turned into ideal model of the future of Russia. Facades of the pavilions of the Russian regions showed the strategic meeting of architectural traditions with the arts and crafts of each part of the country together with motives of important collective labour.

rusd.135.d:0 "Though Savinkov and Kornilov have established a dictatorship, disputes between Savinkov's NRPR republicans and Kornilov's young officers can still endanger the cooperation of these two sides of the new regime. It is obvious that the government can't allow the left radicals in the State Duma and the monarchists in the Senate to use these controversies to destroy the rule of the army and the NRPR. To prevent such unwanted events, Savinkov has proposed a recreation of the Supreme Privy Council ('Verkhovnyi Tainyi Sovet'), which once had both executive and legislative power and consisted of a small number of the most important Russian ministers. Membership of the SPC, known as "Verkhovniki", will consist of 3 party members with Savinkov on top along with Kornilov and 3 of his old comrades from the Russian Army.

Yusupov has proposed to create the united civil and military engineering organisation with him on the top, which will use Yusupov's money as a start-up capital. But in exchange for this necessary investment for our country, Felix asks us to make him the new 'Verkhovnik'."

But what we have to do is to be united against this radical Duma, filled with the national-populist and syndicalist fanatics. That's why I ask you to approve my plan of the Russian modernisation. The power of the Senate should be used as the iron fist in a velvet glove' - with these words the former Grand Duke Dmitriy Pavlovich and now the Head of the Senate Dmitriy Romanov demanded an approval of his plan, which is called 'Nashe Delo' ('Our Deal'). According to this program, the powers of the State Duma should be limited, while the Senate will launch the reorganisation of the Russian internal policy and economy. But Dmitriy Pavlovich demands that the Senate should give him an absolute support of every his draft laws."
rusd.140.a:0 "Let it be."

rusd.141.t:0 "Elite Gymnasiums"
rusd.141.d:0 "Each city in the Russian Empire used to have a gymnasium, where the smartest children and the children of the local elite studied. With the republican reforms of Kerensky most of these schools were cancelled and all these students had to study together with the sons and daughters of the workers and peasants. The Senators claim that such elite gymnasiums should be restored to be sure that the best representatives of the next Russian generation will have perfect conditions for study. Otherwise we can support the public schools, though it is clear that they will never reach the level of the old gymnasiums…"
rusd.141.a:0 "Elite gymnasiums for the smartest children!"
rusd.141.b:0 "Public schools for everyone!"

rusd.142.t:0 "Tradition of the Masquerade balls"
rusd.142.d:0 "Masquerade balls were widespread among the Russian nobles and students before the revolution in 1917. With the opening of the new gymnasiums the old tradition was reborn and became very popular and attractive for the students all over the Russian cities and towns, where the Gymnasiums were founded. What is really surprisingly that even some students from the public school try to take part in these balls, using the masks. Let's hope that this nice tradition won't disappear in the future."
rusd.142.a:0 "This youth is beautiful as Russia itself."

rusd.143.t:0 "Mansions of the Aristocrats"
rusd.143.d:0 "The richest people of Russia, who are partially represented in the Senate could take back some of their mansions after the awful land redistribution in the Civil war, but they suffered a lot from the high land taxes of the Kerensky's regime. Though these taxes are really profitable for our economy, but the loyalty of the Senators are highly important for the realisation of the Dmitriy Pavlovich's policy. There is a possible solution of this problem - the mansions of some senators can be secured by the Republic as the historical heritage - it means that the Senators will pay the taxes, but the government will partially invest into the maintenance of these buildings."
rusd.143.a:0 "Let's hope nobody will notice this reform."
rusd.143.b:0 "The senators have enough money, they don't need state investments!"

rusd.144.t:0 "Union of Nicholas II"
rusd.144.d:0 "'Union of the perpetuation of the legacy of the Nicholas II' or just 'Union of Nicholas II' is an organisation, founded by the former tsarist officials such as Pyetr Bark and Vladimir Kokovtsov, who want to keep the remembrance of the last Russian tsar and his policy. They have proposed a program of the events to show the role of Nicholas II for the Russian people all over the country. The Senate point out that we should support this union to establish close connections with the former, but powerful officials. It should allow us to gain some votes of the conservative members of the local and state Dumas."
rusd.144.a:0 "We will remember Nicholas for all his good deeds for Russia."
rusd.144.b:0 "Many people are still republicans - we won't support the Union."

rusd.145.t:0 "Day of Triumph"
rusd.145.d:0 "The Senate, which represents the richest Russian industrialists, the old aristocracy and the Russian Church together with the Grand Duke Dmitriy Pavlovich Romanov, who is the Head of the Senate could finally stop the lasting crisis, which weakened Russia. The Grand Duke, who controls the country with an iron fist in a velvet glove, but also doesn't forget to analyse various propositions of the Senate became the real leader of the Russians and got many new allies even in the State Duma. That's why the Senate unanimously decided to give Dmitriy Romanov the broad powers, which even the last tsar Nicholas II and president Kerensky didn't have. Nothing can stop the Duke from the modernisation of Russia, which will allow the republic to take its place under the Sun!"
rusd.145.a:0 "Long live Dmitriy Pavlovich!"

rusd.146.t:0 "Endless Deadlock"
rusd.146.d:0 "The Senate, which represents the richest Russian industrialists, the old aristocracy and the Russian Church together with the Grand Duke Dmitriy Pavlovich Romanov on the top of the Senate unfortunately couldn't stop the lasting crisis, which weakens Russia. The Grand Duke, who controls the country with an iron fist in a velvet glove, paid no attention to the ideas of this state authority. That's why the majority of the Senate decided to revoke the broad powers, which were given to the Duke one year ago. It seems that Dmitriy Romanov has to fight for the support also against some of the senators."
rusd.146.a:0 "Oh well."

rusd.147.t:0 "Honorary Residents"
rusd.147.d:0 "Though the government of Dmitriy Romanov maintained the republic, but we somehow have to encourage the most important citizens of Russia, including the former aristocrats with the additional rights, strengthening their loyalty and willingness to cooperate with us. That's why President Romanov decides to restore the tradition of the giving the "honorary resident" titles, which will give some privileges to these people in various regions and cities of Russia."
rusd.147.a:0 "That's a good proposition."

rusd.148.t:0 "New Aristocracy"
rusd.148.d:0 "Though the noblemen in the Senate could defeat this terrible republic and restore the Empire, but they had to admit that the support of the new capitalists and industrialists played the significant role in this restoration. That's why it is the perfect time to show them our gratitude - the most powerful representatives of these classes, who helped us to strengthen the power of the Senate will get a title of nobility, which their descendants will be able to get as well."
rusd.148.a:0 "It's good to be a part of the elite!"

rusd.149.t:0 "Martha and Mary Convent of Mercy"
rusd.149.d:0 "In 1908 Grand Duchess Elizaveta Fyodorovna after the murder of her husband gave away her magnificent collection of jewels, including her wedding ring, and sold other possessions to found a Martha and Mary Convent of Mercy in Moscow, which started to assist sick, wounded, and maimed soldiers in their recovery, and to provide for the needs of the poor and orphans. This saint woman, who was killed in 1918 by the Bolsheviks, was de-facto a stepmother of her nephew Dmitriy Pavlovich, who decided to perpetuate her good deeds by making a great contribution into the Convent."
rusd.149.a:0 "It's all for you, Aunt Elizabeth..."

rusd.150.t:0 "'Triumph'"
rusd.150.d:0 "Ryabushinsky's Plant (also known as ZIR) is one of the major Russian automobile manufacturer, which also produced luxury vehicles in very low quantities, primarily for the officials and the other wealthy citizens of Russia. Though Black Monday seriously hurt the factory, the growing power of the aristocracy and businessmen made the market of the luxury vehicles once again very profitable for ZIR. That's why the name 'Triumph' was suggested for the new limousine ZIR-101, which the plant started to produce at the beginning of 1937."
rusd.150.a:0 "Vroom-vroom!"

rusd.151.t:0 "All Quiet in the Senate"
rusd.151.d:0 "The Senate, which represents the richest Russian industrialists, the old aristocracy and the Russian Church together with the Grand Duke Dmitriy Pavlovich Romanov, who is the Head of the Senate could finally stop the lasting crisis, which weakened Russia. Though the problem is that Dmitriy Pavlovich doesn't always pay attention to the advice of the Senate and it often leads to the misunderstanding between the Grand Duke and this important state authority. But there are still good chances that they will find a proper way to negotiate and to recover Russia."
rusd.151.a:0 "We hope so."

rusd.152.t:0 "Dmitriy Pavlovich's New Power"
rusd.152.d:0 "Dmitriy Romanov took power by happy coincidence and isn't going to lose his position. Since he can't control both Duma and Senate, the Grand Duke is in great need of a completely obedient political power. That's why a new party, called 'Indivisible Russia' was created by Felix Yusupov, who has been Dmitriy's friend since childhood. This new party is ready to maintain interests of Russia and its Acting President."
rusd.152.a:0 "This Duma is nothing but a formality!"

rusd.153.t:0 "Dmitriy Romanov Assumes Power"
rusd.153.d:0 "After the death of Kerensky the Winter Palace in Petrograd wasn't vacant for long. Grand Duke Dmitriy Pavlovich Romanov with the help of the old aristocracy and the new financial elite controls the biggest country in the world, as his royal ancestors did before the revolution. Playing the role of the 'good tsar' for the peasantry, Dmitriy Pavlovich guarantees that the new elite will save the property and money of the farmers. As in 1916 when he killed Rasputin, the Grand Duke is ready to act decisively in the name of Russian interests. His appeal to restore Russian glory and might is widely supported by the various layers of the nation. The people await his first actions."
rusd.153.a:0 "This Romanov can really charm!"

rusd.154.t:0 "The Summer Camps of 'Yunarmiya'"
rusd.154.d:0 "One of the most important aims of the 'Yunarmiya' is the formation of the summer camps for the children, where they will be able to spend summer and be involved in the various activities, studying the new ideology of Russia. Our Vozhd proposes that the first camp, called 'Sovyonok' ('Owlet') should be build in the Yekaterinodar region, on the Black Sea coast. It seems to be a perfect place for the Russian children, where they will have fun for three months."
rusd.154.a:0 "They will remember this summer as a long one, maybe even as an everlasting."
rusd.154.b:0 "No, we don't need it."

rusd.155.t:0 "The New Duma?"
rusd.155.d:0 "After Savinkov's rise to power, the lower house of the Russian parliament - State Duma was dissolved. However some members of the Supreme Privy Council propose to reestablish this authority with the limited powers. Besides the People's Republican Party of Russia (NRPR) led by Savinkov, which will definitely have a majority, various business circles as well as the conservative groups and politicians also want to take part in the election, promising that they will support our new state policy, but they also want to represent their interests and help the government to strengthen the Russian economy as well as the army. Though their support can be important for Savinkov, but there is a chance that once they will try to take control over the country..."
rusd.155.a:0 "NRPR is strong, but needs connections in the elite. Start the elections!"
rusd.155.b:0 "We don't need any independent legislators as well as the State Duma itself."

rusd.156.t:0 "The New Duma is elected!"
rusd.156.d:0 "After the elections to the State Duma, Savinkov's NRPR got 73%. The conservative and right parties as well as the movements, led by the representatives of the Russian business and industry got other 27% of the votes. It seems that the new legislators are ready to change Russian laws to improve the situation in the country."
rusd.156.a:0 "Very well."

rusd.157.t:0 "Disfranchisement of the former Bolsheviks"
rusd.157.d:0 "'The whole question of Russia's existence depends on our understanding the true nature of Bolshevism and the nature of its supporters. We have to open our eyes to the fact that Bolshevism is a global threat, not just local Russian disease. That's exactly the reason why we should identify all its supporters and limit their influence to the life of the Russian Republic.' - with these words the main ideologist of the Russian "National Renewal" Dmitriy Merezhkovskiy explained the revocation of the right to vote as well as the part of the other civil rights for the members of the Bolshevik party and some former Soviet officials. With this measure, Boris Savinkov and NRPR are going to improve the situation in the Russian society and get rid of all these elements, who undermine the stability of Russia."
rusd.157.a:0 "You wanted to revoke our rights in 1917, but now you will lose yours."

rusd.158.t:0 "Vox Populi"
rusd.158.d:0 "Boris Kamkov, pre-1917 Savinkov's ally and later one of his main enemies, who had became the leader of the Left SRs after the assassination of Maria Spiridonova, died this night in Moscow. It happened when Savinkov's Combat Squads broke into the house, where an illegal Left SR meeting took place, and Kamkov, trying to escape, jumped in the Moscow River and drowned. According to the famous sarcastic writer Ivan Bunin, the 'vox populi' about this incident seems to be sneers or indifference - just like Savinkov and the NRPR want."
rusd.158.a:0 "Farewell Boris, farewell Boris, I'll see you in my dreams."

rusd.159.t:0 "The Great Crusade"
rusd.159.d:0 "'I'm so delighted with the events of January 1936, with the great heroic deed of the Knight, who raised with his hand the sword to kill the Devil. I believe that this struggle will be continued and our Vozhd will revenge for all these young heroes, who were cowardly killed by the lefts. This struggle must finish with our victory.' - Ivan Shmelyov, Russian conservative writer, whose unarmed son was killed by the Reds at the end of the civil war, demands that Russian government should continue to fight against the left movements, such as Left SRs and Mensheviks not only in Moscow and Petrograd, but also in the various Russian regions. Though these parties were incredibly weakened by special government measures after Savinkov's rise to power and the killing of Maria Spiridonova and Boris Kamkov, their leaders in Russian regions definitely should be arrested and even executed, if necessary."
rusd.159.a:0 "Russia won't be a syndicalist country. Never."

rusd.160.t:0 "Purge them all?"
rusd.160.d:0 "More than 20,000 Bolsheviks, former Soviet officials, members of the Left SR, and Menshevik party members and leaders were arrested during these past few months. 3,000 of them were already sentenced to the death and executed. But more and more people in Russia, including members of the NRPR, demand that the government should end this policy once and for all. Although Savinkov and the Supreme Privy Council have decided to cease the purges, the question still remains: should these 17,000 people be jailed or should they be executed as enemies of the state?"
rusd.160.a:0 "Imprison them - we are not bloodthirsty Syndicalists after all."
rusd.160.b:0 "Without them Russia will be better - purge them all!"

rusd.161.t:0 "Trial of the Left Separatists"
rusd.161.d:0 "After the end of the Russian Civil War, some of the national minorities which fought on the side of the Soviets against the White Army continued to disobey the central government, not only through acts of terrorism, but also using the opportunity to take part in the local legislative authorities, where they often found support among the left movements, such as the Mensheviks and parts of the Left SRs. This movement of local nationalists became famous as the 'Left Separatists'. Though Boris Savinkov has accepted the new national policy, which should regulate and improve the relations between Russians and the Russian minorities, including groups disloyal to Petrograd, he cannot forget about the problem of the Left Separatists, which still exist even after the proscription of the Russian Left SR party and its allies. Thanks to our Ministry of Security, the leaders, active members and terrorists from the most notorious Left Separatist movements have been arrested and their property has been nationalised."
rusd.161.a:0 "You fought the law and the law won!"

This, and the recent surge of Arabian nationalism, originating from Egypt and Hashemite Arabia, puts our state and its foreign interest in grave danger.

rusfor.1265.d:0 "White Ruthenia was occupied by the Germans in 1918 and later Berlin installed a loyal regime with the German prince on the top. Now however, the White Ruthenian economy is unstable and weak. We can reach an agreement about the purchase of almost all their state bonds, and if they agree with it, we will be able to control their economy, their government, and maybe eventually fully incorporate the country."
rusfor.1265.a:0 "Let's buy them!"
rusfor.1265.b:0 "We shall take back our stolen lands by force!"

rusfor.1266.b:0 "Maybe the Germans will be able to help us."
rusfor.1266.c:0 "We don't need the Russian money!"

rusfor.1267.t:0 "White Ruthenia agrees!"
rusfor.1267.d:0 "Good news from Minsk! The government of White Ruthenia has decided to sell their state bonds to us! Finally the former kingdom is under our direct control and we have become closer to the reunification of the Russian lands!"

rusfor.1268.d:0 "The former kingdom of White Ruthenia was long enough under our control. Should we finally reincorporate it into Russia?"
rusfor.1268.a:0 "Yes, of course!"
rusfor.1268.b:0 "We don't need them."

rusfor.1269.t:0 "White Ruthenia needs our help!"
rusfor.1269.d:0 "The government of White Ruthenia wants our support, because Russia is going to buy their state bonds to control the economy of this small country. It seems that if we don't intervene, White Ruthenia will be soon annexed by the Russians!"
rusfor.1269.a:0 "Warn Russia, they must turn back!"
rusfor.1269.b:0 "They can do what they want."

rusfor.1270.t:0 "Germany supports White Ruthenia!"
rusfor.1270.d:0 "The Germans don't allow us to buy White Ruthenian state bonds. It seems that the Germans are ready to defend their sphere of influence in the Eastern Europe. What should we do?"
rusfor.1270.a:0 "We shall take back our stolen lands by force, right now!"
rusfor.1270.b:0 "We don't need White Ruthenia."

rusfor.1271.t:0 "We are alone!"
rusfor.1271.d:0 "Terrible news! The Germans aren't going to help us. It seems that they don't care about our future! But we still have this Russian proposition. What should we do now?"
rusfor.1271.a:0 "Let's cooperate with the Russians!"
rusfor.1271.b:0 "We will fight alone!"

rusfor.1272.t:0 "White Ruthenia is alone!"
rusfor.1272.d:0 "The German government doesn't want to protect White Ruthenia. But White Ruthenia isn't going to sell us their state bonds. Maybe we should take back our lands, using our army?"
rusfor.1272.a:0 "Let's do it!"
rusfor.1272.b:0 "We don't need White Ruthenia."

rusfor.12722.t:0 "Russia is threatening our hold on White Ruthenia!"
rusfor.12722.d:0 "Russia offered our puppet White Ruthenia to buy some of its state bonds and is now going to control most of its economy. Unfortunately the White Ruthenian government accepted this offer and Russia is now closer than ever from annexing White Ruthenia to their empire for good. Should we intervene?"
rusfor.12722.a:0 "Unacceptable! We'll take back our puppet!"
rusfor.12722.b:0 "They can do what they want."

rusfor.1273.t:0 "Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Central Asia."
rusfor.1273.d:0 "After the annexation of Central Asia, we got many new Muslim citizens, who were ruled before by the local obscurantist priests and preachers. It is obvious, that we have to do something with their legacy and turn our new citizens into loyal and peaceful members of the Russian society. Now we have two propositions - we can establish a special Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Central Asia or give an additional powers to the Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly, which is controlled by the loyal Tatars and Bashkirs."
rusfor.1273.a:0 "Create a new Spiritual Administration."
rusfor.1273.b:0 "Orenburg Assembly will deal with it!"

rusfor.1274.t:0 "Problems in Central Asia."
rusfor.1274.d:0 "Though we have established a new Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Central Asia, but it is still controlled mainly by the same priests, who had been playing a significant role in Central Asia since the Civil war till the annexation. Of course we will have to change the situation here, but it will take us a lot of time."
rusfor.1274.a:0 "Oh well..."

rusfor.1275.t:0 "Pacification of Central Asia."
rusfor.1275.d:0 "Good news from Central Asia - new Tatar and Bashkir Muslim leadership could finally reorganise the system of the local Islamic institutions and partly defeat the obscurantism of the local notable theologians and preachers. Now Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly proposes a new vision of Islam for the Central Asian citizens, which means, that Central Asia will be loyal enough to us and we will be able to pay less attention to this region of Russia."
rusfor.1275.a:0 "That's great!"

rusfor.1276.t:0 "Control over Azerbaijan"
rusfor.1276.d:0 "Since we have given our guarantees to Azerbaijan, the Russian business uses the profits of the cooperation between two countries. Maybe now it is the best time to expand our control over this Caucasian country and strengthen our positions in the Caspian region?"
rusfor.1276.a:0 "Let's do it!"
rusfor.1276.b:0 "We don't need it."

rusfor.1277.t:0 "Restoring control over the Northern Caucasus."
rusfor.1277.d:0 "After the reunification of Don-Kuban with Russia, our government faced the problem of integration of the eastern mountainous districts of the former Cossack state. During the 1920s and early 1930s Ataman Krasnov supported the Terek Cossack Host, which consisted of many Russians, Ossetians and other Christian nations, who kept this part of the Caucasus under Yekaterinodar's control. We have currently deployed the Russian army in the region, but this is a temporary measure. Multiple plans for the reconstruction and pacification of the region have been proposed and we should choose one of them."
rusfor.1277.a:0 "Put the region under control of the local civilian Russians."
rusfor.1277.b:0 "Continue Krasnov's policy - support the Terek Cossack Host and its nations."
rusfor.1277.c:0 "Keep the region under military control!"

rusfor.1278.t:0 "The order in the Northern Caucasus is partially restored."
rusfor.1278.d1:0 "After we had restored military bases in such towns of the Northern Caucasus as Vladikavkaz and Grozny and had left here the limited part of the troops, we have transfered the control over this territory to the local Russians, who had been both members of the Terek Cossack Host or just citizens in the various towns and villages. It seems that while the Russian part of the region has begun to recover very quickly, the districts without Russian involvement are sliding into anarchy and tribal wars. Now many leaders of the non-Russian nations of the Northern Caucasus ask us to restore control over the whole region and promise that they will serve well to the Russian government, since it is the only power, which can secure the region from the eternal crisis."
rusfor.1278.d2:0 "Since we started to support the Terek Cossack Host, we could reach an order rather quick, but because our support exceeded the extent of the support from Krasnov's government, the Host started to expand itself over the non-Christian territory of the eastern part of the Northern Caucasus, which naturally led to the multiple conflicts, especially between the Russians and Ossetians on one side and the Chechens and Ingushes on the other. Moreover, the readiness of the Russian government to deal with the local small nations and tribes led to conflicts with them in Dagestan, where many nations want to become a junior partner of Russia and dominate over their neighbours using Russian protection. All these conflicts will be solved by our government, but it will take some time."
rusfor.1278.d3:0 "We kept the army deployed in the eastern part of the Northern Caucasus and it brought the order to the Russian part of this land, where the local citizens are finally free from the raids and attacks of the mountainous nations. But in the non-Russian parts of the region only some Christian nations support our army, while in some Muslim villages the local people try to start a guerrilla against Russia. No doubt we will stop it and punish the criminals, but it will take some time."
rusfor.1278.a:0 "We should have expected it."

rusfor.1279.t:0 "The order in the Northern Caucasus is restored."
rusfor.1279.d:0 "More than six months have passed since we had retaken Don-Kuban Union. We could finally restore control over the whole region and set up a new local authorities, which help us to pacify Northern Caucasus. The local Russians and other Christian nations have strengthened their positions and are finally free from raids and attacks of the hostile tribes, rebellious nations accepted our rule and the criminals who fought against us either died or immigrated. The new era of the prosperity in the Russian South finally starts!"
rusfor.1279.a:0 "Perfect!"
