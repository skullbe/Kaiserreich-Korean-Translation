#Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Fengtian, known as the 'Three Eastern Provinces' during the Qing and Beiyang periods, were split into nine smaller sub-divisions in 1931 to aid governance and economic planning. The vast majority of Fengtian's industry and mineral wealth is concentrated in the South, while the central and Northern provinces are primarily agricultural. Jehol, to the Southwest of Liaoning Province, remained untouched by the reorganisation, but has suffered thanks to the end of rail traffic through the Liaoxi Corridor, which connected land transportation between Beijing and the Northeast. Thanks to the government's new initiatives incentivising development across the provinces, prosperity will surely increase, but serious structural issues remain, and may become problematic as a result of increasing disparity in development between the north and south.

#The 'Huanghanhui', or 'Imperial Han Society', have been found to be using bribes and threats of violence to coerce low-level members of the Assembly. Unfortunately this information has gone public, even as the Assemblymen in question have been removed from office, and local police pursue additional suspects.\n\nShortly after information regarding this incident was presented to Japanese authorities, Kempeitai agents were observed entering an enclosed compound outside Shenyang, and reports indicate gunfire was exchanged. Over a dozen bodies were removed from the premises, and it would be unwise to pursue this matter any further."

#"The Imperial Han Society, a secret society with a Han-chauvinistic ideology and uncompromising hate of other ethnicities, is believed to be behind a number of killings in Shenyang, Changchun, and Harbin. The targets appear to be more or less random, linked only by their status as ethnic Russians, Manchu, Koreans, and Japanese. Mantetsu and the Japanese Consulate are demanding investigations, and the Kempeitai have already carted away a number of suspects to an unknown fate."

FNG_Wang_Yongjiangs_Legacy_desc:0 "만주가 가난한 국경 변두리 지역에서 중국에서 가장 부유한 지역 중 하나가 된 것은 전적으로 장쭤린의 재무국장, 고 왕융장의 덕분입니다. 그는 1928년 만리장성 남부에서 일어난 대원수의 '값비싼 여행'에 혐오감을 느껴 사직했고, 곧 임종을 맞았습니다. 그가 하고자 했으나 이루지 못한 일들이 남아있고, 우리는 그 의지를 이어받아야 합니다."

Zhang will also never be happy with being stuck with only Shandong. This means that we will have to split Jiangsu, one way or another. One possibility is to simply split the western Xuhai region, which would go to Zhang, from the eastern Huaiyang region, with the latter including Nantong and going to Chen. It is unlikely Chen will see this as sufficient as the province was ruled from Xuzhou, which is also where the province's most important railroads meet. Another possibility is to separate economic from political control. In this scenario, one would officially run Jiangsu's government, which would of course have to be led by at least a somewhat independent governor. Then the other would be allowed to nominate a lieutenant governor, who would have control over all the province's resources and be allowed to levy taxes and conduct recruitment among other things."

fengtian.280.d:0 "Ore has been mined at Daye for over two thousand years, and today iron from its depths feeds the fires of modern industry in Wuhan, Hubei, and the Lower Yangtze. This did nothing to stop our soldiers, who upon hearing rumors that gold was to be found there, plundered the mine and, in their disappointment at finding nothing of the sort, collapsed its entrance - trapping over one hundred miners inside. A rescue effort has been proposed, but such expense is widely considered wasted on common laborers. Those responsible for the disaster, meanwhile, have deserted and are nowhere to be found."

fengtian.281.d_good:0 "Thanks to an old O&K steam shovel brought over from a neighboring mine, our soldiers were able to break through in time to rescue dozens of miners. Despite their initial reservations, the men seem to feel that the heartfelt gratitude of the laborers and their families made it well worth the effort, and praise by national newspapers has offset most political fallout from the disaster itself.\n\nTo add to the positive turn of events, an assortment of weapons crates were brought up by the grateful miners, which had apparently been stashed there during the enemy's retreat not so long ago."
fengtian.281.a:0 "What a waste."

fengtian.282.d:0 "The years since the formation of our Government have laid for us a solid foundation for national regeneration. We fear no problems, nor are we concerned over impending dangers. We merely lament the fate of the South, the freedom of which was originally brought about by the hard efforts and sacrifices of reformist patriots, and which has since been erased by the old and outmoded forms of government. Today, her people are powerless, and her rulers without integrity, thus allowing the slow degradation of the national condition, and the return to a state of total subservience to Western nations. These old ways are sapping China's national strength, shaking her national foundations, and subjugating her people.\n\nIt is thus that we find ourselves in the North, as the final bastion of all that our predecessors struggled to build, and the bearers of the future of a new China. The regressive [QIE.GetAdjective] government likes to say that, by fortifying the Northeast, we are 'digging a hole to die in'. To this I say 'Forget not what happened in Ju'. It was to Ju that the State of Qi retreated, and from there that it reconquered all that it had lost. When the time is right, the Northeast will be our Ju, and the whole of China will be our Qi. Our victory is inevitable, long live the Republic!"

There is little question that the regressive and illegitimate [QIE.GetAdjective] government stands in the way of progress, oppressing and subjugating the Chinese people, and I have received every assurance that our allies will stand with us to end this injustice. On our part, we should hold fast, fix our eyes steadfastly on our goal, and be firm in our determination. The entire Northeast should carry on with oneness of heart. The final victory will be ours. I urge my ministers, our army, and our people to redouble their efforts in order to attain success.\n\nIt is in this spirit, that I proclaim the beginning of the Year of Righteous Effort, a full three hundred and sixty five days of strenuous national effort, from which we shall emerge as a force unstoppable in the pursuit of our goal. And, when this year is done, the Five Colour Flag will fly high again in Beijing, and the [QIE.GetAdjective] government will be nothing but ash in the winds of history.

According to the military this flagrant disprespect, made all the more despicable in light of our long-standing cooperation with [FNG.GetLeader], cannot go unanswered.

fengtian.287.d:0 "Zhang Zuolin has announced his plans to step back from his position as President of the Republic, making way for his son Xueliang - a promising young man with a Western education, albeit also a troubling if not uncommon relationship with opium. Zuolin will stay on as Grand Marshal, cementing his control over the military, and many are already seeing this move as a way for Zhang to draw attention away from his past banditry and military service, traits considered unbecoming of a national political leader, while retaining a de-facto monopoly on power."

fengtian.288.t:0 "The Shikan Clique Protests"
fengtian.288.d:0 "The Shikan Clique, a group of officers within the Fengtian Army educated at Japanese academies, has quietly but forcefully protested Zhang Zuolin's decision to hand the presidency to his son. Citing Zhang Xueliang's addiction to opium, and his well-known years of carousing in Shanghai's casinos and pleasure palaces, Yang Yuting, the de-facto face of the Shikan group, called the move 'dangerous and divisive'. This is likely an attempt by Yang to jockey for additional power within the Fengtian Clique as a whole, but more concerningly he may also be speaking for the Kwantung Army, which is known to distrust Xueliang due to his anti-Japanese leanings."
fengtian.288.a:0 "Ineffectual ditherings."

fengtian.289.t:0 "A Sinister Plot"
fengtian.289.d:0 "An unusual notice has made it's way to the government's attention, passed along by Kenji Doihara, whose clandestine operations are well known within our intelligence circles. Apparently Yang Yuting, an influential and notably pro-Japanese general within the Fengtian Army, is plotting the overthrow and assassination of Zhang Zuolin. The move seems to have been spurred by Zhang's decision to grant his son the presidency, which may simply reflect factional squabbling, but the appointment has already been concerning for many in the War Ministry. Zhang Xueliang's anti-Japanese sentiments are well known, and should he seize any real power there could be consequences for our relationship with the Fengtian Government, and our long-laid plans in China as a whole.\n\n"We could choose to support Yang Yuting's power grab, and he is a well known friend to Japan. On the other hand some in the Foreign Ministry are advising caution, and alleging that this entire operation is a product of meddling by our own units based in Manchuria. The Kwantung Army has long been known to have far more assertive foreign policy inclinations than the government in Tokyo."

fengtian.290.d:0 "In the middle of a busy Shenyang street, Zhang Zuolin's custom-built armor-plated car suddenly came under fire as a small bomb exploded under its wheels. The vehicle was thrown violently upward, and then careened into a nearby tailor's shop. A shootout immediately began as ambushers on both sides of the street began to open fire on the car's surviving occupants, and by the time reinforcements arrived almost fifteen minutes later its owner had suffered various burns and injuries by both shrapnel and bullets. Zhang Zuolin's life now hangs in the balance."

fengtian.291.d:0 "Zhang Zuolin was suddenly and unexpectedly struck down by assassins on Shenyang's Zhaode main street only a matter of hours ago. It was his leadership that served to underpin the entirety of the Fengtian Clique and its government, and now the power vacuum left in his wake threatens to swallow the entirety of the Northeast. Soon every soldier and officer, every contact and associate of the Old Marshal, must question his loyalties and pick a side - if there are even to be sides at all. As of now two loose factions seem set to emerge: a collection of loyalists and nationalists beneath Zhang Xueliang's banner, facing a number of Japanese-educated officers and opportunists aligned with Yang Yuting, who almost certainly had some role to play in Zuolin's assassination. Whoever strikes a decisive blow first will be entitled to Zhang Zuolin's legacy."

fengtian.292.d:0 "After convincing the remnants of the cabinet and most of the general staff to take his side, either through persuasion or more coercive means, Zhang Xueliang has emerged as the sole victor following his father's untimely demise. Yang Yuting, meanwhile, has been politically defeated, and soon retreated to a safe-house outside Shenyang to recoup his losses and take stock of the situation.\n\nYang still holds influence with a number of the Fengtian Army's most talented commanders, and so he may be betting on Zhang Xueliang's willingness to compromise and worry that, without them, he may fall behind his enemies elsewhere in China, or even in Japan."

Before them passes an impressive funeral cortege, replete with all the Old Marshal's earthly possessions rendered in paper, so that they may be burned and carried with him up to heaven. Eventually the pallbearers will reach a stone mausoleum outside Shenyang, where the story of this once-bandit who came to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Presidents and Emperors will finally come to an end.

fengtian.295.d:0 "The invitation to play cards came as something of a surprise to Yang Yuting, who had expected a more formal summons. Nontheless, he interpreted the letter as a good sign - perhaps Zhang Xueliang had seen the light and decided to negotiate. He might be taking a risk by walking into the Young Marshal's arms, but it was one he had to take.\n\nHis car arrived at Zhang's mansion in the early evening, and upon entering main hall he received a bullet to the back of the head. There would be no negotiating after all.\n\nThe Shikan Clique has subsequently been dismantled, taken apart man by man in a relentless but pragmatic campaign of revenge. Some generals will be allowed to serve on under close watch, but even slight suspicion of involvement in the Zhaode Incident was a death sentence. The Fengtian Army's cohesion has taken a great blow today, but there could be no other answer."

Though this is an embarassing moment for us, as few expected him to survive or much less discover our involvement, it is also one of crisis.

fengtian.297.d.xueliang:0 "Much to our surprise Zhang Xueliang, believed by most to be an opium-riddled bohemian, has not only prevailed against Yang Yuting but also discovered our involvement in his father's assassination. The fury on his face is not difficult to read, even from the poor photographs obtained by our intelligence services, and today the Young Marshal announced our actions to the world. Though this is an embarassing moment for us, we cannot take this direct challenge lying down. Yet aggressive action would destroy our only partnership on the Chinese mainland, and render the whole of the country hostile once again. There is no easy way out of this mess." #Xueliang took over

fengtian.298.t:0 "The Zhaode Dajie Incident"
fengtian.298.d:0 "It seems that the attack on Zhaode Main Street was carried out at the behest of none other than Yang Yuting, leader of the Shikan Clique. After his agents' simultaneous plans were foiled across the country, Yang retreated to a safehouse outside Shenyang. From there he may have intended to flee or fight back, but ultimately it didn't matter. Once it became known that Yang had taken up residence, the structure was levelled by heavy artillery at Zhang's own direction. A body, which may or may not have been Yang's, was pulled from the wreckage, its head decapitated and placed on a pike.\n\nFrom there Shikan Clique was subsequently dismantled, taken apart man by man in a relentless but pragmatic campaign of revenge. Some generals were allowed to serve on under close watch, but even slight suspicion of involvement in the Zhaode Incident was a death sentence.

fengtian.299.t:0 "Yuting Takes Over"
fengtian.299.d:0 "Travelers attempting to enter Shenyang this evening were shocked to witness troops of the Kwantung Army rush out of the darkness and onto the roads, hurriedly deploying searchlights, sandbags, and machine guns along all the city's main thoroughfares. Soon their opposition arrived, batallions of Fengtian Army troops from Fushin, Liaoyang, and Xinmin, called there by Zhang Xueliang's plea for reinforcements. As these troops attempted to negotiate their way into the city, Yang Yuting's forces seized key positions across Shenyang in a matter of hours. By dawn, and with the Japanese troops refusing to budge, the Young Marshal's resistance had been crushed, and Japan announced its intent to 'safeguard regional security' by deploying additional troops in the area. Unable to break the deadlock and now threatened by crack Japanese divisions, loyalist units around the city peeled away and broke apart - mirroring others across the country as Japanese troops soon swept across the region.\n\nThe Fengtian Government is, for all intents and purposes, dead. With Yang Yuting at the helm it has become just another Japanese puppet, meaning that its allies have broken away and its political support has collapsed. The way forward is unclear."
fengtian.299.a:0 "A new era."

fengtian.300.t:0 "A Puppet in Manchuria"
fengtian.300.d:0 "All our best efforts in Manchuria have come to fruition. With Zhang Zuolin dead and Zhang Xueliang out of the picture, Yang Yuting should prove a pliable puppet suited to our purposes. While we may no longer have an easy route to control of China as a whole, we have safeguarded our own security. Without Manchurian resources our economy would founder, and from there an enemy could easily take Korea, then plunge a dagger into the heart of Japan. This is how history is made."

fengtian.301.t:0 "The End of Fengtian"
fengtian.301.d:0 "The situation in Manchuria appears dire. With Zhang's death, the Fengtian Government has essentially collapsed upon itself, and if we do not intervene their enemies will soon overrun them, invalidating all our work to make Manchuriua secure.

fengtian.305.d:0 "Word has come from our spies in Tokyo - the Japanese may be preparing for war. Supposedly our Manchurian enemies have requested Japanese assistance in their war against us, which is now under consideration by the Imperial Cabinet and General Headquarters. On the one hand this news is a tacit acknowledgement by Fengtian that it has lost all claim to legitimacy, direct reliance on Japan is a political blow from which it may never recover, but on the other hand it is deeply troubling. Even now Japan's vast imperial war machine may be rumbling to life, to be stopped only by the most resolute defense."
fengtian.305.a:0 "We shall learn of their decision soon."

fengtian.306.t:0 "Attacks on the South Manchuria Railway"
fengtian.306.d:0 "Left to their own devices for over two weeks, the loyalists in Harbin launched a series of coordinated attacks along the South Manchurian Railway. Fortunately some of our commanders acted on their own initiative and, with help from Japanese Railway Zone guards, were able to limit the damage and push the outnumbered enemy back into the city.\n\nWhat followed was a brutal street-by-street fight across the city, one which the loyalists had obviously prepared for, and our casualties mounted quickly. In a final act of defiance, the enemy detonated explosives inside several factories, but by daybreak silence ruled the city - broken only by occasional gunshots marking the executions of survivors.\n\nHarbin is ours once again."
fengtian.306.a:0 "At least they're dealt with"

fengtian.307.t:0 "A Meeting with Merchants"
fengtian.307.d:0 "The Fengtian Chamber of Commerce represents the interests of numerous merchants in Shenyang and across the Northeast, most of whom are responsible for the proper functioning of our economy - at least those parts of it still outside Japanese hands. Their bargaining power is considerable, and with new authorities in the capital, they are hoping for a new deal that better serves themselves.\n\nZhang Zuolin famously shot several merchants and bankers for refusing him favorable terms, but doing the same now would set a poor precedent for our new administration - one supposedly introducing order and civilization to a war-weary China.\n\nHowever, it would set an equally bad precedent to accept terms worse than our predecessor."
fengtian.307.a:0 "Perhaps we can grease some palms"
fengtian.307.b:0 "Maybe Zhang had the right idea"
fengtian.307.c:0 "Never mind for now"

fengtian.308.t:0 "Restoring Order to Manchuria"
fengtian.308.d:0 "Despite the death of 'Grand Marshal' Zhang Zuolin, some of his legacy yet remains. Various civilian authorities across the region have either ignored or refused the order to recognize our new administration, and some still loyal to his cause have reportedly been coalescing in Harbin - perhaps to make a last stand.\n\nFor the time being our resources will be more limited than we might prefer, and we should focus our efforts on returning control and good government to Manchuria. The last remnants of Zhang's government must be swept away."
fengtian.308.a:0 "Onward!"

fengtian.309.t:0 "Pressing North"
fengtian.309.d:0 "With the threat at Harbin eliminated, our Japanese advisors have recommended that we advance north along the railway. These frigid regions of Manchuria, themselves as large as some European countries put together, were beyond even Zhang Zuolin's direct control at times and again prove troublesome.\n\nOur greatest concern, however, ought to be the Russians, who have on occasion tested our borders and notoriously covet the Chinese Eastern Railway - seized from them over a decade ago. The Japanese want the Russians checked at the Amur."

fngpolitic.29.a:0 "막아내야만 한다."

fngpolitic.30.t:0 "The Generals Grow Restless"
fngpolitic.30.d:0 "Worried by their diminishing influence in the Assembly, and throughout the government, powerful members among the Zhang Clique have begun voicing their discontent, claiming that if they so desired, the entire assembly could be dissolved in minutes by force of arms. These statements have been reinforced by a slow but steady increase in the capital's garrison, which would almost certainly overwhelmingly side with their patron generals in the event of any political upheaval."
fngpolitic.30.a:0 "Worrying..."

fngpolitic.31.t:0 "Railway and Telegraph Mysteries"
fngpolitic.31.d:0 "Ministers and other government officials have strangely found themselves immensely inconvenienced as of late, with telegrams going missing or relayed to the wrong people, secrets uttered only over the telephone suddenly becoming public, and trains mysteriously arriving chronically late. Of course, many are well aware that this is merely the Communications Clique showing its discontent with its recent diminishing influence, and it seems likely that these measures it has taken will reinforce its necessity to the government's effective functioning."
fngpolitic.31.a:0 "Such is politics."

fngpolitic.32.t:0 "Communications Clique Leads Railroad Strikes"
fngpolitic.32.d:0 "The Communications Clique, with its widespread influence in Chinese-owned Manchurian railroads like the CER, has resorted to encouraging union activity and strikes to compensate for its recent losses of influence in government. The Clique will likely only go so far, for risk of creating something it cannot control, but their methods have already been fairly successful in demonstrating their political and economic clout."
fngpolitic.32.a:0 "Troubling."

fngshen.1.t:0 "The Shenyang Conference"
fngshen.1.d1:0 "As it stands, [QIE.GetNameDef] presents the most powerful obstacle against our ambitions for China and Asia as a whole. Although we have the means to defeat them alone it would certainly be a daunting and costly task. Worse yet, we run a significant risk of being seen as Japan's crony if we go at it alone, allowing [QIE.GetLeader] to rally the other warlords against us. We must not allow this to happen.\n\nIn order to show to our friends in Asia that we're a legitimate power when we stand up to [QIE.GetNameDef], we have organized a conference to be held in Shenyang where we'll form a coalition against them. Not only will this strengthen our position, but it will also prove our legitimacy to the world."
fngshen.1.d2:0 "We have been forced to already commence our Reclamation War against [QIE.GetNameDef], even though not all of our allies may have been ready. However, some may yet be swayed to our side during this conflict. We must reach out to the Anqing Clique to the south, which has just come out victorious against the League and hope to immediately get them to join our side. We cannot afford the resources now to aid them in reconstruction, as we are already occupied with the war."
fngshen.1.a:0 "Send the invitations."

fngshen.2.t:0 "Invited to the Shenyang Conference"
fngshen.2.ddef:0 "Today we formally received an invitation to the Shenyang Conference hosted by [From.GetNameDef]. Its goal is to allow us to improve our coordination in future conflicts and create a broader cooperation between [From.GetCliqueShortName] and the other powers across China. As we have nothing to lose by accepting their friendly invitation and participating in the conference, we will accept and attend."
fngshen.2.danq:0 "We have received an invitation to the Shenyang Conference hosted by [From.GetNameDef]. They hope to discuss important issues related to us joining their Reclamation War against [QIE.GetNameDef], which has already begun. As they aided us in our conflict to reunite the Five Provinces, we should hear them out. They have also let us know they currently cannot spare any resources to aid us in our reconstruction, as they are fully occupied with the war."
fngshen.2.a:0 "Send a delegation."

fngshen.3.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Agrees to the Conference"
fngshen.3.d:0 "Good news! [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has replied to our invitation and they have agreed to attend the Conference. We can expect their delegation to arrive soon."
fngshen.3.d1:0 "Good news! [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has replied to our invitation and they have agreed to attend the Conference. We can expect their delegation to arrive soon. However, we must note that their current loyalties lie with [ANQ.GetLeader] as Anqing took Shandong in the League War and puppeted them. They have promised the province to us once the war begins, however."
fngshen.3.a:0 "Excellent."

fngshen.4.t:0 "Negotiations with the Federalists?"
fngshen.4.d.no_allies:0 "Our diplomatic state currently leaves much to be desired. Besides Japan, we have no natural allies in the region that would be able to cooperate with us against [QIE.GetNameDef]. This leaves us with the unorthodox but still present possibility of approaching the Federalists to support us. While they are anything but insignificant, we certainly have our fair share of ideological differences. Be that as it may - if we can bridge them, they could become a potent ally in the conflict ahead."
fngshen.4.d.conference:0 "While we have gained ground with our recent diplomatic efforts, the question of whether or not to engage the Federalists has been raised by some of our advisers. While we have our fair share of ideological differences, they argue that our growing strength and influence should allow us to overcome this hurdle and add another ally to our ranks. Thanks to our other successes however, we could always decline to do so and spare ourselves from their inevitable demands."
fngshen.4.a:0 "Let's try to find common ground."
fngshen.4.b:0 "Don't bother."

fngshen.5.t:0 "An Offer from [From.GetCliqueShortName]"
fngshen.5.d.no_allies:0 "Today we received a message from [From.GetNameDef] where they wish to invite us to discuss possible cooperation against the [QIE.GetNameDef]. While we don't see eye to eye on a lot of issues, we can perhaps attribute their more welcoming tone as a result of the broader isolation that they're suffering from. Given their lack of friends in the region, attending would allow us to encourage them to agree to sorely needed reforms in exchange for our helping hand. How should we reply?"
fngshen.5.d.conference:0 "In a rather surprising development, [From.GetCliqueShortName] has invited us to attend their conference in Shenyang. Their goal is to create a broad coalition against [QIE.GetNameDef]. So far, they seem to have had some success in bringing the other warlords on board. Perhaps if we attended, we could get them to agree to undertake some sorely needed reforms. How should we respond to their invitation?"
fngshen.5.a:0 "Very well, let's go to Shenyang."
fngshen.5.b:0 "We don't trust them."

fngshen.6.t.accepted:0 "[From.GetCliqueShortName] Agrees to the Conference"
fngshen.6.d.accepted:0 "Good news! [From.GetLeader] has replied to our invitation to attend the Shenyang Conference. He has agreed to attend the conference and we should expect a Federalist delegation to arrive in short order."
fngshen.6.a:0 "Excellent."

fngshen.6.t.refused:0 "[From.GetCliqueShortName] Refuses our Offer"
fngshen.6.d.refused:0 "Perhaps unsurprisingly, [From.GetLeader] has refused our olive branch. In the letter he sent in reply to our invitation, he cited the Japanese influence as the primary reason, claiming that he doubted our ability to speak for ourselves rather than simply doing Tokyo's bidding."
fngshen.6.b:0 "Their loss."

fngshen.7.t:0 "Start of the Shenyang Conference"
fngshen.7.d:0 "The big day has finally arrived. Delegates have arrived to discuss [From.GetCliqueShortName]'s initiative against the regime in Beijing. A brief opening ceremony was held, culminating in an introductory speech by Zhang Zuolin. Everyone's in good spirit, though no one doubts the diplomatic challenges that lie ahead."
fngshen.7.a:0 "Let's begin."

fngshen.8.t:0 "Heated Discussions"
fngshen.8.d:0 "Everyone knew that [ANQ.GetLeader]and [SQI.GetLeader] would have a hard time cooperating given their mutual dislike. Unfortunately, they've allowed this turn into a public dispute that has already disrupted the talks. Zhang in particular has caused a scene as his mannerisms are enough to make even the most hardened warlord raise an eyebrow. We can only hope that this won't set a trend as the conference goes on."
fngshen.8.a:0 "Cut it out, both of you!"

fngshen.9.t:0 "Federalists Press for Reforms"
fngshen.9.d:0 "As expected from the Federalists, [FNG_shenyang_federalist_leader.GetLeader] has been attempting to pressure Zhang Zuolin to adopt reforms. The aim of these would be the gradual liberalization of [From.GetCliqueShortName] and ideally - for him - that these reforms at the head would trickle down to influence the other warlords as well. It's clear that the Federalists aren't prepared to support Zhang without getting something in return."
fngshen.9.a:0 "Make vague promises."

fngshen.10.t:0 "The Anti-Concessionist Question"
fngshen.10.d.ANQ:0 "Fierce opponents of the Concessions to the colonial powers, the [ANQ.GetCliqueShortName] delegation has been actively pressuring Fengtian to accept a firm stance against the Concessions. Zhang Zuolin has been reluctant to make any definitive pledges on the matter so far, but that hasn't made the issue go away. It's evident that this won't last long if the conference is to move forward."
fngshen.10.d.GXC:0 "Fierce opponents of the Concessions to the colonial powers, the [ANQ.GetCliqueShortName] delegation has been actively pressuring Fengtian to accept a firm stance against the Concessions. They've been supported in this endeavor by the Federalists, who are equally defiant against the Concessions albeit from a more liberal position. While Zhang Zuolin has been reluctant to state an official position on the matter so far, he's likely to be forced to do so soon. As the influence that the two Chens wield is gaining momentum, this issue isn't likely to go away."
fngshen.10.a:0 "They might have a point..."

fngshen.11.t:0 "[ANQ.GetCliqueShortName] and [FNG_shenyang_federalist_leader.GetCliqueShortName] Find Common Ground"
fngshen.11.d:0 "United by a staunch Anti-Concessionist platform, the two Chens of [ANQ.GetCliqueShortName] and [FNG_shenyang_federalist_leader.GetCliqueShortName] have formed what's essentially a bloc in the conference. With broad support for their positions, Zhang Zuolin's undeclared position is becoming more and more untenable by the hour."
fngshen.11.a:0 "This may be a problem."

fngshen.12.t:0 "Zongchang's Drunken Rants"
fngshen.12.d:0 "After drinking Sake by what we can only assume to be the barrel-load, [SQI.GetLeader] has created a scene today as he slurred and yelled his way through a drunken tirade. What little could be understood of his ravings were nothing short of a love letter to Japan with only his love for Japanese booze and women being comprehended by the hostage audience, if only through repetition. Most of Zhang's incomprehensible ravings were, for better or for worse, impossible to understand, which may have been a blessing in disguise.\n\nAfter creating a spectacular scene, he got up on his chair and put one boot down on the table. Before he could be made to sit down again, he declared a toast to Japan, with the rest of his speech sounded more like a man struggling to hold back vomit than actual words. To say that this has created a negative atmosphere among the conference attendants would be the understatement of the decade."
fngshen.12.a:0 "Stop embarassing us!"

fngshen.13.t:0 "Yang Yuting Urges Caution"
fngshen.13.d:0 "With Anti-Concessionist sentiments rising, Yang Yuting has come forward to urge Zuolin to be cautious with regards to the stance on the Concessions. Because of Japan's strong interests in them, particularly through its China Agency in the Legation Cities, they stand to lose greatly if we went ahead and declared ourselves to be against the Concessions. Because of our healthy and mutually beneficial cooperation, alienating them would be seen by Tokyo as not merely an insult, but naked aggression against them.\n\nWhile hardly unexpected, Yuting's actions prove that Japan is worried about our eventual decision. If nothing else, it's a reminder that they will not sit idly by if we join the Anti-Concessionist movement."
fngshen.13.a:0 "A fair warning."

fngshen.14.t:0 "The Point of Decision"
fngshen.14.d:0 "Facing insurmountable pressure from his potential partners, Zuolin must decide whether he agrees to the Anti-Concessionist stance that has overtaken the conference or tries to argue against them. Siding against the Anti-Concessionists would severely hinder our chances of forming a strong alliance. Adopting an Anti-Concessionist stance, however, would severely anger Tokyo."
fngshen.14.a:0 "Very well, we accept."
fngshen.14.b:0 "We cannot afford angering Japan."

fngshen.15.t:0 "The Federalist-[FNG.GetCliqueShortName] Alliance"
fngshen.15.d:0 "It wasn't easy to overcome the numerous differences between us. In the end though, pragmatism won out and enough common ground was found to make this unlikely friendship a reality. [FNG.GetCliqueShortName] and the Federalists of [FNG_shenyang_federalist_leader.GetCliqueShortName] are now on the same side following a long series of secretive negotiations. Let us hope that this alliance stands the test of time."
fngshen.15.a:0 "Excellent."

fngshen.16.t:0 "[ANQ.GetCliqueShortName] Thanks Us"
fngshen.16.d:0 "We've received official word from [ANQ.GetLeader] that they are happy we took an Anti-Concessionist stance. However, they have not yet weighed all the matters concerning their decision to join us in our Reclamation War. We await their final decision."
fngshen.16.a:0 "We'll have to wait."

fngshen.17.t:0 "End of the Conference"
fngshen.17.d:0 "Although there was no shortage of hurdles to overcome along the way, diplomacy has won the day. The Shenyang Conference has ended in a success for [Root.GetCliqueShortName], cementing their position in the region at the expense of the Beijing government. The delegates left the city after a cordial closing ceremony. Zhang Zuolin is now several steps closer to turning his ambitions into reality."
fngshen.17.danq:0 "Although there was no shortage of hurdles to overcome along the way, diplomacy has won the day. The Shenyang Conference has ended in a success for [Root.GetCliqueShortName], cementing their position in the region at the expense of the Beijing government.

fngshen.17.a:0 "Next stop: Beijing!"
fngshen.17.b:0 "We'll make the right decision."

fngshen.18.t:0 "The Federalists Storm Off"
fngshen.18.d:0 "Finding a compromise on the Concessions proved to be an insurmountable task. It was simply politically impossible for the Federalists to make a complete U-turn on the matter, while Zhang's refusal to budge is being publicly mocked as a simple refusal to bite the hand that feeds it. After publicly denouncing the conference as a sham, the Federalist delegation led by [FNG_shenyang_federalist_leader.GetLeader] left the conference. Any chance for an alliance between them and [Root.GetCliqueShortName] is now likely an outright impossibility."
fngshen.18.a:0 "This will be trouble."

fngshen.19.t:0 "장쭤린이 우리의 요구를 거부하다"
fngshen.19.d:0 "Evidently, Zuolin simply could not bite the hand that fed him. By declaring his opposition to the anti-Concessionists, he's showed his colors for all of China to see. There's absolutely no way we can side with [From.GetCliqueShortName] under these circumstances. While we'd hoped that he'd see reason, we can't say we're surprised either. Our delegation left the conference earlier today, leaving Zuolin with his Japanese cronies."
fngshen.19.a:0 "일본의 꼭두각시에게 뭘 기대하겠는가?"

fngshen.20.t:0 "[From.GetCliqueShortName] Refuses to Denounce the Concessions"
fngshen.20.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, our delegates could not convince Zuolin to stand against the concessions. We'll not let this go lightly, but we must not commit any rash actions and immediately denounce Zuolin. Let us look at the factors and decide whether or not to join Zuolin in his Reclamation War against Beijing."
fngshen.20.a:0 "Unfortunate."

fngshen.21.t:0 "천탸오위안이 자신의 위치를 결정하다"
fngshen.21.d:0 "The [FNG.GetCliqueShortName] stance on the Concessionist question greatly angered [ANQ.GetCliqueShortName]'s Chen Tiaoyuan. However, [ANQ.GetCliqueShortName] delegates have informed us that the decision whether or not they will join our war against Beijing and enter into an alliance with us has yet to be made. We eagerly await their final answer."

With this victory we have taken the first major step toward national reunification, and resumed our role as an active contender for national leadership.\n\nIntending to seize the moment, Marshal Zhang has ordered his staff to begin assembling a plan for the peaceful unification of China. If put into motion - and more importantly, agreed upon - it would see the remaining provinces in China united without any further bloodshed, raising the legitimacy of our government immeasurably. The plan is not without its opponents, of course, as some politicians doubt an undertaking of this scale can be accomplished, while some members of the military believe that diplomacy will only prevent the formation of a strong central authority and leave the country again united in name only.\n\nWe must carefully consider this decision, as the stroke of a pen here could have a far bigger impact than any order the Old Marshal has given in his long and storied career."

Supporters of the notion emphasize unity in the face of Western imperialism, whereas the detractors cite everything from Zuolin's dependence on Japanese support to the very structure of the Fengtian Government.\n\nPast disagreements and disputes aside, the fact that the winds are blowing in Zhang Zuolin's direction means that we wouldn't lose face by attending, but simply attending might grant him legitimacy."

With the winds clearly blowing in his direction, Zhang Zuolin believes that this is the best opportunity to pull the country together, as no one else can legitimately claim to be able to fill the power vacuum left in the wake of former Beijing government's collapse.\n\nSubsequently, we need to decide what our role in the conference, if any, should be. While we naturally cannot be represented by regular delegates, many in the Foreign Ministry have suggested that we should demand observer status. While we would not have any voting rights, some are arguing that our presence would support claims that Zhang Zuolin is operating at our behest, and thus undermine both our positions in China. The rest, however, seem to agree that our reasons to attend are legitimate, and that we shouldn't be held captive by the irrational fears of Chinese nationalists. After all, should this conference begin to develop in a direction contrary to Japanese interests, it would be best to know first hand - and perhaps to tip the balance in our favor."

fngconf.11.d:0 "In Beijing, one of the key moments on today's agenda was a speech given by Chen Tiaoyuan, the former governor of Anhui Province who rose to prominence during the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces. He congratulated the Fengtian government's efforts under [FNG.GetLeader] to resist German imperialism, as well as their many lackeys who put the interests of foreigners ahead of fellow Chinese, but warned that he expects the same stubborn resistance against any other foreign aggressors. The speech was met with applause from every corner of the chamber, though some interpreted the speech as a subtle criticism of Zhang Zuolin's ties to the Japanese."

The proposal would clearly outline the rights and powers given to both the people and the government, but not everyone is pleased. Chen Jiongming has expectedly proven a full-throated critic of the proposal in its present form, which he claims would grant too much power to the nation's executive. Instead he would prefer the restoration of the suspended 1923 constitution, which is widely considered China's most liberal to date. The federalist bloc quickly lined up behind Chen, and this will no doubt remain a thorny issue as the conference goes on."
fngconf.12.d.no_federalist:0 "As the conference started, the first order of this day was the proposed creation of a new constitution. While it may not be what everyone wanted, it seems to be something everyone can agree on, or at the very least accept, as it clearly defines the rights, powers and limitations set on the government's branches. After some debate and a few proposed amendments, it seems like it's broadly being agreed upon. Some commenters have noted that the relative equanimity shown is a sign that few present plan to follow the constitution's actual tenets in the long term."

fngconf.13.t:0 "Disagreements With The Federalists"
fngconf.13.d:0 "Disagreements over the constitution have been center floor to the confernce virtually since its start, and now the Federalists have been joined by other delegates who, while they may not share the same concerns as the Federalists, have used this opportunity to get some of their more minor concerns addressed.\n\nWhile they would likely have accepted the proposed constitution it as it was, the staunch opposition mounted by the Federalists over this issue has allowed them to join forces and form a sizable albeit informal opposition bloc in the conference halls, large enough to hold up the rest of the conference. It would seem that proceedings have stalled until either side budges or offers a compromise."
fngconf.13.a:0 "We need a solution."
fngconf.13.b:0 "This could be a problem."

fngconf.14.t:0 "A Compromise Is Proposed"
fngconf.14.d.FNG:0 "After days of vigorous debate, a compromise was finally reached reached between the parties, which they're now presenting to us. The 1923 constitution will be broadly restored as it is but with clear checks on a weakened executive along with a centralized army. To accept this compromise Chen Jiongming demands the position of Prime Minister under Zhang Xueliang as President. Under this proposal, Zhang Zuolin would also get the title of Grand Marshal of the army.\n\nWhile it's a tough pill to swallow, it's unlikely that we'll get a much better deal out of them. As such, many in our camp are suggesting that we accept it as even a handful of defections could give their bloc a majority. Others are, however, insisting that we should call the Federalists bluff and that Chen's demands to be the prime minister are unreasonable. How should we act?"
fngconf.14.d.others:0 "After days of negotiations, a compromise has been reached. The restoration of the 1923 constitution will go ahead with more checks on the executive and a centralized army. Under this deal, Jiongming will be the Prime Minister under Xueliang as President. This army will be headed by Zuolin as Grand Marshal.\n\nWhile it isn't something everyone's happy with, it's hopefully something that everyone can agree on. We now await the response from Fengtian."

fngconf.15.d.rejected:0 "With the constitutional compromise rejected, we expected the Federalists to come forward with a more rational proposal that wasn't a naked power grab by Chen Jiongming. Unfortunately, they returned after some deliberations by declaring to everyone that they were abandoning the conference while denouncing the Fengtian leaders. A portion of the conference hall is now glaringly empty without their presence. While certainly not ideal, the conference can at least go on without any further interruptions." #Non-Federalist POV
fngconf.15.d.rejected_feds:0 "With Fengtian refusing to budge on the implementation of the 1924 constitution without watering it down, the Federalists have given up on trying to negotiate any further. After denouncing Zuolin's refusal to compromise, their bloc of delegates promptly left the conference hall and are already on their way out of Beijing. Though the conference continues, the numerous vacant seats in the chambers have left a scar on its legitimacy." #Federalist POV
fngconf.15.d.betrayed:0 "Despite their differences a compromise between Zhang Zuolin and Chen Jiongming's Federalists might have been possible, but it was not to be. Ironically the point of contention was not ideological in any form, but instead territorial. Fengtian promised Federalist territory to another claimant, hoping to bring them on board, but in doing so Zhang unintentionally destroyed any goodwill between himself and his Federalist negotiating partners. Furious, they are already on their way out of the city." #Non-Federalist POV
fngconf.15.d.betrayed_feds:0 "Despite our differences, a compromise with Zhang Zuolin's Fengtian Government might have been possible. But, now it is clear that such dreams were simply never meant to be. In a brazen act of betrayal Zhang promised portions of our territory to another claimant, and in so doing proved himself no better than any other predatory warlord. We cannot accept such an insult, and our delegates are already planning to leave the conference tomorrow." #Federalist POV

fngconf.16.t:0 "Song Qingling Takes the Floor"
fngconf.16.d:0 "With her very presence at the conference controversial, the Kuomintang luminary's speech was inevitably going to draw a lot of attention. Despite the total defeat of her organization militarily, her late husband's legacy still carries with it the sympathies of many republicans and intellectuals across the country, making her support a valuable commodity - especially for Zhang Zuolin, who continues to seek external legitimacy. Predictably, Song Qingling denounced the inability of previous regimes to address the real wants and needs of the population, and declared that any truly legitimate Chinese government must succeed where its predecessors failed. Her words drew some polite applause from other delegates, but there's no doubt that her eventual proposed reforms will prove controversial with the more conservative delegates."
fngconf.16.a:0 "Let's see what she proposes."

fngconf.17.t:0 "The Sanmin Negotiations"
fngconf.17.d:0 "Most warlords have had a shaky relationship with the ideology of Dr. Sun Yat-sen both before and after his death in 1925. Several, including Zhang Zuolin, have at times claimed to be inheritors of his legacy, keen to draw support from his former adherents despite their own indifference to the ideas themselves. Now, however, Zhang may have to pick a side a stick with it. Among Song Qingling's demands are the formal adoption of the Three Principles of the People, which in theory would force Zhang to turn his back on the Japanese, implement democratic reforms, and commit to widespread social programs.\n\nReality suggests compromise as the only route forward, and fortunately the principles are open to interpretation. Already the Fengtian camp has indicated its willingness to support the first and third of the three principles, if the second is only nominally implemented. Zhang will promise to take a hard-line with the Japanese, fund some of Song's welfare initiatives, and place his son Xueliang as President of the Republic, so long as real power remains in his hands via the military."

fngconf.18.t.success:0 "The Four Principles Of The People"
fngconf.18.d.success:0 "Negotiations were tough, but in the end both parties' willingness to compromise prevailed. The promised ascendency of Zhang Zuolin and his son Xueliang has been seen by conservatives as a sufficient safeguard against radicalism, and a sign that while times are changing China's traditional values will be respected rather than uprooted.\n\nWhen all was said and done, the negotiations ended with Song expressing her gratitude towards Fengtian for their willingness to cooperate and compromise. She has pledged her personal support for Zuolin's initiative to unify China, handing him a powerful tool with which to curry legitimacy on the national stage."
fngconf.18.a:0 "Excellent."

fngconf.18.t.failure:0 "Divided Over Principles"
fngconf.18.d.failure:0 "Evidently, the number of social and political reforms required to appease Song Qiongling has proven too bitter of a pill for Fengtian and its allies to swallow, while Song herself refused to 'desecrate' the legacy of her husband with the aims of an upstart warlord and former bandit.\n\nSubsequently the negotiations ended in failure, and Song Qingling promptly left Beijing and returned to China's political wilderness. While it may not be a huge surprise that this wide ideological rift couldn't be bridged, it's nonetheless a blow to the idea of Chinese unity and Zhang Zuolin's quest for national legitimacy."

Zhang may be openly opposed to Western imperialism, but even now Japanese observers are privy to the unification conference's every debate and back-room deal.\n\nNow Chen Tiaoyuan of Anqing, who has built his political platform on anti-concessionism, privately 'reminded' Zhang Zuolin of his earlier promise to denounce the concessions.

Anqing's Chen Tiaoyuan and the federalist Chen Jiongming have found common ground in their opposition to the concessions and have formed a united bloc.

By joining the anti-concessionists, we would be directly opposing our nominal friends in Tokyo, and the act would constitute a betrayal in many eyes. Be that as it may, by declaring our opposition to the anti-concessionist cause we would severely undermine our legitimacy and give ammunition to those that wish to paint us as mere puppets of the Japanese.

Zhang's remaining supporters have been quick to point out that Chen also owes his position to Fengtian's aid, and blame this disaster upon the machinations of the radical Song - an Empress Nanfeng for a new age!"

fngconf.30.d:0 "Chen Tiaoyuan, whose ascendancy in Eastern China is owed largely to his popular anti-concessionist platform, has predictably emerged as a vocal critic of Zhang Zuolin's recent apology to the Japanese. However, he has stopped short of electing to leave the conference entirely, which has been interpreted by most at the conference as a sign that this is ultimately a face saving measure and little more. Fengtian has been Chen's main sponsor, and breaking away from his protecting umbrella would not only leave Anqing adrift, but also leave its expansive coastal regions vulnerable to a Japanese invasion.\n\nChen's words are fierce, but may end up more bark than bite."
fngconf.30.a:0 "He'll calm down eventually..."

fngconf.31.t:0 "The Conference Continues"
fngconf.31.d:0 "With the most contentious national-level issues dealt with, the conference is well on the way toward its conclusion. There remain the various parties' conflicting territorial claims, however."
fngconf.31.a:0 "Let's begin."

fngconf.32.t:0 "The Conference Falls Apart"
fngconf.32.d.failure:0 "With more and more delegates abandoning the conference, it wasn't long before the empty seats were in the majority. By this point, it's clear to any honest observer that nothing decided here will matter, as the conference has been sapped of its legitimacy. Even internationally, it's being mocked in the press as yet another floundering attempt at unification, and Zuolin himself as yet another figure in the long line of failed, self-serving Chinese strongmen.\n\nRealizing that the conference is now indelibly stained, it was with a heavy heart and great disappointment that Zhang declared the conference to be a failure, and committed to uniting China by the sword."
fngconf.32.d.cancelled:0 "After Zhang Zuolin's untimely passing, many wondered if the initiative for a unified China that he led would die with him. Today the answer to any such speculation came as his successor, the Kwantung-backed Yang Yuting, called off the conference with immediate effect and declared any prior decision to have come out of it to be null and void.\n\nWhile Japan's role in this seems obvious, there's nothing to be gained from pointing fingers now. The attempt to unify China peacefully has died along with Zuolin, and there likely won't be another chance to do so without bloodshed for years to come."
fngconf.32.d.beijing_lost:0 "A tense atmosphere had grown with each day as hostile forces marched closer and closer to Beijing. For a conference aimed at uniting China by the pen rather than the sword, its entire legitimacy was cast into doubt once the Fengtian Army began to retreat, ceding more and more land until Beijing itself became the front line. As the situation worsened, the city itself became a battlefield, and the wounds caused by the last battle over the ancient city were quickly reopened as gunfire and shelling marked its streets.\n\nEven before the enemy entered the city, measures were taken to evacuate the delegates, and it wasn't long until these hastily drawn evacuation plans had to be put into effect. By the end of the same week, the Fengtian Army had been chased out of the city.\n\nThe conference collapsed before the city fell, and with it disappeared any hope of the participants returning. Needless to say, this has been a profound humiliation for Zhang Zuolin. Not only has the unification initiative been an utter failure, but his armies were routed from one of the great cities of Asia while the whole world watched."
fngconf.32.a:0 "Force will unite China, then."
fngconf.32.b:0 "What a waste of time."

fngconf.33.t:0 "Zhang Zuolin Stands Defiant"
fngconf.33.d:0 "Unfortunately Fengtian has not seen reason. Zhang Zuolin has rejected our demands, insisting that the 'century of humiliation' must come to an end.\n\nThis compounded insult is absolutely unacceptable! Now even the most moderate voices are insisting that we send Zhang an ultimatum which cannot be ignored. Others, already hawkish generals among them, are insisting that we should simply invade Manchuria before Zhang can mobilise against us."
fngconf.33.a:0 "Punish them."
fngconf.33.b:0 "Force is the only answer."
fngconf.33.c:0 "Do nothing for now."

fngconf.34.t:0 "일본이 침묵을 지키다"
fngconf.34.d:0 "To everyone's surprise, Japan has issued no response to our refusal of their ultimatum and an attitude they earlier labelled 'impertinent' and 'unacceptable'. Perhaps Japan is simply afraid to undermine our legitimacy, still hoping that we might serve as a bridge for them to tighten their grip over China as a whole. Or, perhaps Japan is a paper tiger, and far weaker than anyone expected."
fngconf.34.a:0 "흥미롭군."

fngconf.35.t:0 "의심스러운 부대가 이동하다"
fngconf.35.d:0 "Ever since our decision to make a stand against Japan, disturbing rumors have spread across the Northeast of an impending Japanese invasion. Now observers in Jilin Province have seemingly found confirmation by reporting suspicious troop movements on the south side of the Yalu River. We must consider immediately strengthening our defences to meet the oncoming blow."
fngconf.35.a:0 "대비해야 한다!"

fngconf.36.t:0 "만주 침공"
fngconf.36.d:0 "Less than an hour ago elements of the Imperial Japanese Army crossed the Yalu River at Sinuiju, Haeju, and Rason. Declaring this a necessary measure to safeguard Japan's 'internationally recognized right to a free hand in Manchuria', and to protect its 'national lifeline', the Japanese Government has declared war in all but name. Already Japan's youth are being called upon to 'fulfill the duty of their fathers' who fought and died in Manchuria in 1905, and there can be no illusions about the seriousness or extent of this war - for us it will soon become one of survival or anhiliation."
fngconf.36.a:0 "항복은 없다!"

fngconf.45.t:0 "Our Time To Make Demands"
fngconf.45.d:0 "With the big questions out of the way, we're now in a position to make our demands for our cooperation. Whether it's land concessions, riches or autonomy, we should ask for what we believe is a fair price for our support. Of course, if we believe that the Fengtian cause is just, we can choose to simply offer them our unconditional support for the betterment of China."
