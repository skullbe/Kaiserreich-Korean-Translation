### Leaders ###
POLITICS_ESTIGARRIBIA_DESC:0 "José Félix Estigarribia, the Hero of the Chaco War, was internationally educated in both military and agricultural affairs. Estigarribia overthrew the dictator Rafael Franco and ended the societal chaos which marked Liberal rule before his ascendence. However, a romantic nationalist, Estigarribia has only encouraged extreme movements which seek to ultimately depose him. Whether he survives politically is an open-ended question that time alone shall answer."
POLITICS_ESTIGARRIBIA_RETURNED_DESC:0 "José Félix Estigarribia, the Hero of the Chaco War, was internationally educated in both military and agricultural affairs. Estigarribia overthrew the dictator Rafael Franco and ended the societal chaos which marked Liberal rule before his ascendence.\nWith the return of democracy, Estigarribia's political career at first seemed to have come to an end. Estigarribia, however, has defied expectations and again risen through the ranks of the liberal party. Democratically elected, his hold on the state now is no where near as great as it once was, and though some fear he shall again seize dictatorial power, the masses cheer on the ever adaptable Hero of the Chaco War."

PAR_pensions_desc:0 "War veterans, families of the lost and many other personnel receive rightful compensation for defending our nation in the war for the Chaco. However, doing the right thing is often costly and our budget suffers from all the privileges and good payment for military personnel"
PAR_prussia_desc:0 "Paraguay at this point is an extension of its army, as the Civil War coupled with the failure of mainstream parties resulted in two coups and an almost entire lack of civil presence in actual decision making. The army is however immensely respected, and morale even among the lowest in the hierarchy is sky high, as are the generous benefits for joining it in comparison to common work available"
PAR_bm_desc:0 "More than a fiscal crisis, Paraguay suffers from a harsh case of lack of imports, as the few goods imported to South America rarely reach the nation."
PAR_bm_selfsuf1_desc:0 "After a series of decisive measures, we have finally re-gained out capacity to acquiring goods and started making said goods in our nation. We are taking the first steps towards true independence, as painful as they are"
PAR_bm_selfsuf2_desc:0 "We have reached industrial output levels high enough for the government to declare our programs a success. An empty boast when it comes to most metrics, but one that increases national morale and thus increased spending in the short turn, as the people regained faith in the economy and the state recovered much of its losses"
PAR_slash_desc:0 "Harsh budget cuts were the way chosen to deal with our budgetary issues. It wont go well with the military whose pensions are at risk..."
PAR_agriprotecc_desc:0 "Paraguayan farmers now have proper protection against the flood of cheap foreign foodstuffs that threatened them"
PAR_desu_vult_desc:0 "Our land was always a bastion of faith, defending the land from the greedy hands of our neighbours. The church's close relation with our regime ensures that the people knows who's in the right at all times"
PAR_cav_desc:0 "Trucks can be faster, but yoy just cant trust the infrastructure deep in the South of the world. Sometimes, a position needs to be reinforced, and hasitily so, and our horsemen also can use their mobilty offensively with their new funding and training"
PAR_specforcetraining_desc:0 "A few veterans of the War have been training new, elite forces that will spearhead our assaults against the enemies of the nation"
PAR_elite_army_desc:0 "Truly with no equal, Paraguay is now truly an Army with a State, as its military forces have achieved such hegemony over all matters, and such mastery of their local warfare, its doubtful for its legacy to fade away"
PAR_no_pasaran_desc:0 "Those who fought for our nation, even against unimaginable odds; Those who fought against Bolivian agression and foreign plots, they know what its stake and will never give up as long the fight can continue!"
PAR_everymanasoldier_desc:0 "Every man is ready to do his duty, and to die for the nation. Paraguay will never again be at the mercy of foreigners, who plot to keep our mighty people under their thumb!"
PAR_everymanasoldier2_desc:0 "Every man is ready to do his duty, and to die for the nation. Paraguay will never again be at the mercy of foreigners, who plot to keep our mighty people under their thumb!"
PAR_training_desc:0 "Strict regimens and expanded funding ensure that we can send every able bodied man to the field with proper training"
PAR_planning_bonus_desc:0 "Our expert and veteran generals have much experience in planning and preparing offensives, but now they have the proper tools and are accustomed to planning war against actual foes, not just Bolivians"
PAR_exportseffort_desc:0 "Our economy should not be isolated, and we should not hesitate to help our neighbours to recover. The profits we get by fuffiling their import demands are nothing but byproducts of being a good neighbour, wishing prosperity for the continent"
PAR_freedom_desc:0 "The rampant nationalist zeal in our country came from more than a lack of faith in common politicans, but the utter failure of our nation to properly protect individuals and free entreprise, leading to war and unrest. Part of these fall on our inability to correct our constitution and move way from the shadowy delusions of leftist vultures"
PAR_shock_et_awe_desc:0 "Paraguayan general staff knows that it's unfeasible to stay on the defensive forever, and have more experience in modern war than most armies. The current shift towards offensive policies comes from years of debates and developments, but currently its fair to asses it's the predominant school of thought"
PAR_doctrine_review_desc:0 "The best way to learn is by studying your own mistakes. Via constant reviewing and advancing, we will always ensure that our forces are neither outdated or predictable"
PAR_your_new_empire_desc:0 "José Felix Estigarribia's control over Paraguay is nigh absolute. Its essentially"
PAR_PUS_IDEA_desc:0 "Heavily influenced by the ideas of US senator Huey Long, but with an unique militaristic spin, the Estigarribia goverment has changes its goverment to its core, and the power of the president is almost unchecked"
PAR_well_ran_budget_desc:0 "After harsh cuts, we have, at least, managed to gain some degree of budgetary relief. Now this austerity must be maintained at all costs"
PAR_fowardthinking_desc:0 "If our nation is to move foward in any way, we must ensure that those with the minds and qualification to take it there are properly funded and promoted"
PAR_better_pensions_desc:0 "After a gruesome period of budgetary reform, Pensions for veterans and other vital state personnel now have sustainable rates"
PAR_operational_autonomy_desc:0 "We may be small, but our reach to strike back is vast, for our planes are designed, and pilots trained, to keep the fight abroad"
PAR_workersofthehomefront_desc:0 "Every person must do their part for the state. Everyone will work to aid us the way they can, and the brave Women of Paraguay will hel supply our brave armies"

PAR_self_sufficency:0 "자급자족"
PAR_self_sufficency_desc:0 "Paraguay's economy is in shables, but its potential isn't. We should mobilize our budget in order to start massive industrial, agricultural and infrastructural projects. Paraguay's economy shall become self-sufficient so that we can exploit its full potential."
PAR_build_buildsake:0 "산업기반 건설"
PAR_build_buildsake_desc:0 "While South America in general has an undevelopped industrial base, Paraguay's industry is even weaker. We need to construct new industrial complexes and for industrial purposes suited railways and roads in order to develop our industrial base."
PAR_incentivize:0 "민간산업 보조금"
PAR_incentivize_desc:0 "The state is mighty and powerful, but it can't do everything by itself either. We need to promote private entreprises and investments so that our industry can grow faster. Surely, if we give investors advantages, they will invest in our economy."
PAR_agrieffort:0 "농업에 노력"
PAR_agrieffort_desc:0 "A strong industrial base is vital for a modern economy, but we shouldn't ignore all those who won't build toasters, tanks and trucks. We need to set up agricultural subsidies and agricultural institutions which help our rural farming population."
PAR_protectionism:0 "보호주의"
PAR_protectionism_desc:0 "Our economy doesn't only suffer from underdevelopment, it also suffers from cheap foreign competition. How are we supposed to sell our goods if foreign goods are cheaper? We need to protect our economy from the evil world!"
PAR_factorio:0 "수입품 대체 계획"
PAR_factorio_desc:0 "A self-sufficient economy can't rely on imports, that's self-explanatory. We should find ways to avoid importing goods, we need to substitute everything that isn't made in Paraguay."
PAR_factory:0 "진보한 산업"
PAR_factory_desc:0 "Thanks to both the state and the people, our economy is quickly developping. Factories now stand there where nothing had stood before, and 'Made in Paraguay' is now omnipresent in our shops. Our industry is advancing quickly, and so should our technology."

PAR_indistrial_selfsufficiency_desc:0 "Our self-sufficiency plan works, that's for sure! Paraguay's economy now relies much less on imports and our manufacturing section is growing daily. 'Made in Paraguay' really does work."

PAR_slash_debt:0 "예산 삭감"
PAR_slash_debt_desc:0 "Our state spends too much money, way too much money. We need to make cuts everywhere and anywhere if we wish to avoid bankruptcy. Most Paraguayans, from bureaucrats to veterans, won't be too happy with this, but we don't want to end up like the French in 1789, now do we?"
PAR_national_liberalism:0 "경제적 자유주의"
PAR_national_liberalism_desc:0 "The state can't play god, that is a sad reality. Instead of handing over the economy to the bureaucrats, we need to liberalize it in favour of private entreprise and economic freedom."
PAR_export_focus_economy:0 "수출중심 경제"
PAR_export_focus_economy_desc:0 "The Paraguayan market is quite small, but the German market isn't. In order to maximize the strength and the profits of the Paraguayan economy, we need to augment the exportation of Paraguayan goods to the whole world."

PAR_commonsense_pensions_desc:0 "No one would dare to cut all pensions, but at the same time our pension system is underfunded and we can't afford to spend more money. In these times of needs, we need some commonsense policies regarding our pension system."

par.1.d:0 "3국 동맹의 파괴적인 전쟁 후에, 파라과이는 거의 알아볼 수 없을 정도로 부서지고 깨졌습니다. 파라과이는 대부분의 남성 인구가 죽고 고아들이 생겨났습니다. 그리고 브라질과 아르헨티나 모두 과라니 공화국의 영토를 빼앗았으나 양국 간의 완충국으로서의 주권을 효과적으로 유지했기 때문에 극심한 인구 및 경제적 피해가 피해의 전부는 아니었습니다. 그 재난을 복구하고 회복하는 것은 쉬운 일이 아니었고, 정치적 불안은 여전히 나라를 부식시켰습니다. 1904년, 콜로라도당의 통치에 반대하는 자유주의 혁명이 일어났습니다. 자유당 통치는 1922년 경쟁 관계에 있는 정당간의 내전으로 정점을 찍은 정치적 불안의 시기를 시작했습니다. 그리고, 1929년 말에, 전쟁은 다시 볼리비아와 손을 잡고 파라과이에 왔습니다. 차코 지역의 유정을 확보하라는 경제적인 압력을 받고 있는 그 나라는 분쟁 지역에서 적극적으로 자신의 주장을 주장하기 시작했습니다. 차코 전쟁은 4년이 걸렸고, 1933년까지 파라과이는 볼리비아 군대를 완전히 격파하고 그들의 땅을 차지하기 시작했습니다. 하지만 늘어나는 부채와 군비가 정부에게 계속 부담이 되고 있기 때문에, 전쟁의 승리는 비용 없이 이루어지지 않았습니다. 볼리비아군은 장비도 제대로 갖추지 못했고, 전투 훈련도 제대로 받지 못했고, 사기도 낮아 파라과이의 사상자는 훨씬 적었습니다. 그러나 정국은 나아지지 않았고 자유주의 통치는 흔들리고 있었습니다. 라파엘 프랑코와 다른 급진 지도자들은 1934년 좌파 권위주의 원칙에 따라 쿠데타를 일으켰지만, 차코 전쟁의 영웅 호세 펠릭스 에스티가리비아에 의해 3개월이라는 짧은 통치로 물러났습니다. 이제, 자유주의 혼란의 시대는 끝났고, 호세 펠릭스의 통치는 위대한 평화로써의 하나입니다. 그가 '생디칼리스트' 프랑코와 볼리비아의 침략자들에 대한 그의 행동은, 거의 만장일치로 국가 구세주이자 영웅으로 칭송 받고 있기 때문에, 정치에 큰 영향을 미칩니다. 아르헨티나 애국당의 부상과 함께, 에스티가리비아와 그의 내각은 다시 초긴장 상태에 빠졌습니다. 마누엘 카를레스가 그 나라의 지도부에 오르자 그의 팽창주의 목표를 숨기려 하지 않기 때문에, 곧 파라과이에 다시 한번 전쟁이 일어날지도 모릅니다."
