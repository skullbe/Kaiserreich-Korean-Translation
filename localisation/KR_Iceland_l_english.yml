#Intro Events#

ice.9996.t:0 "1922년 아이슬란드"
ice.9996.d:0 "1874년에 탄생한 아이슬란드는 덴마크가 식민지에게 자치와 헌법을 부여했을 때 처음으로 독립을 맛보았습니다. 덴마크의 일부로서, 아이슬란드는 세계대전 기간 동안 중립을 지켰습니다. 종전 이후 아이슬란드는 종주국 덴마크와 함께 미텔오이로파 경제블록과 합류했습니다. 이것은 아이슬란드가 주요 수출품인 어류로 두 시장에 진출할 수 있었기 때문에 이 섬나라에 번영의 시기를 가져다 주었습니다. 영국은 두 섬 사이의 거리 때문에 아이슬란드에서 수익성이 좋은 생선 수입을 계속했습니다. 한편, 아이슬란드 대구의 유럽 시장 진출은 아이슬란드 경제를 활성화시키기 위한 적은 추가 자금의 원천이 되었습니다."
ice.9996.a:0 "한때는 그랬지..."

ice.9997.t:0 "1925년 아이슬란드"
ice.9997.d:0 "그러나 이러한 경제적 번영은 영원히 지속되지 않았습니다. 1925년 영국 혁명은 종전 후 아이슬란드가 겪고 있던 기적을 산산조각 냈습니다. 충성파가 제국 구석구석까지 달아나자 영국-아이슬란드 무역은 순식간에 물거품이 되었습니다. 대구 무역이 가능할 유일한 나라는 왕족들이 도망간 캐나다였지만 그들은 아이슬란드 무역 재개보다 더 시급한 경제 문제를 가지고 있었습니다. 그러므로, 미텔오이로파 경제 정책이 생디칼리슴 국가들과 어떤 무역도 할 수 없다고 명령한 이후 아이슬란드는 영국 혁명의 여파로 비틀거리고 있었습니다."
ice.9997.a:0 "이젠 아니야..."

ice.9998.t:0 "1932년 아이슬란드"
ice.9998.d:0 "이 나라에서 증가하기 시작한 대규모 실업률에 미봉책을 마련하기 위해, 국회는 사람들이 육체 노동 건설 프로젝트에 종사하도록 하기 위해 도시 일자리 증가 계획을 만들었습니다. 이것은 한동안 효과가 있었지만 결국 정부 내 정당들 사이에서 불화의 원인이 되었습니다. 1932년 11월 9일 시의회 회의에서 시의회는 그 사업의 추진에 대해 토론했습니다. 경제 불황이 여전히 아이슬란드를 괴롭히고 있다는 사실 때문에 이 계획이 그대로 유지될 것을 요구하며 건물 앞에서 폭동을 일으키기 위해 집단으로 도착한 사람들에게 이 소식이 전해졌습니다. 이 폭동은 구토우슬라구린으로 알려지게 되었고, 도시 일자리 증가 계획이 가까운 미래에 효력을 발휘하도록 했습니다."
ice.9998.a:0 "이 위기가 과연 끝날까?"

ice.9999.t:0 "1936년 아이슬란드"
ice.9999.d:0 "지난 10년은 아이슬란드 사람들에게 재앙이었지만, 여전히 지평선 너머로 더 밝은 미래에 대한 희망이 남아 있습니다. 유망한 정부 관리들은 일자리를 제공하거나 관광 산업을 일으키거나 심지어 우리 섬이 우리에게 제공하는 지열과 수력 발전 자원을 활용하는 것을 검토하기 위해 대규모 공공 사업 계획을 짜기 시작했습니다. 아마도 덴마크의 약간의 도움을 받으면, 우리는 이러한 꿈을 이룰 수 있을 것입니다!"
ice.9999.a:0 "아마도 끝이 머지 않았다!"

#Cod War Events#
ice.1.t:0 "아이슬란드가 어장을 확장하다"
ice.1.d:0 "최근의 정책 변화로, 우리 어부들은 이제 어장이 훨씬 더 넓어졌습니다. 이것은 우리의 이익을 큰 폭으로 증가시킬 것으로 예상됩니다. 그러기 위해 우리 상인들은 이미 대영제국의 옛 교역 상대국들을 향해 우리가 할 수 있는 경제 거래가 있는지 살펴보기 시작했습니다."
ice.1.a:0 "What a bountiful catch!"

ice.2.t:0 "아이슬란드가 어장을 확장하다"
ice.2.d:0 "아이슬란드는 최근 북대서양의 상당 부분을 그들의 정당한 어장으로 주장했습니다. 이것은 브리튼에서 생디칼리스트들의 분노를 끌어낼 수 밖에 없지만, 이 기회를 이용해 아이슬란드에서 지지를 얻어 궁극적으로 고향 제도의 탈활을 위한 집결지로 사용할 수 있을 것입니다."
ice.2.a:0 "아이슬란드에 거래를 제안해라"
ice.2.b:0 "우리는 위험을 감수하기 싫다"

ice.3.t:0 "아이슬란드가 브리튼 바다에 침범하다!"
ice.3.d:0 "아이슬란드인들은 북대서양에 있는 우리 해역에 침범했습니다. 그들은 검은 월요일의 여파를 극복하기 위해 노력할 뿐이라고 주장하지만 그럼에도 불구하고 그들은 북쪽에 있는 스코틀랜드 어부들로부터 불안을 야기시켰습니다. 아이슬란드는 작으며 그들이 어떤 물고기를 낚든 우리에게 그리 큰 영향을 미치지는 않을 것입니다. 그러나 혁명 전에 두 대서양 섬이 공유했던 무역 협정을 다시 맺을 기회가 있습니다."
ice.3.a:0 "거래를 시도하자"
ice.3.b:0 "바다에는 물고기들이 아주 많다"

ice.4.t:0 "캐나다가 거래를 제안하다"
ice.4.d:0 "캐나다 상인들은 우리 두 나라 사이의 경제 거래에 관심을 표명하기 위해 우리와 접촉했습니다. 대영제국의 최대 후계국으로서, 그들은 한때 우리 섬들이 공유했던 무역을 재개하기를 희망합니다."
ice.4.a:0 "오타와의 우리 친구들!"

ice.5.t:0 "브리튼 연방이 거래를 제안하다"
ice.5.d:0 "브리튼 연방의 상인 연합은 잠재적인 경제 거래 조건을 논의하기 위해 우리에게 왔습니다. 우리 두 섬은 과거에 관대한 무역 거래를 한 적이 있지만, 지난 10년간의 최근 사건들은 그 거래의 종식을 초래했습니다. 그들은 지금이 그 거래를 갱신하기에 완벽한 시기라고 주장합니다."
ice.5.a:0 "섬나라끼리 다시 무역하자!"

ice.6.t:0 "아이슬란드가 여러 무역 제의를 받다"
ice.6.d:0 "최근 확장으로 대서양 양안의 강대국들은 자신들의 몫을 차지하기 위해 경쟁하고 있습니다. 캐나다와 브리튼 연방 모두 증가하는 대구 공급에 대한 새로운 거래를 제안했습니다. 어느 쪽과 무역협정을 맺어야 할까요?" 
ice.6.a:0 "캐나다와 거래한다."
ice.6.b:0 "브리튼 연방과 거래한다."

ice.7.t:0 "아이슬란드와 맺은 대구 무역 협정"
ice.7.d:0 "우리 상인들은 아이슬란드와의 거래를 성공적으로 성사시켰습니다. 이 거래는 그들이 경기 침체에서 벗어나 북대서양에서 귀중한 동맹국을 얻는 데 도움이 될 것입니다."
ice.7.a:0 "대서양 횡단 대구 무역이 시작되었다!"

ice.8.t:0 "캐나다와의 대구 무역이 서명되다"
ice.8.d:0 "캐나다가 우리의 대구 판매에 동의하였습니다. 우리는 이제 이익이 상당히 증가할 것입니다."
ice.8.a:0 "A Sweet Catch"

ice.9.t:0 "아이슬란드-캐나다 무역이 서명되다"
ice.9.d:0 "왕당파는 아이슬란드 지역 주민들과 우리 바다에서 낚시를 하고 우리 소유의 물고기를 잡을 것을 권장하는 계약을 체결했습니다. 우리는 보복하거나 이런 작은 나라로부터 멸시당하는 굴욕을 당해야 합니다."
ice.9.a:0 "Contest the Waters!"

ice.10.t:0 "아이슬란드와 맺은 대구 무역 협정"
ice.10.d:0 "아이슬란드 상인들은 우리 두 나라가 과거에 공유했던 무역을 재개하기로 결정했습니다. 우리 섬들의 미래를 함께 번영시킵시다."
ice.10.a:0 "대서양 대구 무역이 시작되었다!"

ice.11.t:0 "대서양 대구 무역이 서명되다!"
ice.11.d:0 "이 거래의 서명과 함께, 연방은 새로운 어획물 중 상당 부분을 넘기는 대가로 우리가 그들의 수역을 침범했다는 문제를 뒤로 하기로 합의했습니다. 이것은 우리 어부들에게 더 안전한 환경을 제공할 것입니다."
ice.11.a:0 "우리의 대서양 동맹을 위해!"

ice.12.t:0 "브리튼인들이 아이슬란드인들과 거래하다"
ice.12.d:0 "Those dastardly Unionists in England have struck a deal with Iceland for almost a complete monopoly on the cod sales gathered from the North Atlantic. We can't let that happen! Should we offer Iceland a new deal or quietly back down?"

In an act of desperation, the commander of the Ægir gave the order to man the guns, in spite of the overwhelming firepower advantage that the Dunedin had at her disposal. Serviceman Guðmundur Kjærnested manned the 6 pounder to deter the Dunedin from finishing the fleeing patrol vessel off.

Our brave submarine crew operating underneath Holbrook took to the sea and carefully made their way to the harbour where the Canadian fleet was docked for the night. Due to the lax nature of the recent conflict in the Atlantic, there seemed to be no real attempt to post adequate sentries to stand guard against something like this. As Holbrook surfaced he fired two salvoes of torpedoes into the HMCS Cumberland. The first salvo was ineffective, bouncing off the hull, but the second salvo ripped a massive hole into the starboard hull immediately causing it to list over and begin to flood. Following this display of fireworks, Holbrook and his crew submerged and began their escape back to the safety of English waters."

To that end, it is time to consider cutting back on the austerity budget that we have imposed on our people.

ice.110.a:0 "캐나다 왕실 기술자들에게 줄서보자."

ice.111.t:0 "캐나다 수비대의 힘을 요청하다"
ice.111.d:0 "우리는 브리튼 연방에서 멀지 않습니다. 우리가 브리튼의 침공을 알아차릴때쯤 캐나다군이 핼리팩스나 뉴펀들랜드에서 개입하는 것은 너무 늦을지도 모릅니다. 대신 우리는 우리가 브리튼으로부터 섬을 방어하는 것을 돕기 위해 군대를 미리 보내줄 것을 요청해야 합니다."
ice.111.a:0 "Z Force를 요청한다"

ice.113.t:0 "Request reinforcements for the IRAF"

ice.150.t:0 "도로의 상태"
ice.150.d:0 "아이슬란드는 해안에서 보트를 이용해 대부분의 활동이 이루어졌기 때문에 도로는 최우선 순위가 아니었습니다. 아이슬란드가 현대화를 시도함에 따라, 우리의 도로는 그 후진성을 보여주고 있습니다. 그 섬에 존재하는 몇 안 되는 도로는 일년동안 짧은 기간동안만 이용 가능하고 극도로 열악한 상태에 있습니다."
ice.150.a:0 "우리는 무언가 해야 한다"

ice.151.t:0 "온수 배관"
ice.151.d:0 "최근 아이슬란드에 있었던 발전은 레이캬비크의 일부 지역에 온수관을 설치하는 것이었습니다. 몇 년 전 한 농부가 자신의 집에 증기를 끌어들이기 위해 배관을 설치했을 때 그 발전은 빠르게 퍼져나갔습니다. 학교와 병원들이 온수의 혜택을 처음으로 받은 건물이었지만, 온수 시스템은 이제 사람들의 집까지 확산되고 있습니다. 곧 우리 섬 아래의 풍부한 열천을 이용해 도시 전체가 안심하고 온탕에서 목욕할 수 있을 것입니다."
ice.151.a:0 "온수는 우리 마음도 따뜻하게 해준다"

ice.170.t:0 "게이시르(아이슬란드의 유명한 간헐천) 기증"
ice.170.d:0 "아이슬란드는 화산섬의 특징 때문에 생긴 인기있는 간헐천이 많습니다. 이전에 이 간헐천은 숨겨져 있었고 간헐천이 분출하는 것을 보고 싶어하는 사람들로부터 돈을 벌기 위한 사업 아이템으로 사용되었습니다. 나라의 자선단체에 영감을 받아, 간헐천의 주인은 울타리를 없애고 간헐천을 아이슬란드 사람들에게 영구적으로 기부했습니다!"
ice.170.a:0 "가장 후한 기증이다"

ice.171.t:0 "수력발전소의 개장"
ice.171.d:0 "Today marks the completion of the Laxárstöð Hydroelectric Plant. This singular plant has the capacity to quadruple our local power production on the island. May this new achievement help drive the recovery of our people and propel us to new and greater heights!"
ice.171.a:0 "더 밝은 미래를 위해!"

ice.172.t:0 "Hummock studies"
ice.172.d:0 "Scientists continue to study the effects that these grassy 'bumps' or hummocks have on the soil.

ice.173.t:0 "Farming Communities"
ice.173.d:0 "Small farming communities have started to be examined by government officials in search of ways that they could be managed better during these trying times. Communities who are performing well enough will be given a small tax exemption to encourage others to follow suit and run their farms more efficiently."
ice.173.a:0 "For efficiency!"

ice.174.t:0 "Packing the barrels"
ice.174.d:0 "A crucial part of the export business is the packing of barrels of fish to be sent abroad and sold. We must invest in proper infrastructure to make sure that we don't run into any bottlenecks due to overcrowding on the docks."
ice.174.a:0 "Pack em' in and roll em' out"

ice.175.t:0 "A new source of power"
ice.175.d:0 "Engineers in Iceland have come forward with ideas to bring large amounts of power to the island to help with industrialization. The bountiful rivers and waterfalls carry an immense amount of energy that just passes us by. If we could create dams in some of our rivers, we might be able to harness Mother Nature's gift for our benefit."
ice.175.a:0 "An untapped spring"

ice.176.t:0 "Expansion of Vestmannaeyjar"
ice.176.d:0 "As the fishing industry grows, so too do the towns that support such businesses. While the harbour is too shallow for larger more modern vessels, the coastal town of Heimaey remains a crucial part of the cod fishing industry that is run off of the southern coast of Iceland. Already efforts are underway to streamline the transfer of catches from newer vessels to smaller ships that can bring the haul to the city for processing."
ice.176.a:0 "This can only grow busier"

ice.177.t:0 "A modern fleet"
ice.177.d:0 "The smaller ships that we have used in the past can not hope to handle the amount of fish that Iceland needs to recover from Black Monday. We must invest in larger vessels that are better suited for keeping up with the demands of the modern era."

#1937 Vote#
ice.250.t:0 "1937년 국민투표"
ice.250.d:0 "덴마크의 지배를 끝내기 위한 투표를 할 때가 왔습니다. 최근의 경제위기 동안 아이슬란드 국민들을 돕는 것에 대한 부적절한 대응은 덴마크 통치에 대한 국민들의 불만을 증폭시켰고, 독립 열망은 계속 커지고 있습니다. 여론조사가 막바지에 다다르면서, 결과는 독립을 가리키고 있습니다."
ice.250.a:0 "독립 아이슬란드를 위해!"
ice.250.b:0 "덴마크의 영향권에 잔류하자!"

ice.251.t:0 "독립파가 승리했다!"
ice.251.d:0 "최근 덴마크로부터의 독립 투표의 승리와 함께, 의회는 장관들의 정당 바꾸기로 혼란합니다. 한 가지 분명한 것은 독립 연합 당원 수의 증가입니다."
ice.251.a:0 "더욱 영광스러운 시간을 위해!"

ice.252.t:0 "덴마크에 충성하자"
ice.252.d:0 "No matter the economic crisis that has polarized many on the isle, Icelanders are not a rebellious people. We will do our part as a constituent of the Kingdom of Denmark to care for our corner of the realm without cutting ties with the rest. This has unfortunately had the effect of radicalizing part of the hardline independence wing."

ice.254.t:0 "아이슬란드가 미텔오이로파를 떠났다"
ice.254.d:0 "The people of Iceland have elected to leave the Mitteleuropan sphere and attempt to forge a new web of independent trade. This could be an opportunity for us to find an ally closer to the home isles."

ice.255.t:0 "아이슬란드가 미텔오이로파를 떠났다"
ice.255.d:0 "The people of Iceland have elected to leave the Mitteleuropan sphere and attempt to forge a new web of independent trade. This could be an opportunity for us to find an ally closer to the royalists in exile."

ice.256.t:0 "아이슬란드가 덴마크와의 동군연합을 끝내기로 결정했다"
ice.256.d:0 "After the Weltkrieg, in 1921, Iceland, at the time fully part of Denmark was given its independence, under personal union with Denmark and with Denmark taking care of Iceland's foreign policy until possible revision by plebiscite in 1946, 25 years after Iceland's independence. As such, they came along into Mitteleuropa and they remained in general in a course with us. However, Iceland's position makes their Mitteleuropa membership less than ideal, and as such, the island declined over the years. Under the dissent that this caused, Icelandic politicians had expedited the referendum, and the Icelandic people elected to end our relationship. A republic will be declared in Reykjavik and Iceland has let us know that they no longer need our foreign ministry to treat Icelanders as if they were Danes."
ice.256.a:0 "So be it"

As such, they came along into Mitteleuropa and they remained in general in a course with us. However, Iceland's position makes their Mitteleuropa membership less than ideal, and as such, the island declined over the years.

ice.300.t:0 "은행 개혁"
ice.300.d:0 "The current situation in Iceland does not suit anyone as the banking system has completely failed following the disaster of Black Monday. Two camps have formed which argue too separate views for how the banks should be rebuilt. One group believes that the only way forward is through a strong centrally planned bank, while the other argues that a series of separate specialized banks are how the people of Iceland will recover best from this crisis. Which group should we endorse?"

ice.301.t:0 "Purchasing a new design"

ice.350.d:0 "Our forces on Iceland have intercepted a radio signal broadcasting to the locals in an attempt to antagonize their view of us. We know that they lack the means to drive us off the island so should we let them talk or shall we bulk up our forces slightly?"
ice.350.a:0 "Authorize an additional force"
ice.350.b:0 "What could they do?"

ice.600.t:0 "Cutting the tape at the new factory"
