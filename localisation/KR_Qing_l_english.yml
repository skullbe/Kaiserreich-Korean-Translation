POLITICS_PUYI_PUPPET_DESC:0 "'His Imperial Majesty, the Son of Heaven, the Xuantong Emperor’ - while Pu Yi holds many titles, the young Emperor has little power, and has never really possessed any ever since his birth in 1906. Deposed in the Xinhai revolution at the age of 5, he was returned to the throne as a condition of the German intervention in China, a move detested by the general population. With day-to-day governance largely handled by the civil government in Beijing, he has spent the last decade idly sitting in the Forbidden City, occupying his days with tennis matches and calligraphy. But the Xuantong Emperor may secretly harbor ambitions to restore China and his dynasty to the greatness they enjoyed centuries ago..."
POLITICS_PUYI_RESTORED_DESC:0 "Restored following what has now been deemed the Manchu Coup, Aisin-Gioro Puyi now sits at the helm of a government scrubbed clear of warlord influences. While some observers fear a return to traditionalism, the new Qing government seems to push for a much more modern style of rule. Puyi himself still lacks much power, but this is of his own design. Fearing a tyrannical descendant of the same type that doomed his predecessors, the Emperor and legal scholars have drafted a constitutional structure of monarchy where Puyi exercises spiritual and patriotic power while only having an advisory role in legislature and day-to-day governing. While this new structure of government is untested, it seems strong, and many in China and around the world are hoping Puyi can lead the nation into this brave new world."
POLITICS_PUYI_RESTORED__YIGUANDAO_DESC:0 "While many around China and the world hoped that the so-called Manchu Coup would restore some semblance of constitutional monarchy to China, the scheming machinations of Honoured Teacher Zhang Tianran have buried any and all aspirations for modern imperial rule. With religious devotees rapidly filling all governmental posts and seizing control of the military, Puyi has been pushed back into a position of irrelevance, now answering to the beck and call of a religious cult rather than a military clique. His role remains relatively unchanged from the days of Wu Peifu, only now with more obscure religious rituals and less military reviews. Puyi himself seems to not mind very much, having completely fallen under the sway of the teachings of Zhang and the Yiguandao."
POLITICS_WU_PEIFU_DESC:0 "Narrowly escaping death at the hands of Puyi, Pujie, and the other Manchu noblemen who plotted to overthrow the Zhili clique, Wu Peifu has now dropped any facade of Imperial rule over China. Naming himself ‘interim head of the nation’, he is now tasked with building a legitimate system of government for his nation. A military man for his entire life, Wu is not expected to remain in power for long, and transfer control of the country to a hand-picked successor."
POLITICS_HU_SHIH_DESC:0 "A political philosopher and intellectual, Hu Shih may seem like an odd choice for first president of the ‘Beijing Government of the Republic of China’. Yet the political philosophy he developed, ‘pragmatism’, was deeply influential to Wu Peifu during the years immediately following the restoration of the Qing, and the two frequently met in Hu’s office at Peking University, discussing how both men, former republicans, could and should dedicate themselves to the imperial project as the ‘least bad’ option for China. But with the Manchu’s tyranny revealed, Wu has selected Hu to lead the new government, hoping that the philosopher’s writings and public persona can lend an air of legitimacy to a government seen by most as a sham and a front for the Zhili clique."
POLITICS_WELLINGTON_KOO_DESC:0 "V. K. Wellington Koo, or Gu Weijun as he is known in China, is one of the nation’s foremost diplomats and statesmen. Influential in the negotiations surrounding the end of the Weltkrieg, during the Imperial restoration he served as ambassador to the United States. Recalled due to escalating political tensions, Wu has now appointed him president of the ‘Beijing Government of the Republic of China’, hoping his diplomatic skills can help in achieving international legitimacy and recognition."

QIE_WU_PEIFU_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nApril 22nd, 1874\nPenglai, Shandong, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn in Shandong to a merchant family, Wu entered the Baoding military academy and quickly rose through the ranks of the new Beiyang army. Following the collapse of the Republic of China in 1916 he aligned himself with Feng Guozhang’s Zhili clique, and following Feng’s death in 1919 he rose to dominate the clique, leading it to victory over its main rival, the Fengtian clique, in 1928, despite being betrayed by his former ally Feng Yuxiang. During these turbulent years he was mentored by Cao Kun, former and future president of the Assembly, who taught him the intriguing and scheming skills he used to seize control over the government. Although opposed to the reimposition of the Manchu monarchy by Germany, Wu has quickly adapted the Zhili clique to China’s new governmental structure, sidelining the Manchu and ensuring that he and his allies dominated nearly every facet of government. A token opposition was allowed to exist, but Wu truly controls the government.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nWu reportedly owns the world's largest diamond, but has refused to allow anyone to verify this claim.\nWas once renowned for hang a photograph of George Washington behind his desk, but due to the ongoing political turmoil in the United States he has replaced this with a photograph of Bismarck. 'A great political thinker, just like Washington', Wu said to a visiting journalist, ignoring any questions about his relationship with Germany."
QIE_JIANG_BAILI_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1882\nHaining, Zhejiang, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn into a relatively prosperous family, Jiang entered the Qing civil service in his youth and attended Tsinghua University, graduating in 1901. He studied in Japan, returning in 1910 for a brief stint in governance before going abroad again, this time to Germany. He served in Yuan Shikai’s government before he declared himself emperor, a decision Jiang strongly opposed. Following the collapse of Yuan’s ‘Empire’, he began working with Wu Peifu, becoming a close confidant and assisting him in defeating the Fengtian clique in 1928. He has become a close ally of Wu, and has spent most of the early 1930’s attempting to prepare the country against the threat of Japanese invasion, something he sees as an inevitability.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nSkilled military theorist, and has written several works on defensive strategy, though several have criticised him of stealing ideas from his subordinates."
QIE_WANG_HUAIQING_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1875\nNingjin, Zhili, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nWhile Wang was born into an upper-middle class family of bureaucrats in 1875, his father’s alcoholism and gambling drove the family into poverty. Wang left his family and joined the military at a young age, helping suppress revolts in 1905 and becoming a confidante of Yuan Shikai. When Shikai’s restoration fell apart, Wang allied himself with the Zhili clique, becoming a close confidante of Cao Kun and Wu Peifu. Though he nominally commands several divisions of troops under the Qing command structure, he essentially uses these armies as thuggish extortionists, demanding outrageous 'protection' fees from towns near his troops garrisons.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nKnown affectionately as the 'toilet general' by his troops. There are two theories for this unique monicker: The first is that he loves his own toilet so much he orders it to be carried with him on campign at all times, where it served as a makeshift standard. In one story of dubious veracity, he launched an attack on a mountain fortification sitting atop his toilet, stamped with the Chinese character for 'Wang'. His troops faltered once the toilet vanished in the chaos of battle, but Wang and his men lifted the toilet aloft, ralling his troops and (supposedly) inspiring them to climb up a sheer cliff and seize the bastion. Furthermore, he apparently even uses a toilet in lieu of an office chair at his desk. The second (and more plausible) explanation for the nickname is that his troops are unwashed and smell like toilets, as Wang believes peasant soldiers taken right from the fields are more honest and loyal."
QIE_ZAITAO_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nJune 23rd, 1887\nBeijing, Qing Empire \n§YMilitary Career:§L\nAisin-Gioro Zaitao, uncle of Puyi, was born into a life of privilege and wealth enjoyed by few in China. The younger brother of the Guangxu Emperor, he was acquainted with a baby Puyi while he was a teenager. Rising through the ranks of the Manchu nobility due to his family ties, he was promoted to Inspector General in 1909 before embarking on a tour of the world in 1910, and attended the funeral of King George V in 1911. Appointed head of the Imperial Guard upon his return, Zaitao served until 1912, when Puyi was overthrown. Briefly restored to the position in 1917, he was immediately removed once Zhang Xun’s restoration attempt failed. He finally returned to the post in 1927 with the German re-imposition of Puyi to the throne. One of the founding members of the Manchu Party, Zaitao is more open to reform than most older Manchu nobility, having travelled around the world extensively in his youth. An excellent horsemen, he has become interested in armored warfare in recent years due to its potential battlefield applications.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nIn his spare time he enjoys horse riding, martial arts, and Beijing-style opera."
QIE_PUJIE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nApril 16th, 1907\nBeijing, Qing Empire \n§YMilitary Career:§L\nThe brother of Aisin-Gioro Puyi, Pujie spent his childhood as a playmate to his brother, who was notorious for his temper tantrums and pampered nature. A well-known incident recounted how Puyi threw a tantrum when he saw that the inner lining of one of Pujie's coats was yellow, because yellow was traditionally a colour reserved only for the emperor. Following the Restoration in 1927, Pujie attended university in Berlin, where he was given the nickname 'Peter' by his classmates, as they found Pujie too difficult to pronounce. Despite growing up in the shadow of his brother, Pujie rarely envied the Emperor, who was confined to pointless ceremonial duties and lacked much of an education beyond court formalities. Pujie, on the other hand, was exposed to the latest Western science, education, and culture. Dismayed by the moral laxness he found in Germany that sprung up following the horrors of the Weltkrieg, he returned to China impressed by Western science and industry, but wary of the libertine culture flourishing in Berlin. Furthermore, he was dismayed at the level of German control over the country, and especially despised the Zhili clique, whom he viewed as essentially holding his brother hostage. Largely resigned to a ceremonial position within the military, he plots to one day help his brother return to the rightful position on the throne, with him serving as a ‘guiding hand’, of course.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nHe has not married, despite rampant suspicion that the Emperor is infertile."
QIE_CAI_CHENGXUN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1871\nTianjin, Zhili, Qing Empire \n§YMilitary Career:§L\nA graduate of the Tianjin Wubei Academy, Cai Chengxun has served in the military since 1900, including a brief stint as military governor of Gansu, where he aligned himself with the Zhili Clique. Since the fourth Zhifeng war he has mainly concerned himself with guarding the northern frontier against Fengtian incursions.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nOnce built a residence and a ancestral hall in Tianjin and engaged in real estate, industrial investment and charity during his dismissal."
QIE_LIU_MENGGENG_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1881\nFuning, Zhili, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nA graduate of the Qing's Army Military Medical School, Liu grew close to many in the Zhili clique while serving in a variety of medical and health offices, culminating with him serving as dean of the Baoding Academy's Medical Academy. He has served as 'Minister of Health' in Beijing since 1931, and has proposed an ambitious and far-reaching military reform plan that encompasses a variety of medical reforms.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nHas close family ties to many in the Zhili clique, being a cousin of Cao Kun.\nHe is also the intelligence minister of Cao Kun and Zhili Clique."
QIE_WANG_CHENGBIN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nAugust 21st, 1874\nFengtian, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn into an ethnically Manchu family, Wang was one of Wu’s earliest allies, helping him suppress Zhang Xun’s abortive Manchu restoration in 1917. In 1923, he led the troops to surround the president Li Yuanhong at the Tianjin Railway Station. He took the presidential seal to helped Cao Kun become the president. In failing health, Chengbin has largely secluded himself from other Zhili generals, and many are concerned his death will expose deep divisions within the internal workings of the Clique and the Harmony Association.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nHe was the founder of Tianjing Clique, which belonged to the early branches of Zhili Clique with Wu Peifu's Luoyang Clique and Cao Kun's Baoding Clique."
QIE_GOBULO_RUNQI_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nJuly 8th, 1912\nBeijing, Republic of China\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn into a Manchu noble family with long ties to the Aisin-Gioro clan, Gobulo Runqi was born just after the Qing were overthrown for the first time. Interested in engineering as a child, Runqi entered adolescence as the German intervention in China reached its zenith. One of his most distinctive childhood memories was attending the wedding of his sister Wanrong to the exiled Emperor in the Tianjin concession at the age of 10. After the German intervention placed his brother-in-law back on the throne, Runqi learned German from the horde of businessmen and military attaches that descended on Beijing in the economic boom of the late 1920s and early 1930s. This culminated in him attending the Preußische Kriegsakademie in Berlin, where he picked up the German name ‘Ruprecht’. Returning to China in 1935 following a tour of Europe, Runqi developed a fascination with armoured warfare and mechanization, inspired Heinz Guderian, an instructor at the Akademie. He is somewhat more sympathetic to the Germans than other Manchu, but the decadence and moral laxness he observed in Berlin during the boom years of the late 1920s and early 30s prevented him from becoming a full Germanophile.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nIn Berlin he became obsessed wih American cinema, and he introduced the genre to his brother-in-law, the Emperor, also a fan of cinema in general.\nHas quite the media presence, and his dalliances with various Beijing opera singers have made him a favourite of tabloids."
QIE_ZHANG_QIHUANG_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1887\nYongfu, Guangxi, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nZhang Qihuang started his military career in Repulican forces in the south of China, rising quickly through the ranks, culminating with him serving as governor of Guandong. Once Yuan Shikai declared himself Emperor, however, he resigned in disgust and went to Shanghai. His brother introduced him to Wu Peifu, and the two quickly became close allies. He served as a dedicated advisor to Wu, and eventually was promoted to several independent army commands.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nA master fortune-teller and astrologer, known as "Iron Mouth." Wu Peifu rarely does anything without the advice of Zhang first."
QIE_LU_XIANGTING_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1880\nHejian, Zhili, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nA graduate of both the Baoding Academy and the Japanese Army Sergeant School, Lu was originally a subordinate governor in Sun Chuanfang's League of Eight Provinces, but Lu’s open disdain for Sun's cooperation with Germany and his hatred of foreign concessions lead to his dismissal by Sun. He instead chose to work with Wu Peifu instead. He has worked closely with Jiang Baili in drafting plans to deal with a Japanese invasion, as the only thing he despises more than the Germans is Japanese domination over Manchuria.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nStill maintains contact with many former subordinates in the League. Information gained from them is passed onto Wu and the rest of the Northern Zhili, giving them an inside look into Sun's government."
QIE_XIAO_YAONAN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1875\nHuanggang, Hubei, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn into an impoverished family of the rural gentry, Xiao was forced to turn away from his dreams of becoming an imperial official due to a lack of funds. Instead, he was selected by Zhang Zhidong to join his new Hubei Military Academy. Xiao graduated in 1909, and used connections to Cao Kun’s family to stay adrift in the turmoil of the Xinhai revolution, then using them to become governor of Hubei. He consolidated his rule over the province, and helped organize the ‘Hubei Generals’, an informal group of textile manufacturers, the main industry of Hubei. He narrowly survived an assassination attempt in 1926 carried out by enemies of Cao Kun, and was drawn further and further into the Zhili sphere during and after the German intervention. He still maintains his hold over Hubei, modernizing the province while still working with Beijing.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nHis connections within the 'Hubei Generals' give him a large amount of clout within Beijing, as Hubei is one of the few provinces that are industrially profitable."
QIE_LI_BINGZHI_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1887\nZhengding, Zhili, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nLi Bingzhi had a relatively normal military career for the period, attending and graduating from the Baoding academy in 1908.There became acquainted with several future Zhili clique members, and following the unrest in 1917 and 1918 he joined Wu Peifu’s circle as a chief of staff to Wu ally Zhang Fulai. Rising quickly through the ranks, Li is seen as a competent officer.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nHas well-known monarchist leanings, which alienated him from many former 'Republican' Zhili generals."
QIE_XIQIA_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nOctober 18th, 1883\nFengtian, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nA distant cousin of Puyi, Aisin-Gioro Xiqia was educated in Japan and served the Fengtian clique before the Restoration in 1927. Deserting with his mainly Manchu Kirin Provincial Army, he joined the Qing empire. One of the few Manchu generals to command large numbers of soldiers directly, he has an uneasy relationship with Wu Peifu and the Zhili clique, and is largely loyal to the Manchu party. \n§YImportant Notes:§L\nOne of the more traditionalist members of the Manchu Party."
QIE_CAO_SHIJIE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1882\nTianjin, Zhili, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nNephew to Cao Kun, Cao Shijie grew up in one of the most prominent and well-connected families in China. These ties helped him gain entrance to the Baoding military academy, and was selected to lead an elite group of troops picked out by Yuan Shikai. Following the 1917 uprising, Cao Shijie joined the Zhili Clique, and served as president of his uncle’s Presidential Guard after he bribed his way to the presidency in 1923. The scandal surrounding the Beijing Coup of 1924 pushed Shijie out of power, but in recent years he has regained prominence among Zhili generals.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nLike his uncle, he turned to heavy drinking following the shame associated with the Beijing Coup."
QIE_ZHANG_SHAOZENG_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nOctober 9th, 1879\nDacheng, Zhili, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nZhang entered the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1899 to learn artillery tactics and strategy, and after returning to China, he joined Yuan Shikai's Beiyang Army. In 1906 he was transferred to Fengtian Province, during which he secretly joined the Tongmenghui. In the 1911 revolution, he did not obey orders to suppress the rebellion, and instead pushed for a constitutional monarchy. After the revolution, he was appointed by Yuan Shikai as Governor of Suiyuan. In 1917, he participated in the activities of Duan Qirui against Zhang Xun. In 1920, he joined the Zhili Clique because he was a relative with Wu Peifu and Feng Yuxiang, and his close personal friendship with Cao Kun. He served in a variety of ministerial positions throughout the late 1920s and early 1930s, and narrowly dodged an assassination attempt in 1928 ordered by Zhang Zuolin.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nHe is good at acupuncture and likes to practice martial arts.\nHe is well-known as an eccentric and strange figure. Frequently, he has been heard to mutter 'I am a reincarnation of a Buddha. Most people are the reincarnation of my subordinates. But there are also some demons in this world, I hope that the gods can give me an axe, which I will use to destroy the demons.'"
QIE_DU_XIJUN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1882\nHejian, Zhili, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nDu was one of many Chinese students sent abroad to study Japanese military tactics as part of the Qing Dynasty's attempted modernizing reforms prior to the revolution. Du's exact role in the events of 1911 have been heavily disputed, with some claiming he was initially loyal to the Qing, and other accusing him of being a key figure in organizing the Wuchang Uprising. The story as told by Du himself and his Zhili allies has been heavily revised to put him on the right side of history. From 1926 and forward he served as Wu Peifu's handpicked governor of Hubei province, initially struggling to oppose the Kuomintang's invasion of Zhili controlled territory during the Northern Expedition. After the Zhili Clique managed to turn the tide of the war, Du assumed full control of Hubei, managing to stabilizing the war torn province into a loyal stronghold of Zhili influence. His ties to Japan kept him from being promoted too highly within the Zhili command structure, but following the reforms enacted by Wu in the wake of the LEP collapse he has been promoted to the high command."
QIE_WANG_LINGYUN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nSeptember 27th, 1899\nLuoyang, Henan, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nWang Lingyun joined Wu Peifu’s engineer battalion in 1920, however not long after that he enrolled in the Yiyang academy. After his graduation in 1924, he joined the Zhensong Army led by Liu Zhenhua. During the Northern Expedition, the Zhensong Army aligned with Zhili Clique and fought against NRA, subsequently participating in the Fourth Zhili-Fengtian War. For his outstanding performance Wang was integrated into Zhili Clique and entered Wu Peifu's personal circle, serving as an advisor for engineering and fortification matters. Following the reforms enacted by Wu and other senior Zhili generals, he was promoted to Brigadier General, the youngest ever in the Imperial Army. Skilled in fortification and defensive tactics, he has supported Jiang Baili's Plan to defend China from Japansese invasion."
QIE_GUO_JIJIAO_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nOctober 15th, 1902\nHefei, Anhui, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nAfter Guo Jiyu’s primary school graduation, he was admitted to the county’s middle school, but he eventually had to stop because of his brother’s high school fees and instead transferred to the Beijing Military Academy. In 1917, Guo Jiyu entered the Qinghe Army's First Preparatory Officer School. Two years later, he was assigned to the First Division of the Frontier Defence Artillery Corps and the Northwest Frontier Defence Second Mixed Brigade. In 1921, Guo transferred to the Baoding Army Military Academy, and graduated with full honours in 1923. There, he became involved with the Zhili clique, though his young aged prevented rapid promotion. He became allies with Liu Menggeng during this period as well, and with Liu being chosen to spearhead his national defence plan, Guo was promoted to full General status.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nA secretary once told a visiting author an anecdote about Guo's hectic work ethic: '... (At his table) there are four or five telephones as well as telegrams and official documents. Guo went to work every morning at 8:00 A.M., retired in the afternoon to go home to eat two meals, then returned, and worked furiously until 11:00 in the evening, holding a telephone in one hand to listen to battlefield reports, while holding a pen in other. Documents he approved are thrown onto the ground, where a junior officer respectfully picks them up and sends them off.'"
QIE_WEI_YISAN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nFebruary 25th, 1884\nGaocheng, Zhili, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nWei Yishann attended the Baoding Army Military Academy School, and in 1920, he served as the head of the 4th Mixed Military Brigade of the Northwest Frontier Defence Force. In 1921, he joined the Fengtian Clique and served as the head of the 39th Regiment, switching over to teaching in 1923, when he served as the instructor of the Northeast Army, and later served as the chief of staff of the 27th Division of the Northeast Army, as well as a variety of other commands throughout the early 1920s. In May 1926, however, he deserted the Fengtian and joined Wu Peifu’s Zhili Clique. A capable officer, Wei ingratiated himself with Liu Menggeng in the early 1930s, and when his defence plan was selected for China Wei was promoted to full General rank."
QIE_STILLWELL_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nMarch 19th, 1883\nPalatka, Florida, USA\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nFollowing the defeat of democratic forces in the Second American Civil War, Joseph Stillwell, former Federalist commander, has fled to China with a few of his former soldiers. During the 1920s and early 30s he served as military attaché to the Qing Empire, and during the time him and Wu grew close friends. Following the Fall of Washington and the widespread exile of many former Federalists, Stillwell and his men initially escaped to Canada. Disliking the internecine bickering in the Republic in Exile, Stillwell utilized his connections in China to secure a position with the Beijing government. Him and his men sailed soon after, arriving in China to help train the disorganized Chinese forces with their years of experience in the ruins of the United States.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nBecame an expert in urban warfare during the Siege of New York."

Merrill spent most of the war fighting in the swamps of Florida, leading his band of Federal troops on an insurgent campaign against Longist forces in the opening days of the war. Renowned for his ability to fight in environments most men would never dare set foot in, Merrill has already proven himself a valuable ally of the Zhili regime."
QIE_DU_XIGUI_NAVY_DESC:0 "§YAdmiral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nNovember 12th, 1874\nFuzhou, Fujian, Qing Empire\n§YNaval Career:§L\nBorn into a poor family, Du followed his brothers footsteps and joined the navy to escape his family's impoverished situation. He graduated from the Nanjing Jiangnan Naval Academy in 1902, before going on to further education in the United Kingdom. This was followed by a career in the modernizing Qing navy, where Du served on and captained some of the largest ships under Chinese control. During the Wuchang uprising, he deserted the Qing Empire, and aligned himself with the Zhili Clique. During the Zhili-dominated government of 1923/1924 he served as Minister of the Navy. During the KMT’s Northern Expedition a large number of his sailors nearly convinced him to desert, but the presence of German warships kept him in line, and he supported the German Navy in their coastal bombardment missions. Restored to his position of Minister of the Navy, Du has little time left for active ship command.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nHad an extensive opium and drinking habit in his youth. Though he largely recovered, the upheaval of the 1920s has pushed him back into heavy drinking."
QIE_WU_RENLI_NAVY_DESC:0 "§YAdmiral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1874\nHefei, Anhui, Qing Empire\n§YNaval Career:§L\nDetails on Wu’s early life are scarce, but In 1890, he entered the Weihai Marine Academy, though it appears he transferred to the Tianjin Beiyang Naval Academy and graduated with honours in 1896. He held a variety of teaching positions at the Baoding military academy throughout the 1910s, including as a teacher of both French and English. Here, he became acquainted with many future Zhili Clique generals. Quickly promoted through the ranks, Wu stayed largely isolated from many of the political turmoils that ensnared fellow naval officers, and has a reputation of being somewhat ‘apolitical’ - or the closest to apolitical one can get in this period in Chinese history. A competent officer, Wu has served with distinction throughout the 1920s and 1930s."
QIE_SA_ZHENBING_NAVY_DESC:0 "§YAdmiral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nMarch 30th, 1859\nHefei, Anhui, Qing Empire\n§YNaval Career:§L\nBorn into a family of Qarluk descent, Sa attended the Fuzhou Naval Academy, graduating 1872. After this, he attended the Royal Naval College in the United Kingdom, where he came face to face with modern naval innovations. Returning home, he participated in the Sino-Japanese war, where as the youngest commander in the Qing Navy he was forced to surrender to the Japanese after the Battle of Weihawei after all his commanding officers committed suicide. Leading the naval reforms after the peace treaty was signed, Sa was largely oblivious to the larger political maelstrom brewing in China. During the Wuchang uprising he faced a full-scale mutiny, and retired to Shanghai rather than either fire on his own men, or betray his country. He briefly served as Acting Premier in 1920, before taking the largely ceremonial position of the Governor of Fujian in 1922, where he essentially planned to retire. Here, he became acquainted with the Zhili clique and began to advise Wu and other, junior members of the Navy on modernizing the ageing fleet. Following the Manchu Restoration in 1927, Sa formally re-joined naval high command to help spearhead the adoption of new German tactics and ships."
QIE_ZAIXUN_NAVY_DESC:0 "§YAdmiral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nMay 20th, 1885\nBeijing, Qing Empire\n§YNaval Career:§L\nZaixun was adopted into the lineage of his relative, Yizhi (1827–1850), because Yizhi had no son to succeed him. In 1887, he was made a buru bafen fuguo gong, and was subsequently promoted to feng'en fuguo gong in 1889 and feng'en zhenguo gong in 1890. In 1900, Zaixun's predecessor, Zaiyi, who succeeded Yizhi as 'Prince Rui of the Second Rank' (later renamed to 'Prince Duan of the Second Rank'), was stripped off his title of nobility and exiled to Xinjiang for his role in the Boxer Rebellion. Two years later, Zaixun succeeded Zaiyi as a beile of the Prince Rui peerage. In 1908, he was made an acting junwang (Prince of the Second Rank) but remained nominally a beile. In 1909, Zaixun was appointed as an acting Navy Minister in the Imperial Cabinet headed by Prince Qing. Later, he was sent to Europe and the United States to study the navies of the Western powers. After returning to China, in 1911, he became a full Navy Minister. Following Puyi's autocoup, he has come out of retirement to serve again as Navy minister. Despite never holding a battle command in his life he has been granted an admiralship. It is yet to be seen if he can competently command a warship in battle."

QIE_LING_BIN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nMarch 17th, 1910\nBeijing, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn into an upper-middle class merchant family, Ling grew up in the most cutting-edge academic circles in Beijing, with his parents being members of the Chinese Empire Reform Association, the predecessor of the NCERA. Only 17 during Puyi's restoration, the corruption and scandal that plagued the new empire greatly dismayed the impressionable young man, and on the suggestion of a friend he attended clandestine meetings of the Young China Party. From those meetings he attended the Baoding military academy, where he quickly stood out as both politically and militarily shrewd. Along with Fang Zhejian he assembled a group of young cadets dedicated to reforming the Empire. Interestingly, Ling was not a rabid anti-monarchist, and quickly appreciated how Wu Peifu and the Zhili had manipulated Puyi to serve as a legitimizing symbol of the regime."
QIE_FANG_ZHIJIAN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nAugust 1st, 1909\nHuanggang, Hubei, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nHailing from a poor peasant family, Fang's teachers in the village school noticed the young boy excelled in all of his lessons. Cobbling together a small sum of money, they sent the young boy to the local provincial secondary school. Unfortunately for Fang, warlord soldiers arrived in the provincial capital and burned the school, nearly killing Fang. The young man was left with a scar running down his leg and a burning hatred for warlords and the chaos they inflicted on the poor of China. After taking the entrance exams to Baoding Military Academy, he joined the Young China Party branch at the campus, though his sympathies lay more with the NCERA. He led one of the squads that arrested and executed senior Zhili leadership during the coup, and the command experience he picked up there made him stand out so much to Li Bingzhi that he promoted the young man on the spot."

QIE_rebuild_domestic_ind:0 "민간 산업 재건"
QIE_rebuild_domestic_ind_desc:0 "The riots and violence that engulfed Beijing destroyed large parts of the city, including some industry. We should clear the rubble and build larger, more advanced factories on top of the ruins."

QIE_yan_xishan:0 "옌시산"
QIE_yan_xishan_desc:0 "Governor Yan Xishan was an unexpected ally in our coup. Previously an anti-monarchist, his shrewd political mind realized that the Emperor is now a powerful political tool.

QIE_modernize_monarchy_desc:0 "While Song is a Qing loyalist, he also realizes the position of the Emperor needs to change to suit modern notions of government.

QIE_train_civil_servants:0 "열차 공무원"
QIE_train_civil_servants_desc:0 "The Zhili bureaucracy relied on nepotism, cronyism and endemic, widespread corruption.

QIE_prepare_coast:0 "해안 대비"
QIE_prepare_coast_desc:0 "The Shandong province suffered greatly under the warlord rule of Zhang Zhongchang, and currently stands vulnerable to foreign invasion.

QIE_end_shanxi_isolation_desc:0 "The Shanxi province, though rich in mineral wealth, is mountainous and isolated. If it is ever to be re-integrated into the larger national government, we need to invest in roads, rail lines, and other infrastructure projects to connect it with the rest of China."

QIE_pick_YCP:0 "중국 청년당을 선택"
QIE_pick_YCP_desc:0 "The Young China Party, or YCP, is made up of young Baoding Academy cadets, with some urban intellectuals providing the funding and organization. Focused on centralizing the country and urbanization, they lack the broad popular appeal of the NCERA - though their modernizing focus makes them a good choice for quick development."
QIE_pick_MP:0 "만주당을 선택"
QIE_pick_MP_desc:0 "The Manchu Party is, obviously, dominated by the Manchu nobility in Beijing. While this may appear an odd choice for a ruling party, over the last ten years the nobles used the relative freedom afforded to them by the Zhili to build up large industrial fortunes, investing in the few factories opened in Beijing not owned by German firms, giving them significant clout."
QIE_rural_reform:0 "농촌개혁운동 제도화"
QIE_rural_reform_desc:0 "The chaos and destruction of the Warlord Era left large swaths of rural China devastated and destroyed. The Rural Reconstruction Movement, half of the NCERA, has attempted to fix these problems independent of government support for the last few years. With proper funding, however, they can make a real difference in rebuilding China. "
QIE_ncera_industry:0 "농촌산업투자"
QIE_ncera_industry_desc:0 "While the little industry China has is currently concentrated in its cities, they are vulnerable to military attack and unrest.

QIE_kang_youwei:0 "캉유웨이의 유산"
QIE_kang_youwei_desc:0 "Kang Youwei was one of the founders of the NCERA, though he passed away soon after its inception in 1927. A brilliant scholar and legal reformer, Kang spent half a century arguing for a constitutional monarchy with an Emperor who truly looked out for his people.

QIE_rural_infastructure:0 "농촌기반시설 현대화"

QIE_benevolent_emperor:0 "자비로운 황제"
QIE_benevolent_emperor_desc:0 "While most in the West think the Emperor of China is some sort of despotic warlord straight out of the Middle Ages, we know that the Emperor is a benevolent and kind soul who wants the best for his subjects.

QIE_reform_criminal_justice:0 "형사 사법제도 개혁"
QIE_reform_criminal_justice_desc:0 "Like many other areas of their government, the Zhili Clique blatantly ignored what little civil laws they bothered to right, preferring to rule via the might of their arms.

QIE_military_state:0 "지역 무장화"
QIE_military_state_desc:0 "The Zhili Clique, while a military organization, left large parts of the Qing military completely inefficient and underfunded. In order to rectify this problem, we have begun a whole-sale militarization of the nation.

QIE_centralize_state:0 "국가 중앙집권화"
QIE_centralize_state_desc:0 "The last two decades of internecine warlord conflict left China divided and decentralized.

QIE_YCP_arsenals:0 "조병창 현대화"
QIE_YCP_arsenals_desc:0 "The arsenals that are to supply are war machine are sorely out of date and underfunded. Concerted investment must be made into weapons and ammunition production if we are to stand any chance of victory over our foes."
QIE_destroy_leftists:0 "좌파 척결"
QIE_destroy_leftists_desc:0 "While there are few actual leftists within the territory we directly control, the recent KMT uprising to the south has sparked something of a 'Red Scare' within the elite.

QIE_emperor_unifier:0 "황제 폐하를 위하여"
QIE_emperor_unifier_desc:0 "While some may see the Emperor as anachronistic to our modernizing, centralizing vision, he can serve as a useful tool -  a rallying point around which the formally disparate, decentralized country can unify.

QIE_YCP_modernization:0 "민간산업 현대화"
QIE_YCP_modernization_desc:0 "The few civilian industries not formerly run by the Germans are laughable by Western standards. With the German industrial withdrawal, we can take their designs and apply them to our own factories, modernizing them and significantly increasing our industrial output."

QIE_appoint_viceroys:0 "새로운 총독 임명"
QIE_appoint_viceroys_desc:0 "The provincial governors employed by the Zhili clique were corrupt, inefficient, and, worst of all, disloyal to the Emperor.

QIE_new_coronation:0 "새로운 대관식?"
QIE_new_coronation_desc:0 "A controversial idea has floated around the Manchu nobility ever since the anti-Zhili coup - a second coronation for Puyi.

QIE_imperial_arsenals_desc:0 "Much wealth is concentrated in the hands of Manchu nobility. By appealing to their sense of patriotism and loyalty to the Emperor, we can convince them to invest these funds in the construction of new arsenals."

QIE_noble_factories_desc:0 "With the expulsion all German industrialists in the wake of the coup, many factories they formally ran now lie vacant.

QIE_raise_banners:0 "팔기군 부활"
QIE_raise_banners_desc:0 "While the Banner System was mainly dissolved in the wake of the Taiping Rebellion, some Qing generals are now suggesting we create a modern version of the system.

QIE_imperial_roads_desc:0 "The road network left by the Zhili bureaucracy is inefficient and poorly maintained. Through contracts with various local dignitaries and the wealth of the imperial treasury, we can set out building a road network worthy of the imperial name!"
QIE_mandate_heaven:0 "천명"
QIE_mandate_heaven_desc:0 "Some might claim it an outdated term, but what is the Mandate of Heaven but not a popular expression of the legitimate will of the government?

QIE_manchu_default_debt:0 "채무불이행 선언"
QIE_manchu_default_debt_desc:0 "While we have created a new government, international creditors do not see things the same way.

QIE_imperial_consolidation:0 "중원에 질서를"
QIE_imperial_consolidation_desc:0 "The majority of China is ruled by warlord cliques, leftists, and even worse - republicans. These traitors must be destroyed! Soon, our armies will march out to destroy these rats and unify China behind the banner of the Emperor!"

QIE_destroy_concessions_desc:0 "The Legation Cities are a stain on China's sovereignty and independence.

QIE_destroy_germany_desc:0 "독일에게 산둥성을 양보한 이후, 우리는 더러운 튜턴족들이 우리 땅을 오염시키는 꼴을 너무 오랫동안 지켜봐왔습니다! 그들은 유럽에서의 전쟁에 여념이 없으므로, 당장 이 제국주의자들의 전초기지를 되찾아야만 합니다."
QIE_false_republic:0 "북부 반역자 처리"
QIE_false_republic_desc:0 "The fools to the north claim to be the 'last bastion' of China's legitimate government. In reality they are little more than Japanese lapdogs. While they slavishly serve their masters we should strike and reclaim our homeland!"

QIE_rebuild_command_structure:0 "지휘구조 재구성"
QIE_rebuild_command_structure_desc:0 "The civil war against the Zhili remnants left our high command in tatters.

QIE_foreigner_against_foreigner:0 "외세에 반대하는 외국인"
QIE_foreigner_against_foreigner_desc:0 "While the German scum polluted our nation with their delusional ideas of racial 'superiority', few denied their military prowess. We should seek out non-aligned foreign agents to help train our military, even if this slightly contradicts our new anti-concession stance. A prepared military is worth a few angry intellectuals. "
QIE_look_to_our_past:0 "과거로부터의 교훈"
QIE_look_to_our_past_desc:0 "Instead of turning to the foreigners, let us instead look to the past for inspiration on how to reform our military. The tried and true methods of the Warlord Era are still effective, and will allow us to destroy our enemies."
QIE_assess_doctrines:0 "교리 평가"
QIE_assess_doctrines_desc:0 "The rapidly changing face of modern warfare has necessitated us to take a long hard look at our military doctrine. Should we continue to use plans drawn up by the Zhili, or attempt to devise plans of our own?"
QIE_uneasy_coalition:0 "불안한 연합"
QIE_uneasy_coalition_desc:0 "Each of the political groups that helped overthrow the Zhili clique have much to offer the military.

While we must all work together to defeat the Japanese, each group may want concessions if they are not in power."
QIE_rural_defense_force:0 "향촌방위군 창설"
QIE_rural_defense_force_desc:0 "For too long the peasantry of China have been terrorized by roving warbands of looters and bandits.

QIE_manchu_air_warfare_desc:0 "While we would like take as little as possible from the foreign devils, there is little debate that their mastery over aerial warfare is undisputed. We should study their doctrine and tactics, so that we may apply them to our own air force."

QIE_social_democrat_party_long:0 "신보황회                                    §gThe NCERA, while using the name of a pre-Xinhai reformist group, is actually an alliance of two, more modern, reform groups. The first is the Rural Reconstruction Party (RRP), lead by Liang Shuming and the Harvard and Princeton educated J.C. 'Jimmy' Yen. Favoring rebuilding China from the ground-up, this group emphasizes the value of the traditional Chinese village as the basic building block of society, rather than the warlords cliques that have dominated China for the last half-century. The second part of the coalition is a loose group of intellectuals inspired to the works of Kang Youwei, an ambitious reformer of the late Qing dynasty who advocated for a constitutional monarchy. Following the restoration of Puyi, his works have come back into prominence, and are popular among middle-class urban intellectuals. The NCERA want to see an end to warlords and foreign influence in China, and a return to a ‘traditional’ style of  decentralized local rule. "
QIE_social_liberal_party:0 "중국 청년당"
QIE_social_liberal_party_long:0 "중국 청년당      §gInspired by the Young Turks, the YCP is comprised of officers at Baoding Military Academy and urban intellectuals alienated by the exclusivity and nepotism of the Zhili clique. They advocate for the elimination of China's warlords and the establishment of a strong central government, as well as a nationalist agenda which focuses on the abolition of the special privileges and extraterritoriality enjoyed by foreign powers in China. They also wish to see the end of warlords and factionalism, and stress a return to a ‘legitimate’ government in China. While not necessarily in favor of Puyi and the Aisin Gioro clan, they also realize they are the best chance at achieving their dream."
QIE_market_liberal_party:0 "번영연맹"
QIE_market_liberal_party_long:0 "번영연맹                    §gThe PL is mainly the party of the new industrialist and banker class, who are suspicious of the HA’s corruption and inefficiency. Germany, also wary of Wu’s ambition but not wanting to revoke its support for the only bulwark of an unpopular regime, has focused on turning informal social clubs frequented by the new industrial upper class into an organized political party, facilitating connections between elites across the country through AoG organized 'progress expositions' that pushed a free-trade agenda as well as modern farming techniques and the newest technology.  While not overtly hostile to Wu’s ambitions, the PL mainly acts as a lobbying group, pushing for increased free trade, relaxed government regulations, and industrial stimulus - nominally for the interests of the elite - but truly for the Peking-Kommission. This is also the party favored by German-trained officers in the fledgling Qing navy, whose inter-service rivalry with the Zhili-dominated military has been deliberately stoked by Germany."

QIE_social_conservative_party_long:0 "종사당 (만주당)                              §gThe Zongshe party - more commonly known as the ‘Manchu Party’ - is a group of Manchu nobles, Qing loyalists, and various Aisin Gioro princes. Opposed to Wu’s Zhili clique, they favor a return to Qing control over all of China. Unlike more radical factions, they are willing to tolerate warlords and some degree of factionalism - as long as they swear complete and utter loyalty to the Emperor. If in power, they would also allow elections, but in a German-style system where the Emperor would have ultimate say."

QIE_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "화합회                     §gThe Harmony Association is a loose collection of Zhili bureaucrats, governors and hangers-on that represent Wu Peifu and Cao Kun's attempts to present a facade of democratic legitimacy in the Beijing Assembly. Officially they are a separate political party, completely divested from the military. Unofficially, however, most realize that the HA's sham democracy is little more than a half-hearted attempt to cover up the endemic corruption, innefficency, and waste of the Zhili bureaucracy."

qiedom.1.t:0 "대청국"
qiedom.1.d:0 "1928년, 국제적 중재에 의해 직봉전쟁이 막을 내렸습니다. 전쟁이 초래한 4년간의 혼란과 불안정은 1911년 신해혁명 이후로 유지되었던 평화의 종식을 의미했습니다. 우페이푸와 그의 직예군벌은 만주족 황실의 복고를 수용했지만, 독일에 대한 이권 제공은 거부했으며, 독일과의 관계는 급속히 냉각되었습니다. 그럼에도 독일은 청 정부에 대한 지원을 계속 유지하고 있습니다. 이는 독일의 대중국 전략인 '분할 및 정복'의 일환으로써 난징 계열 군벌들의 팽창을 억제하는 한편, 점진적으로 중국 내에 보루를 구축해 일본을 견제할 수 있으리라는 기대감에 기인한 것입니다.\n\n일본의 마수가 화베이와 화둥을 가로지르고 있습니다. 청은 동북부의 반항적인 봉천 정부에서부터 중국의 나머지 지역에 걸친 다양한 표면상의 우방에 이르기까지 중원 전역에 자국의 권위를 관철시켜 마땅하다고 여기지만, 정작 제국의 구성원들은 지리적 요소와 지역주의 정서를 기반으로 각각 독립해 있습니다. 그 결과 청은 사실상 화베이 평원에 국한된 채로, 또한 흔들리고 있는 국가 질서의 선두에 선 채로 1936년에 들어섰습니다."
qiedom.1.a:0 "황제 폐하 만세!"

qiedom.2.t:0 "정치적 현황"
qiedom.2.d:0 "1936년, 무력한 의회는 벼랑 끝에 서 있습니다. 5개 파벌이 의회를 구성하고 있고, 모두가 거의 권력이 없어 보입니다. 하지만, 그들을 배후에서 지원하는 세력들은 무시할 수 있을만큼 사소하진 않습니다. 이들중 가장 강력한 파벌은 차오쿤 의장이 명목상으로 이끌고 있는 화합회입니다. 화합회를 실질적으로 주도하는 사람은 우울증에 시달리는 알코올 중독자 차오쿤이 아닌 우페이푸로, 화합회는 그가 의회에서 직예군벌의 발언권을 보장하기 위해 설립한 파벌입니다. 명목상 독립 정당이지만, 모두가 전 직예 장군들인 화합회 의원들, 합법적인 선거를 통해 재선된 것이 아닌것이 확실해보이는 차오쿤 의장 등의 여러 증거들이 화합회가 우페이푸의 국가 통치 수단에 불과하다는것을 보여주고 있습니다.\n\n번영연맹 역시 비슷한 파벌로, 스스로가 정당이라고 주장하지만 대부분의 사람들은 그들이 베이징에 대한 독일의 이해관계를 대변해주는 로비 단체에 불과하다고 여기고 있는 상황입니다.\n\n이 둘에 이어, 이들에 반대 입장을 보이고 있는 3개 정당이 있습니다. 청나라 황족들과 전직 황실 관료들로 구성된 만주당, 중국의 청년 튀르크당이 되려고 하는 바오딩 군관학교 출신들의 중국 청년당, 그리고 친황제파이자 동시에 중국 촌락들의 전통적 이상에 따른 개편과 군벌 타도를 부르짖고 있는 신보황회입니다. 이 세 파벌은 우페이푸에 반대하고 있지만, 우페이푸는 그의 인기 없는 정권을 정당화하기 위한 하나의 수단으로 그들이 유명무실한 의회에서 자리를 차지하는 것을 허락해 주었습니다."
qiedom.2.a:0 "흥미로운걸."

qiedom.3.t:0 "부채 구조조정"
qiedom.3.d:0 "지난 몇 년동안 우페이푸와 차오쿤은 정치적 자본의 대부분을 청의 막대한 부채를 줄이고 재조정하는데 사용해 왔습니다. 하지만 이는 이론적으론 가능해 보였지만, 지방 성장들의 비협조같은 여러 난관에 부딪쳤습니다. 남부의 불안정한 상황에 관한 소문들이 계획을 더욱 어렵게 만들고 있는 가운데, 차오쿤은 이번달 말 설날 행사 이후에 의회에서 국가 채무를 줄이는 데에 대한 연설을 할 계획입니다."
qiedom.3.a:0 "연설을 기다려 보자..."

qiedom.4.t:0 "왕첸빈의 죽음"
qiedom.4.d:0 "Earlier this morning Wang Chengbin, a senior member of the Zhili clique and major ally of Cao Kun, passed away due to old age. While his death in and of itself is a blow to our command structure, it reveals a worrying trend. Many senior Zhili military officials are of old age, poor health, or both, and the corruption endemic in our military prevents younger officers from advancing through the ranks. Unless a serious effort is made, our high command will soon consist solely of doddering, senile old men terrified of adapting new technologies and doctrines."
qiedom.4.a:0 "What about age bringing wisdom?"

qiedom.5.t:0 "Ripples of Black Monday"
qiedom.5.d:0 "While in the weeks following Black Monday it appeared that we had escaped the worst of the damage, over the last few days German affiliated businesses have been hit with supply chain issues and increased prices. While the economic disruption is nowhere near the scale experienced in Europe and the Americas, this is still a blow to our economy."
qiedom.5.a:0 "Damn it!"

qiedom.13.t:0 "Election Results - Victory!"
qiedom.13.d:0 "Results are in from the parts of China still stable enough to hold elections. Turnout was (as expected) quite low, but in cities like Beijing we received record numbers of votes from intellectuals, reformers, and others previously opposed to our rule.

In this vacuum of silence from Anqing's leaders comes more disturbing impressions. Governor Chen Yi, infamous for his association with the Black Dragons, has been spotted in Anqing by more refugees.

Already, he fears military matters are falling to the wayside due to his duties as 'National Protector', and has ordered that the scholars drafting the constitution come up with a list of potential new presidents for the Republic. Two candidates have emerged: Scholar and intellectual Hu Shih, and diplomat and (briefly) former president V. K. Wellington Ku (Gu Weijun).\n\nHu is well-known for his theory of 'pragmatism' (shíyànzhuyì), a concept first originating in the United States in the 1870s and 80s. In Hu's writings, he advocates for cooperation with warlords and working to change the Chinese government from the inside-out, instead of ripping it down and rebuilding it like many in the KMT. Following the failure of the Northern Expedition this theory has gained many adherents, and is quite popular in academic circles.\n\nWellington Koo, on the other hand, is a diplomatic genius and politician, who attended the Versailles conference in 1920 as an observer, and helped negotiate several deals with American, German, and British diplomats, giving him a dearth of diplomatic experience that will no doubt be useful in legitimizing our government."
qiefocus.8.a:0 "Wu selects Hu Shih"
qiefocus.8.b:0 "Wu selects Wellington Koo"

qiefocus.9.t:0 "Inaugurating the New Republic"
qiefocus.9.d:0 "In an elaborate ceremony today, Wu Peifu oversaw the swearing in of the new President of the Republic to adoring cheers. The assembly remains firmly in control of the Harmony Association, and many still question the legitimacy of this new regime. Still, Wu no longer has to contend with the Manchu as a potential opponent, and can instead concentrate on fixing the massive debt issues facing China, and starting to re-unify the fractured country.\n\nAdditionally, despite our best efforts to present our government as the legitimate government of China, few see us that way. We will need to either destroy or coerce the groups that oppose our regime, and convince the general population we are the true government of China!"
qiefocus.9.a:0 "Congratulations, Mr. President!"

qiefocus.10.t:0 "Debt and Legitimacy"
qiefocus.10.d:0 "The debt issue continues to interfere with our economic efforts, and impedes our attempts to reinforce the legitimacy of our new government. While we could ask Germany for support, it is likely that this will cause our already unpopular government to collapse under public pressure. The much more shrewd plan is to take an anti-concession stance, defaulting on our debt but earning us the loyalty of our population."
qiefocus.10.a:0 "Default. It's the only choice."

qiefocus.11.t:0 "The Future of the Zhili Clique"
qiefocus.11.d:0 "The Zhili clique, like every other warlord clique in China, operates primarily on a basis of seniority and on mentor-mentee relationships. This, while (usually) providing stability and helping reduce the probability for back-stabbing, also stifles meritocracy and promotions based on skill. With the recent deaths and advancing age of many senior generals, however, we may be forced to take drastic action, and promote younger officers to the forefront of our military.\n\nFour candidates have emerged for elevation to the full general corps: Guo Jijioa, Wang Lingyun, Du Xijun and Wei Yisan."
qiefocus.11.a:0 "Promote these promising young men! Now to start our defence plan."

qiefocus.12.t:0 "A Defence Plan for China"
qiefocus.12.d:0 "Following Wu Peifu’s call for a meeting of senior Zhili generals, a large number have arrived in Luoyang, leaving their subordinates in charge of front-line duties. The first pressing concern is picking a centralized defence strategy for the inevitable war with Japan and the Fengtian government. The northern traitor’s growing boldness in the wake of the League collapse has alarmed many senior commanders, including Jiang Baili and Liu Menggeng. The two men have spent the last few weeks codifying plans they have been developing over the last two years and have presented them to the assembled Zhili commanders. Jiang’s focuses on large-scale defensive fortifications, moving industry to the interior of China, and rousing the ‘fighting spirit’ of China in order to defeat Japan.\n\nWhile not a direct opposite to Jiang’s plan, Liu’s plan focuses more on improving the fighting capability of Zhili troops. Improved morale, drill standards, and logistical support are key, at least in his eyes, of ensuring Chinese victory. Updated medical care also plays a crucial part of the strategy. Both are compelling plans, but it is up to Wu Peifu to ultimately decide."
qiefocus.12.a:0 "Pick Jiang Baili's plan"
qiefocus.12.b:0 "Pick Liu Menggeng's plan"

qiefocus.13.t:0 "Financial Proposal"
qiefocus.13.d:0 "Filler idk what ended up happening with this" 
qiefocus.13.a:0 "Meet the bankers."

qiefocus.14.t:0 "Rebuilding our Command Structure"
qiefocus.14.d:0 "Following the purge of many senior members of the Zhili Clique, our army has been left without much of a command structure. It has fallen on Li Bingzhi, one of the few Zhili deserters, and two Aisin-Gioro princes, Zaitao and the Emperor’s brother Pujie, to reform the Imperial command structure. This will not be an easy task, as Wu and his cronies essentially did away with a modern divisional structure based on meritorious promotion in favour of cronyism and nepotism. While their reforms will take time to implement, they have decided to fill out the thin roster of senior commanders with Fang Zhijian and Liang Bin, two young Baoding cadets who helped overthrow the Zhili. Though inexperienced, with any luck they will learn quickly."
qiefocus.14.a:0 "Excellent"

qiefocus.15.t:0 "Assessing Doctrine"
qiefocus.15.d:0 "The next major issue facing the military rebuilders is the issue of doctrine. The Zhili were hesitant to innovate, instead relying on old, but well-tried and tested doctrine. As China modernizes, however, we may be forced to fundamentally shift our doctrine. Which direction should we take our forces in?"
qiefocus.15.a:0 "Artillery decided many of the battles of the Warlord Era."
qiefocus.15.b:0 "We have many devoted subjects ready to throw down their lives for the Emperor..."
qiefocus.15.c:0 "Grand battleplans are the way to winning the coming war."

qiefocus.16.t:0 "The Uneasy Coalition"
qiefocus.16.d:0 "While all of the reformist parties were formally united in their desire to overthrow the Zhili, now that the dust has settled following the coup they find themselves in an uneasy position. Japan and the Fengtian loom large, and they must work together in order to avoid annihilation. Yet at the same time the different reform groups have differing goals and objectives, and varying things they can contribute to the military. Puyi and his advisors need the support of each of the parties and their military wings to win the eventual war with Japan, but doing so will come at a cost..."
qiefocus.16.a:0 "At least this is better than the Zhili."

qiefocus.17.t:0 "The Yellow Sand Society"
qiefocus.17.d:0 "Beyond the Rural Defence Forces employed by the NCERA, the Yellow Sands Society, an esoteric sect with connections to the Yiguandao, have offered to join our army. They are fierce fighters, and relatively loyal given our new anti-concession stance, but some fear accepting their offer to join our army will allow the Yiguandao another opportunity to infiltrate as well."
qiefocus.17.a:0 "Offer them a place in the army."
qiefocus.17.b:0 "No, this is too risky."

qiefocus.18.t:0 "The Emergency Government"
qiefocus.18.d.zhang:0 "Now that their rule over Beijing is secure, Aisin-Gioro Puyi and his advisors have begun assembling an emergency government to rule China until the country is stable enough for elections to be held. Of the three groups that helped overthrow the Zhili, each have an ambitious reform agenda, and dedicated support from specific groups of the population. Complicating matters, however, is the fact that Zhang Tianran is pushing for the NCERA to be picked, owing to their rural reform agenda. We can overrule his suggestion, but it will cost us political power."
qiefocus.18.d.song:0 "Now that their rule over Beijing is secure, Aisin-Gioro Puyi and his advisors have begun assembling an emergency government to rule China until the country is stable enough for elections to be held. Of the three groups that helped overthrow the Zhili, each have an ambitious reform agenda, and dedicated support from specific groups of the population. Complicating matters, however, is the fact that Song Zheyuan is pushing for the Zhongshe Party to be picked, owing to their traditionalist agenda. We can overrule his suggestion, but it will cost us political power."
qiefocus.18.d.yan:0 "Now that their rule over Beijing is secure, Aisin-Gioro Puyi and his advisors have begun assembling an emergency government to rule China until the country is stable enough for elections to be held. Of the three groups that helped overthrow the Zhili, each have an ambitious reform agenda, and dedicated support from specific groups of the population. Complicating matters, however, is the fact that Yan Xishan is pushing for the YCP to be picked, owing to their push for aggressive modernization. We can overrule his suggestion, but it will cost us political power."
qiefocus.18.a:0 "Pick the Manchu (Zhongshe) Party."
qiefocus.18.b:0 "Pick the YCP."
qiefocus.18.c:0 "Pick the NCERA."

qiefocus.22.t:0 "A New Coronation?"
qiefocus.22.d:0 "An unusual idea has been circulating among Manchu nobles over the last few weeks - organizing a second coronation for Puyi. They claim that since the Restoration of 1927 was carried out under the supervision of the Zhili clique it was not really ‘proper’ and that a new reinstating ceremony must be carried out in order to appease the traditions of the empire. The cost for this would be staggeringly high, but it may give us some legitimacy, and will earn us further support from the nobles."
qiefocus.22.a:0 "Organize the ceremony!"
qiefocus.22.b:0 "This is a waste of money..."

qiefocus.23.t:0 "The Dynasties Arrive"
qiefocus.23.d:0 "Over the last few days the Marquis of Extended Grace, Duke Minsheng, and other various descendants of old Imperial dynasties have arrived in Beijing. One by one they file past the Emperor, silently bowing to pay their respects. In a novel first, a court photographer has been tasked with capturing each of these submissions, and they will be distributed as propaganda to both prove the legitimacy of the Emperor, and erode any support for a non-Manchu ruling family."
qiefocus.23.a:0 "Excellent!"

qiefocus.24.t:0 "Our New Benefactor"
qiefocus.24.d:0 "Ever since the coup that toppled the Zhili Clique, the future of our government remained uncertain. Now, however, the warlord that helped overthrow Wu is set to depart for Beijing, where we expect much of their agenda to be revealed..."
qiefocus.24.a:0 "Welcome Governor Yan to Beijing!"
qiefocus.24.b:0 "Welcome Governor Song to Beijing!"
qiefocus.24.c:0 "Welcome Honoured Teacher Zhang to Beijing!"

qiefocus.25.t:0 "Our Future Relationship with Germany"
qiefocus.25.d:0 "Following our victory over Fengtian and the Japanese, senior Zhili diplomats are now considering the best course of action in regards to our continued relationship with [GER.GetName]. Some have advocated joining the Reichspakt, while others caution for a simple guarantee of independence. Still others say we should focus inward on developing our war-ravaged nation."
qiefocus.25.a:0 "Formally request to join the Reichspakt."
qiefocus.25.b:0 "Request a guarantee of independence."
qiefocus.25.c:0 "Focus on developing China instead."

qiefocus.26.t:0 "A Request from Beijing"
qiefocus.26.d:0 "The ambassador from the Qing Empire has formally requested to join the Reichspakt. This is an interesting opportunity - they could be a powerful ally in the East, having already bested the Fengtian Government and the Japanese Empire. At the same time though, they could drag us into wars far from home we care little about."
qiefocus.26.a:0 "Grant them entry."
qiefocus.26.b:0 "Refuse. They are a liability."

qiefocus.27.t:0 "A Request from Beijing"
qiefocus.27.d:0 "The ambassador from the Qing Empire has formally requested a guarantee of independence from us. This is an interesting opportunity - they were instrumental in defeating Japan, and this would not be binding for any of their aggressive wars."
qiefocus.27.a:0 "Sign the guarantee."
qiefocus.27.b:0 "Refuse. They are a liability."

qiefocus.28.t:0 "Reorganization of Warlord Divisions"
qiefocus.28.d:0 "Many Zhili warlords posses personal armies that they use to guard the provinces they govern. The fighting capabilities of these troops, however, are sub-par at best. They lack standardization and are more used to shaking down peasant farmers for cash than fighting pitched battles. Wu Peifu, as part of the overall plan to prepare the Zhili military for the inevitable conflict with Japan, has proposed reorganizing retraining these personal divisions along the national division standards. This plan has met with considerable opposition from Zhili generals, but we can overrule their concerns with significant political capital.\n\nIf we proceed with the reorganization, the new divisions should be ready in four months. If not, we can reorganize them at our own leisure, but it will be difficult to procure enough equipment."
qiefocus.28.a:0 "Begin the reorganization."
qiefocus.28.b:0 "We have better things to worry about."

qiefocus.29.t:0 "Reorganized Divisions Complete Training"
qiefocus.29.d:0 "The private militias, with considerable effort and training, have finished their reorganization, and are now equipped with the best supplies we have. This should significantly help us in our fight against Japan."
qiefocus.29.a:0 "Great!"

While we want to defend our former ally, our forces have been caught off-guard. We can intervene immediately, though overruling our top generals will cost significant political power.

qiefor.34.b:0 "Back down. We can't beat them yet..."

qiefor.35.t:0 "The [FNG.GetName] Attack!"
qiefor.35.d:0 "Our attempts to call Zhang Zuolin's bluff failed - he has begun mobilize his troops and formally declared war on us! We must ready our forces at once to destroy the Fengtian once and for all, and recreate our victory of 1927!"
qiefor.35.a:0 "Ready the troops!"

qiefor.36.t:0 "The [FNG.GetName] Back Down!"
qiefor.36.d:0 "Our plan to call [FNG.GetLeader]'s bluff has succeeded! We have heard nothing from his government after we sent our troops into the disputed areas and we can now safely assume that we have free reign to do whatever we want with the Shanxi province! Let's destroy the traitorous Governor Yan and integrate the area directly!"
qiefor.36.a:0 "Easy pickings!"
qiefor.36.b:0 "We have bigger things to worry about."

qiefor.37.t:0 "The [FNG.GetName] Back Down!"
qiefor.37.d:0 "The traitorous [FNG.GetLeader] has let us down! Despite our request for assistance he has ignored us in the face of the [QIE.GetName]!"
qiefor.37.a:0 "Damnation!"

qiefor.38.t:0 "The Manchu Demand we Submit!"
qiefor.38.d:0 "It appears our attempts at isolation and rebuilding are in vain. The new Manchu government in Beijing are demanding we officially recognize their authority and submit to their rule. Our recent work with the NCERA, an integral part of the new imperial coalition, probably has something to do with this. Resisting would not be a smart move, as they can easily overpower and destroy us."
qiefor.38.a:0 "We don't have much choice. Submit."
qiefor.38.b:0 "Refuse! Our independence is too valuable."

qiefor.39.t:0 "The Manchu Demand we Submit!"
qiefor.39.d:0 "The new Manchu regime in Beijing is demanding that we formally submit to their authority and recognize Puyi as Emperor of China! Even worse, they demand that we cede all 'temporal control' to the Emperor's Muslim cousin, Pugong. We can always refuse this request, though a war against the central government will be challenging to win..."
qiefor.39.a:0 "Submit, we don't have much choice."
qiefor.39.b:0 "We will destroy them!"

qiefor.40.t:0 "The Emperor Invites us to Swear Fealty"
qiefor.40.d:0 "While we did not help the Emperor orchestrate the coup that destroyed the Zhili clique, we were overwhelmingly supportive of this change of events. Now, the Emperor is formally inviting Governor Song to swear fealty to him and officially recognize him as Emperor of China!"
qiefor.40.a:0 "Pack our bags, we're heading to Beijing!"
qiefor.40.b:0 "Tell the Emperor we're... busy or something..." 

qiefor.41.t:0 "Tibet Offers to Swear Fealty"
qiefor.41.d:0 "Tibet has recently sworn in a new governing party, the 'Young Tibet Party'. They have taken a pro-Monarchy stance and have decided to reach out to us for aid and support. While Tibet is certainly far-flung, collaboration with their regime certainly would not be harmful."
qiefor.41.a:0 "Sure. Send them some token of our appreciation."
qiefor.41.b:0 "Who cares about Tibet?"

qiefor.42.t:0 "The Qing Accept!"
qiefor.42.d:0 "The Qing have accepted our request, and sent us some financial aid."
qiefor.42.a:0 "Great!"

qiefor.43.t:0 "The Qing Refuse!"
qiefor.43.d:0 "The Qing have refused our request, claiming Tibet is an integral part of China!"
qiefor.43.a:0 "Damn!"

qiefor.44.t:0 "How to Approach Tibet?"
qiefor.44.d:0 "With our victory over Japan and our new centralization efforts, we must now decide how to approach Tibet. Do we demand they join our country fully, or leave them independent and autonomous, albeit under our 'supervision'?"
qiefor.44.a:0 "Keep them autonomous"
qiefor.44.b:0 "Direct rule!"

qiefor.45.t:0 "The Qing Demand we Surrender some Autonomy!"
qiefor.45.d:0 "Beijing has demanded that we submit fully to their rule, though we will still remain somewhat autonomous. This is probably the best deal we can hope to get."
qiefor.45.a:0 "Submit, we have no choice."
qiefor.45.b:0 "We will destroy them!"

qiefor.46.t:0 "Qing Demands we Join the Empire!"
qiefor.46.d:0 "The Qing, citing our past cooperation, have demanded we officially join the Empire, and submit to direct rule from Beijing!"
qiefor.46.a:0 "We have no choice, accept."
qiefor.46.b:0 "We will destroy them!"

qiefor.47.t:0 "Tibet Accepts"
qiefor.47.d:0 "Tibet has accepted our demand, and we have begun to carry out integrating Tibet."
qiefor.47.a:0 "Great!"
qiefor.47.b:0 "Great!"

qiefor.48.t:0 "Tibet Refuses!"
qiefor.48.d:0 "Tibet has refused our generous request! We must destroy these insolent yak herders!"
qiefor.48.a:0 "Crush them!"

qiefor.49.t:0 "[From.GetName] Demands our Integration!"
qiefor.49.d:0 "The rulers of Beijing have demanded that [ROOT.GetLeader] directly integrate his administration into the larger [From.GetAdjective] administration. We can accept, try and negotiate our autonomy, or refuse outright - though this will carry grave consequences."
qiefor.49.a:0 "Submit and play as [From.GetName]."
qiefor.49.b:0 "Try and negotiate for autonomy."
qiefor.49.c:0 "Refuse!"

qiefor.50.t:0 "[From.GetName] Attack Macau!"
qiefor.50.d:0 "Early this morning [From.GetAdjective] troops began an attack on the outer fortifications of Macau, flagrantly violating our territorial integrity and international law! No doubt they are taking advantage of our current conflict to expand their influence. What should we do?"
qiefor.50.a:0 "Put up a token resistance, then surrender."
qiefor.50.b:0 "We will fight them!"

qiefor.51.t:0 "Portugal Surrenders Macau!"
qiefor.51.d:0 "Excellent news! Portuguese forces, facing our overwhelming superiority, surrendered control of Macau soon after our attack began. We allowed them to return home unmolested, and now the city is ours!"
qiefor.51.a:0 "Great!"

qiefor.52.t:0 "The Qing Prepare to Launch Reunification Campaign!"
qiefor.52.d:0 "The backwards ingrates in Beijing have announced that within a few months they will embark on a 'National Pacification Campaign'! This is a worrying development, and many are concerned that our allies scattered across China will be destroyed unless we act. [FNG.GetLeader] has announced that he will aid any governor across China who promises to swear fealty to us once we have destroyed the Qing and secured Beijing."
qiefor.52.a:0 "Send the telegrams!"

qiefor.53.t:0 "The [FNG.GetName] Promise to Protect Us!"
qiefor.53.d:0 "In the wake of [QIE.GetLeader]'s proclamation of the 'National Reunification Campaign', [FNG.GetLeader] has announced that he will protect any vulnerable warlords as long as they swear loyalty to him once the war has ended in his victory. We can either accept this deal, or try and weather out the storm on our own."
qiefor.53.a:0 "We need the protection"
qiefor.53.b:0 "We can beat some Manchu on our own!"

qiefor.54.t:0 "[FNG.GetLeader] Promises to Protect Warlords!"
qiefor.54.d:0 "The traitorous [FNG.GetLeader] followed our announcement of the National Reunification Campaign with a proclamation of his own - that he will protect any warlords against our aggression! While this may make our war more challenging, already people are beginning to see this conflict as not just a reunification war but a struggle against Japan as well, and have begun to enthusiastically support the war effort."
qiefor.54.a:0 "We will crush them!"

qiefor.55.t:0 "The Qing Prepare their Campaign"
qiefor.55.d:0 "Our erstwhile allies in Beijing have announced that they will soon embark on a 'National Pacification Campaign' - targeting [LEP.GetLeader]'s regime in the process. Should we send him aid in order to resist the Manchu attacks?"
qiefor.55.a:0 "Send some supplies"
qiefor.55.b:0 "They can beat some nomadic savages..."

qiefor.56.t:0 "Singapur sends Aid!"
qiefor.56.d:0 "Following the Qing's proclamation of the 'National Pacification Campaign', [GEA.GetLeader] has directed his agents to supply us with large caches of weapons - with none of the usual promises for repayment demanded. It appears they greatly fear the resurgent Manchu, and are going to use us as a bulwark against them."
qiefor.56.a:0 "Thanks!"

#Anqing events
qiefor.57.t:0 "Wuchang-Anqing Development"
qiefor.57.d:0 "Following a suggestion by one of our officials of the China Council in the Anqing Clique, work has begun on developing the Wuchang-Anqing region, which serves as the interior of both our nations. Previous development and cooperation has usually revolved around the Beijing-Nanjing axis, but it is good that there is now also progress on developing other areas."
qiefor.57.a:0 "Let them do most of the work"
qiefor.57.b:0 "Invest ourselves"

qiefor.58.t:0 "New Offices Beijing Liaison Council"
qiefor.58.d:0 "The Anqing Clique has emerged victorious with our support. We recently installed the Beijing Liaison Council as our official representative organization in the new Anqing capital of Nanjing. They will be working towards achieving eventual unification. However, they have now requested that in order to make a statement and show the glory of the Emperor to the Chinese commoners in Nanjing, we should fund the construction of very large offices for them."
qiefor.58.a:0 "No, not worth it"
qiefor.58.b:0 "Fund construction"

qiefor.59.t:0 "Resource Development with Anqing"
qiefor.59.d:0 "We have recently struck a deal with Anqing to stimulate Qing enterprises to aid in the prospecting and development of resources in their territory. Now, we of course indirectly benefit from these resources as we can trade with Anqing, but shouldn't we get some direct benefits as well? We could ask for control over one of their iron mines in Wuhu. Maybe they will be willing to accommodate us."
qiefor.59.a:0 "No, it doesn't cost us anything"
qiefor.59.b:0 "Yes, ask them for steel from Wuhu"

qiefor.60.t:0 "Anqing Refuses Special Treatment"
qiefor.60.d:0 "The Beijing Liaison Council has been hard at work to improve the ability of Qing enterprises to do business in the Anqing Clique. Due to the backwards nature and governance of the Anqing Clique, this is sometimes quite difficult. However,when recently the Liaison Council requested the Anqing Clique to do something about this, they outright refused! This is unacceptable. We should send them another offer. One they can't refuse."
qiefor.60.a:0 "Send the offer"

qiefor.61.t:0 "Anqing Still Refuses"
qiefor.61.d:0 "Somehow, they refused an offer they weren't supposed to refuse. As a result, through coordination with the Beijing Liaison Council, we have temporarily implemented extremely far-reaching restrictions for Anqing companies operating within our borders. While we will make sure our own economy is not hit, we will prevent any kind of profit flowing to Anqing for at least the next few months. This will surely make them unhappy, but it should teach them for next time."
qiefor.61.a:0 "Do it"

qiefor.62.t:0 "Puyi Receives Warm Welcome in Nanjing"
qiefor.62.d:0 "Emperor Puyi recently visited the Southern Capital, Nanjing, together with Wu Peifu. There they met with Chen Tiaoyuan, who made sure that he received an incredibly warm welcome. That is most definitely an excellent sign of things to come. In fact, Puyi has been so delighted that he has asked Chen Tiaoyuan if an extensive imperial palace could be constructed in Nanjing."
qiefor.62.a:0 "Excellent"

qiefor.63.t:0 "Puyi Shocked by Protests in Nanjing"
qiefor.63.d:0 "Emperor Puyi recently visited the Southern Capital, Nanjing, together with Wu Peifu. There they met with Chen Tiaoyuan, leader of the Anqing Clique. However, to both the Emperor's and Wu's dismay, the streets were littered by protests. It was obvious that either Chen did not have things under control or he simply didn't care to provide a proper welcome for Puyi. Both scenarios are scandalous and require correction. The Beijing Liaison Council has received orders to make sure that Chen pays for this."
qiefor.63.a:0 "Bad manners"

qiefor.64.t:0 "Chen Agrees with Intellectuals"
qiefor.64.d:0 "The intellectual gathering organized by the Beijing Liaison Council in Nanjing was a great success. Such a success even, that Chen Tiaoyuan himself announced that he agrees with their sentiment and will do all he can to accelerate the timeline. Hopefully he isn't lying."
qiefor.64.a:0 "Good news"

qiefor.65.t:0 "Chen Stresses His Autonomy"
qiefor.65.d:0 "Recently, the Beijing Liaison Council in Nanjing organized a meeting of various famous Chinese intellectuals. They all came to the same conclusion: China must unite immediately. However, Chen Tiaoyuan, leader of Anqing, has spoken out against the urgency of their call. Instead, he says that local autonomy is more important than unification. What he says is practically a renunciation of his recognition of the Qing as sole national government! We cannot let him get away with such words and must speak against it immediately."
qiefor.65.a:0 "Prepare a counter-message"

qiefor.66.t:0 "The Qing Reach Out"
qiefor.66.d:0 "Tensions are mounting in the north, with Qing afraid that it might be attacked by Fengtian, or even Japan. They are looking for allies and as we have not forgotten their help in the League war, have now come to us. Will we accept their request and enter into an alliance with them?"
qiefor.66.a:0 "Of course"
qiefor.66.b:0 "No!"

qiefor.67.t:0 "The Qing Reach Out"
qiefor.67.d:0 "Now that Qing is under attack from the outside, they have requested us to enter into an alliance with them and participate in the defense of China. If we don't help, China might get overrun. We really have no choice."
qiefor.67.a:0 "Of course"
qiefor.67.b:0 "No!"

qiefor.68.t:0 "The Qing Reach Out"
qiefor.68.d:0 "So far, we have evaded being integrated by Qing. However, now they have emerged victorious in their other major conflict, meaning that we are most likely next."
qiefor.68.a:0 "Of course"
qiefor.68.b:0 "No!"

qiefor.69.t:0 "Chen Refuses Alliance"
qiefor.69.d1:0 "Chen Tiaoyuan, leader of the Anqing Clique, has refused our request for an alliance. This is hard to believe, but true. There is little we can do now, as we do not wish to blow up our relationship, but we will make sure he accepts next time."
qiefor.69.d2:0 "Chen Tiaoyuan, leader of the Anqing Clique, has refused our request for an alliance. This is hard to believe, but true. There is little we can do now, as we are at war, but we will make he bends the knee after we have emerged victorious."
qiefor.69.d3:0 "Chen Tiaoyuan, leader of the Anqing Clique, has refused our request for an alliance. This even after we have defeated China's greatest enemy and shown that we are the rightful government! We cannot show any weakness."
qiefor.69.a:0 "He will pay for this"

qiefor.70.t:0 "Anqing Canal Cooperation"
qiefor.70.d:0 "The Beijing Liaison Council has again been successful. It noticed that Anqing had recently completed significant dike and canal work, including the completion of the massive Subei Canal. It was then able to secure Anqing cooperation in dike works in Hebei and Kaifeng. Work can begin as soon as we want."
qiefor.70.a:0 "Excellent"

qiefor.71.t:0 "Army Cooperation with Anqing"
qiefor.71.d:0 "Anqing are now part of our alliance and the next obvious step was closer army cooperation. They have now taken that step and the Beijing Liaison Council has set up the Army Cooperation Commission. Now, it is up to us if we want to expend resources to improve the Anqing armies, as they are quite outdated and based very much on age-old warlord tactics. The benefits are clear, as not only would it improve their fighting capabilities in war, it would also afford us valuable influence over them."
qiefor.71.a:0 "We'll help them"
qiefor.71.b:0 "They'll have to manage on their own"

qiefor.72.t:0 "Anqing Refuses Further Army Cooperation"
qiefor.72.d:0 "Unfortunately, Anqing has refused further army cooperation for now. However, they must eventually realize that this cooperation is critical if a strong defence is to be mounted against our common enemies. We can try again in the future."
qiefor.72.a:0 "Alright"

qiefor.73.t:0 "Army Cooperation Concluded"
qiefor.73.d:0 "Projects began by the Army Cooperation Commission that sought to intensify army cooperation and communication between the Qing and Anqing forces have now concluded. While of course more would have always been preferable, we can be satisfied with the results and the improvements to the Anqing armies."
qiefor.73.a:0 "That's good"

qiefor.74.t:0 "Anqing Refuses Conference"
qiefor.74.d:0 "Strangely, Chen Tiaoyuan has outright denied holding a conference to discuss our country's future. This is quite outrageous not something we expect from a man like Chen. We have to make sure he stays in our orbit. We won't forget he did this."
qiefor.74.a:0 "Damn him!"

qiefor.75.t:0 "End of the Conference"
qiefor.75.d1:0 "The conference was a complete success! Chen was very willing on multiple fronts and the progress made has been tremendous. This event will most definitely be remembered as critical in China's history, as it marked the beginning of accelerated integration between the Northern and Southern Zhili."
qiefor.75.d2:0 "The conference was a success, although maybe not as much as we had hoped for. Chen Tiaoyuan and other delegation members were willing to accept some of our proposals, but refused even more. This is unfortunate, but we still made some significant progress."
qiefor.75.d3:0 "Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, most of our actual proposals have been refused by the Anqing delegation. This entire conference is a complete political failure. This is frustrating, as it seemed that Chen was willing to continue integration talks!"
qiefor.75.a:0 "Good news"
qiefor.75.b:0 "Damn!"

qiefor.76.t:0 "Dalu Yinhang and Anqing"
qiefor.76.d:0 "Dalu Yinhang, the Continental Bank, is one of our major commercial banks. Recently, through an initiative coordinated by the Beijing Liaison Council, they have made significant investments into the Anqing Clique to aid them with expanding their industry. Potentially, we could leverage this to increase our influence with Anqing. First of all, we could offer additional loans through other banks. This might strain our own resources, however. We could also decide to let them repay the loan at more favourable terms. Dalu Yinhang should be able to manage this, but they might not be happy. What will we do?"
qiefor.76.a:0 "Offer more loans"
qiefor.76.b:0 "Improve the terms"
qiefor.76.c:0 "Nothing"

qiefor.77.t:0 "Anqing Responds to Our Offer"
qiefor.77.d1:0 "The offer concerning the Dalu Yinhang loans we made Anqing must have been very sweet indeed. They have accepted and also committed themselves to taking additional steps concerning further integration. That should definitely help make a united China a reality."
qiefor.77.d2:0 "Unfortunately, what we offered was not enough for Anqing, they have utterly rejected it. Again Chen Tiaoyuan has decided to frustrate our efforts, even when it is obvious that it is to the benefit of all of China!"
qiefor.77.a:0 "Good news!"
qiefor.77.b:0 "Unfortunate"

qiefor.78.t:0 "Wu Meets Anqing Anti-Concessionists"
qiefor.78.d:0 "In order to increase support in Anqing for unification with Qing without having to go through its leader, Chen Tiaoyuan, Wu has decided to meet up with a number of leaders of the Anti-Concessions League, the largest organisation representing the usually disorganised Anti-Concessionist Movement. The League itself is split up into two factions, one of which is pro-republican and in bed with the Vermillion Society. The other is more to Wu's taste as it supports the Qing monarchy and believes that unification is necessary as soon as possible. It has been this former group that has been somewhat an obstacle to unification and that is why Wu decided to also meet with them specifically.\n\nThe leaders were impressed by Wu's words and his recent actions and policies within the Qing government. He also secretly confided in them that he also preferred a China without Puyi, but that a constitutional monarchy would mean that both camps could have what they want. He promised them that Puyi would never be able to cause damage to China, Wu would ensure that. Wu's words reassured many and even convinced some who had previously been passive pro-republican to support unification immediately. It was clear that Wu's efforts had a significant effect."
qiefor.78.a:0 "Excellent"

qiefor.79.t:0 "Anqing Reconstruction Aid"
qiefor.79.d:0 "The Anqing Clique has decided to take a cooperative approach to tackling the great reconstruction required to get their country back on its feet. Through smaller initiatives, Qing is already helping and providing significant aid. However, we can also escalate this to the national level and provide more aid there. However, this would most likely constrain us for at least a short while."
qiefor.79.a:0 "Help them more"
qiefor.79.b:0 "Enough is being done"

qiefor.80.t:0 "Qing Requests Integration!"
qiefor.80.d:0 "Now that we are in their alliance and have become very close to their government, the Qing government has decided it is time to complete unification. While a united China is nice, it would mean an almost certain end to our prized autonomy. Will we agree, for the sake of China?"
qiefor.80.a:0 "Yes, unification is urgent"
qiefor.80.b:0 "No, autonomy matters more now"

qiefor.81.t:0 "Eastern China United!"
qiefor.81.d:0 "Anqing has agreed, meaning that Eastern China is finally united!"
qiefor.81.a:0 "United we are strong"

qiefor.82.t:0 "Anqing Refuses!"
qiefor.82.d:0 "Anqing has refused integration! They dare stand against unification, even when it is so necessary in our coming battles. Unfortunately, there is little we can do right now."
qiefor.82.a:0 "They'll come around"

qiefor.83.t:0 "Qing Requests Integration!"
qiefor.83.d:0 "Now that we are in their alliance and have become very close to their government, the Qing government has decided it is time to complete unificiation. Fengtian lies defeated and China has shown it can even keep out Japan. It is most likely time that we now unite."
qiefor.83.a:0 "Yes, the time has come"
qiefor.83.b:0 "No, it will never be time"

qiefor.84.t:0 "Anqing Refuses!"
qiefor.84.d:0 "Anqing has denied our proposal for unification. This even when we defeated Fengtian and kept out Japan. We can wait and ask again, but they won't come off so easy next time."
qiefor.84.a:0 "We'll have to try again"

qiefor.85.t:0 "Anqing Refuses Again!"
qiefor.85.d:0 "Anqing has denied our proposal for unification for the second time. It is clear now that they are traitors to the cause."
qiefor.85.a:0 "War is our only option"

qiefor.86.t:0 "Wu Peifu Turns on Us!"
qiefor.86.d:0 "Following the death of League Marshal Sun Chuanfang, we had hoped that our 'ally' in Beijing, Wu Peifu, would remain loyal to our interests. It seems, however, that he has taken this moment to turn on us, and take an publicly anti-concession stance. While this has bolstered support for his unpopular regime, it means that he has demanded that the Peking-Komission, our lobbying arm in Beijing, leave the city. Facing massive riots outside the gates of their offices, most members have fled to Tianjin! At our embassy, the ambassador has sent all non-essential staff to Tianjin as well, and only a skeleton group of consular officials remain, closely watched by Wu's forces."
qiefor.86.a:0 "Damn him!"

qiefor.87.t:0 "Riots in Beijing!"
qiefor.87.d:0 "Ever since Marshal Wu Peifu refused to intervene in the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces, our agents in Beijing reported an aura of tension and unease, with Wu's angering offending every single major power bloc within his own government. These tensions exploded into open strife this morning, when a group of dissatisfied Zhili generals, allied with a clique of young radical officers and the Manchu nobility, murdered Wu and President Cao Kun, and 'restored' the Emperor Puyi! Even worse, they used this coup as an opportunity to attack Germany, leveraging our unpopularity within the country to bolster their shaky new regime. Massive riots have erupted outside of our embassy and the offices of the Peking-Kommission, and our ambassador has ordered all non-essential staff to leave the city for the relative safety of Tianjin."
qiefor.87.a:0 "Curses!"

qiefor.101.t:0 "Yang Sen Holds On"
qiefor.101.d:0 "Our ally in Sichuan, Governor Yang Sen, has emerged victorious in his province's civil war! This is great news for both Sichuan and our government, as once Yan stabilizes control over the region we can have him re-join our alliance."
qiefor.101.a:0 "Great!"

qiefor.102.t:0 "[SZC.GetLeader] Takes Control of Sichuan!"
qiefor.102.d:0 "Grave news sire! It appears [SZC.GetLeader] has defeated our ally Yang Sen in Sichuan! While this is a major loss to the Zhili Clique, the province is industrially poor and militarily overstretched. Should they join any opposing faction we will crush them!"
qiefor.102.a:0 "Damn!"

qiefor.103.t:0 "Uprisings in Fujian!"
qiefor.103.d:0 "While most of China and the world assumed that the Kuomintang were destroyed in 1927, League-Marshal Sun had been fighting a low-intensity guerrilla conflict with remnants of the KMT since the end of the Northern Expedition in the Fujian area. Reports were censored from the press, and even Wu Peifu remained largely unaware of the true scope of the conflict, with Sun keeping all details tightly under wraps.\n\nWith the current chaos in the League, however, the remnants of the KMT have re-emerged and declared a new campaign of national reunification! They have declared our rightful government illegitimate, calling us'little more than a German puppet, slaving to the whims of Berlin'! We can only hope that the remnants of Sun's forces can put these traitors down."
qiefor.103.a:0 "Despicable traitors!"

qiefor.104.t:0 "Hunan Secedes from the League!"
qiefor.104.d:0 "Hunan province had fallen under the sway of Sun Chuanfang during the chaos following the 1927 Northern Expedition, with Governor Zhao Hengti re-assuming control of the province after a brief period of KMT rule. A long-time ally of Wu, Zhao has been governor of the region since 1920. However, he also has ties to the Federalist 'government' in Guangxi, tacitly supporting the federal model. As of now he has taken a strictly neutral stance, torn between his personal friendship to Wu and his political loyalties to Chen Jiongming. His neutrality, however, cannot last long, as already clouds are beginning to circle around his rule of the province."
qiefor.104.a:0 "Hopefully Wu's old friend remains loyal..."

qiefor.105.t:0 "Yiguandao Take Over Shandong!"
qiefor.105.d:0 "The esoteric, millenarian sect known as the Yiguandao have reportedly taken over the Shandong province, ousting our erstwhile governor, Zhang Zhongchang! While initially concern ran high that this sect would create chaos in our lands, level heads prevailed, pointing out Zhang's well-documented Fengtian loyalty. The cult is isolated, and once the chaos to the south has stabilized we may able to attack them, though this could cause unrest with the sizable number of adherents the religion has within our territory."
qiefor.105.a:0 "Interesting..."

qiefor.106.t:0 "Zhang Zhongchang Severs Ties with Beijing!"
qiefor.106.d:0 "The position of Shandong Governor Zhang Zhongchang had always been tenuous at best. An erratic, violent man, Zhang previously held close ties to Zhang Zuolin of the Fengtian Government, though he had been kept loyal to Beijing through bribery and lavish commissions. It appears he has used the chaos enveloping the south, however, to cast us aside. This morning, a number of our tax-collectors were halted at the provincial border, and spies within the province report he has carried out mass purges of Qing loyalists. Even worse, they report him making contact with Zhang Zuolin and the Japanese!"
qiefor.106.a:0 "Damn you, Dogmeat General!"

qiefor.107.t:0 "Zhang Zhongchang Arrested!"
qiefor.107.d:0 "Earlier today Governor Zhang Zhongchang of Shandong was arrested by magistrates reporting to Song Zheyuan, an outspoken Qing loyalist and Confucian scholar within the province. While normally the arrest of a governor would be a cause for concern, Zhang had well-documented ties to the Fengtian regime and Japan, and many in Wu's circle feared that he would use the chaos currently enveloping the south to sever ties with our government and declare his loyalty to Zhang Zuolin. These fears have been laid to rest, as newly minted Governor Song promises that he will uphold our government in the province."

qiefor.108.d:0 "Sichuan province, long plagued by overpopulation and food shortages, has erupted into civil war! Ever since the 1927 Restoration, Yang Sen, a close personal friend and ally of Wu Peifu, has ruled the province, but in the last few years his control began to slip. Various other factions loyal to the Fengtian regime, Kuomintang remnants, and isolationists loyal only to themselves began to consolidate power, and used the collapse of the League as the perfect moment to launch attacks on Yang's now-shaky government. Yang has yet to reach out to us for direct aid, preferring to hide the scope of the unrest, but Wu expects his old friend to come knocking for help any day."

Under the command of scholar-bureaucrat Chen Jiongming, backed up by the warlord Ma Ji, the provinces declared our government 'wholly illegitimate' and promised a 'swift end to the autocratic and anachronistic monarchy'."

#Flavor Events
qieflavor.1.t:0 "Illegal Brothel Raided!"
qieflavor.1.d:0 "A cold rain fell from the sky as Zhang Beijiao, head of the Beijing Police Department’s Vice Squad, ordered his men to take up positions around a shabby-looking building on the outskirts of the city. Soft music could be heard from within, and wisps of smoke rose from the windows. \n\n‘What do you reckon - drugs or girls?’ Zhang’s second-in-command asked. ‘Both, and I’ll buy your next lunch if I’m wrong.’ Zhang stamped out his cigarette as he whistled loudly. Half a dozen men, burst open the front door and streamed into a dimly lit hall. ‘Police - don’t move!’ Zhang shouted, as men and women in various states of undress lurched into the hall, yelling and crying. The second-in-command frowned as Zhang held up a sack of opium. ‘Guess you’re buying your own lunch tomorrow.’\n\nThe policemen fanned out through the building, arresting the prostitutes and drug dealers. This was a good haul. Opium, hemp, and even cocaine, a German luxury, were found in droves. Just as Zhang was about to order his men to drag the prostitutes and their clients back to the station one of his junior officers called out. ‘Sir! You’re going to want to see this!’ Zhang could barely believe his eyes - amongst the line-up of clients, a tall, blonde, white man stood out like a sore thumb. ‘The German Legation will hear about this!’ he said in poorly accented Chinese. ‘I have friends in high places!’\n\nArresting the man will give the central government some much-needed leverage in curbing German influence, but at the same time be politically costly for the government. On the other hand, who knows what could happen if Zhang lets the man go..."
qieflavor.1.a:0 "Zhang arrests him."
qieflavor.1.b:0 "Zhang lets him go."

qieflavor.2.t:0 "Scandal in Beijing!"
qieflavor.2.d:0 "A few days ago, Hans Schröder, a promising young diplomat in the Peking-Kommission, was arrested on trumped-up charges of soliciting underage and illegal prostitutes. The Beijing Government used this as pretext to push back several German-supported reforms proposed by the Prosperity League, our lobbying group in the National Assembly. While ultimately a minor scandal this has still hit us harder than we’d like to admit."
qieflavor.2.a:0 "Damn!"

qieflavor.3.t:0 "Corruption in the Beijing Police?"
qieflavor.3.d:0 "When Zhang Beijiao made the command decision to let Hans Schröder, the young diplomat in the German Legation in Beijing he found in an illegal brothel, escape free of charge he thought he’d heard the last of the man. But now it appears one of the men on his team was enraged by the lapse in punishment, and reported the news to one of Beijing’s underground printing presses. Existing in a quasi-legal grey zone, these pamphleteers often publish scathing critiques of the Harmony Association’s government through thinly-veiled allegorical poems, historical analogies, and other ‘respectable’ topics, that skirt by government censorship laws.\n\nThis time, however, they published a full-blown attack on the ‘corruption’ of the Beijing police department, and compared the situation to the murder of Lin Weixi by British sailors in 1839, the spark that set off the First Opium War. While we’ve tried to shut down publication of this pamphlet, it has quickly spiralled out of control and has incited small protests and riots."
qieflavor.3.a:0 "Damn!"

qieflavor.4.t:0 "German in Peking seduced by Oriental beauty!"
qieflavor.4.d:0 "Tabloids across the nation are abuzz with a story from Beijing. Hans Schröder, a young diplomatic attaché in the Peking consulate, was apprehended by police after they raided an illegal brothel that also traded in drugs. Furthermore, it appears that the chief of police decided to let Schröder off without as much as a warning, probably fearing political controversy. The city is currently gridlocked by anti-German riots, and many SPD members are questioning the continued value of our involvement in China.\n\nOtto Wels, senior SPD leader, delivered a scathing speech in the Reichstag in response to the scandal. ‘While before the Party’s position was that intervention in China was pointless, it is now clear that the intervention actively harms the Chinese people. Our continued military presence undermines Chinese rule of law, and their attempts to build a stable, functioning country we can partner with against Japan.’"
qieflavor.4.a:0 "Damn!"

qieflavor.5.t:0 "Media Silence"
qieflavor.5.d:0 "It appears that our decision to let the young German we apprehended in a raid on a brothel off without as much as a warning turned out better than expected. The boy was transferred to Tianjin, and Zhang Beijiao, the police officer who let him go, was given a raise to reward his ‘quick political thinking’."

qieflavor.7.t:0 "Prince Rui Requests a Commission!"
qieflavor.7.d:0 "Aisin-Gioro Zaixun, Prince Rui, formerly navy minister during the cabinet of 1911, has come to us with a request. Following the promotion of the young coup backers from the Baoding academy, he requests a full naval commission! While it is true many of the admirals have lingering Zhili connections, they are mostly loyal to us. Zaixun, despite having travelled extensively to study foreign navies has never actually commanded a ship in battle, and many are skeptical of actual naval prowess."

qieflavor.9.t:0 "The Lindbergh of the East"
qieflavor.9.d:0 "A young pilot named Sun Tonggang has earned great renown for flying across Eurasia in his custom self-built aircraft.

qieflavor.10.d:0 "Edith Clifford Williams, an American artist, author, and librarian, has long maintained a correspondence with Hu Shih after the two met in New York while Hu was studying at Columbia University in New York City. She had an immense influence in developing Hu's political thought, and it is suspected (though unconfirmed) that the two were briefly lovers.\n\nWith war ravaging America, however, Williams has written to Shih, requesting asylum and refugee status in China. Hu has accepted, and Williams is currently en route to Beijing aboard a ship."

qieflavor.11.t:0 "The Houmuwu Ding"
qieflavor.11.d:0 "Archaeological excavations around Anyang, Henan Province, have unearthed a massive bronze burial vessel from the Shang Dynasty. Thought to be the largest ancient bronze in the world, its discovery has been celebrated around the world as a massive victory for Chinese culture and history. With the threat of Japan looming however, archaeologists have reburied the sarcophagus, hoping that once we have defeated Japan we can exhibit it safely in a museum."
qieflavor.11.a:0 "A great victory for Chinese culture!"

qieflavor.12.t:0 "The Clique of Strategies of the Warring States"
qieflavor.12.d:0 "Following the ascension of the YCP, an organization made up of intellectuals who have studied in Germany called the 'Clique of Zhan Guo Ce' have emerged. They believe in statism, authoritarianism and Nietzsche's superhuman philosophy, but adapted to Chinese characteristics, promoting an esoteric blend Confucianism with Nietzscheian philosophical thought. They believe that the nation is paramount, but are not racist, adopting a pluralistic outlook on Chinese nationalism.\n\nGroups affiliated with this school of thought have started to crop up in major Chinese universities, and are lending much credence to our new government."
qieflavor.12.a:0 "Excellent!"

qieflavor.13.t:0 "A Late-Night Card Game"
qieflavor.13.d:0 "Night fell over the newly-inaugurated Presidential Palace in Beijing, as President [QIE.GetLeader] and Wu Peifu played an evening game of cards. The two men discussed politics, current events, and the current state of the world. [QIE.GetLeader] played a great hand, while Wu looked at him through narrow eyes.\n\n'You might relish the hand that you just played.' Wu started. 'But remember - who dealt you the cards that led to you sitting in this building?'.\n\n[QIE.GetLeader] raised an eyebrow. 'The Constitutional Convention selected me, of course.'\n\n'Do you *really* believe that?' asked Wu. 'I thought you were far smarter than that.'\n\n[QIE.GetLeader] leaned back in his chair. 'The state is only as strong as its military I suppose. Still - you are not immortal. One day we will need a true democracy, once our period of guidance of the nation comes to an end.'\n\n'We will see' said Wu, lighting a cigarette, and staring out over the city."
qieflavor.13.a:0 "From where does political power grow?"

qieflavor.14.t:0 "An Exiled General from the Qing Arrives"
qieflavor.14.d:0 "While our military does not reach the standard of loyalty seen in Western powers, we pride ourselves in meritocracy. The commanders and field marshals you see on the battlefield have proven their loyalty to the leader and the people. On the other hand, victory could hinge on the deadly will exhibited by some of the more mercenary commanders, those willing to do-or-die. This man comes to us from the tumultuous Qing, whose cliques have relied heavily on mercenary commanders in the past. This general comes with a sob story of how the tides turned against him, and he came ragged to us ready to fight the good fight for once. Whether he is genuine is hard to determine, but we must decide if he is worth recruiting in this already-traitorous times."
qieflavor.14.a:0 "We need all the help we can get"
qieflavor.14.b:0 "No, he could be a liability"

qieflavor.15.t:0 "[ANQ.GetLeader] Affirms our Leadership"
qieflavor.15.d:0 "Governor Chen Tiaoyuan of Anqing formally re-affirmed Puyi's leadership of China today in a radio speech broadcast across his territory. While he admitted initially he found the idea of an Emperor anachronistic, he followed that up by enthusiastically endorsing our new anti-concession stance, and Puyi's devotion to the cause. He concluded his speech with administration for the Zhili leadership. 'An apolitical figurehead can be useful in a modern state. And with Wu Peifu and Cao Kun at the helm of our great nation, we can drive out the foreign scum who have polluted our country, and restore it to greatness!'\n\nThe speech was well received by intellectuals in Beijing and other urban areas, and some have begun to desert the NCERA and YCP for the Harmony Association, bolstering our popularity and legitimacy among the general population."
qieflavor.15.a:0 "Great news!"

qieflavor.16.t:0 "Chen Tiaoyuan - Model Governor"
qieflavor.16.d:0 "Chen Tiaoyuan, governor of Anqing, has consolidated his rule after his victory over the Nanjing Clique in the League Collapse, and while he is technically part of our government, the province enjoys a large degree of autonomy. After the League war concluded, some Zhili generals insisted on directly integrating the province into our government, but this was largely rejected due to the fragility of our own regime.\n\nIt seems now that keeping Chen's autonomy was the right move. He has just announced a massive reform project for the province, promising major industrial and legal reform. The news was greeted with enthusiasm from many business leaders in our territory, as following the German military mission's withdrawal they have sought new markets to trade with."
qieflavor.16.a:0 "Great!"

qieflavor.17.t:0 "Chen Tiaoyuan Seeks to Mend the North-South Zhili Divide"
qieflavor.17.d:0 "Ever since the conclusion of the 5th Zhili-Fengtian war and the German Intervention in 1927, the Northern and Southern halves of the Zhili Clique, lead by Wu Peifu and Sun Chuanfang respectively, have drifted apart. Now Chen Tiaoyuan, governor of Anqing and member of the Southern Clique has begun a concerted effort to mend the divide between the two halves. The top levels of both groups are open to the merger, but the more junior officers may harbor grudges against the other cliques, seeing potential for competition for promotion as the cliques draw closer together. Still, this is overall a good development."
qieflavor.17.a:0 "Excellent"

qieflavor.18.t:0 "Chen Tiaoyuan Proposes Joint Troop Training Exercises"
qieflavor.18.d:0 "Following his efforts to mend the North-South Zhili divide, Governor Chen Tiaoyuan of Anqing has offered to host joint training exercises between our troops outside of Anqing city. His troops have learned much in their struggles against the Nanjing clique, and we both have much to learn from each other."
qieflavor.18.a:0 "Good to hear"

qieflavor.19.t:0 "Former German Factories Reopen"
qieflavor.19.d:0 "After announcing our intentions to nationalize German factories in Beijing, many in our government feared backlash from the German government. Yet with Black Monday absorbing most of their attention, we were able to conclude nationalization with little consequences. We have drawn up plans to distribute factory ownership to a variety of loyal contractors but we now face a question - what should these factories produce? Previously they produced bulk consumer goods to be shipped back to Germany, and could easily be retooled to do the same for our population. Alternatively, they could easily be modified to produce military support supplies such as blankets and cooking equipment, but having them produce weapons or actual ammunition would be prohibitively expensive."
qieflavor.19.a:0 "Civilian goods"
qieflavor.19.b:0 "Support supplies"

qieflavor.20.t:0 "Kang Tongbei Rises to Prominence"
qieflavor.20.d:0 "While Kang Tongbei, the reformer whose works the NCERA are primarily based around, died in 1927, his daughter Kang Tongbei inherited her father's genius and political talent. A graduate of Barnard College in New York City, she returned to China in 1911 to help agitate for women's rights and feminism. As the NCERA gained prominence in the tumultuous years after the German intervention and the Restoration, Kang's idea on women's empowerment became increasingly popular within some intellectual circles, while alienating some of the more conservative members of the party. With our recent efforts to honour her father, some have suggested elevating her to a full minister position within our government, both as a symbol of our direct inheritance of the legacy of Kang Youwei and as a symbol of our modernity. Others counter that this would be too controversial, and instead argue that she should continue to promote her work at the local level."
qieflavor.20.a:0 "Appoint her to the ministry!"
qieflavor.20.b:0 "Let her continue her work at the local level"

qieflavor.21.t:0 "The Emperor and the Zhili: Two Pillars of China's Independence"
qieflavor.21.d:0 "Our recent support of anti-concession intellectual movements appears to have been remarkably successful, with more and more in Beijing's nascent intelligentsia writing papers and pamphlets in support of our government. A personal favourite of Wu Peifu's, published in a journal originating in the  fiercely anti-warlord May Fourth movement, is 'The Emperor and the Zhili: Two Pillars of China's Independence'. A concise tract, it holds up Wu and his clique as bastions of China's fight against foreign domination, with the Emperor as a powerful symbol of China's modernization. Zhang Zuolin and his Fengtian government are denounced as foreign parasites, leeching Manchuria's mineral wealth and sending it back to Japan while leaving the population impoverished."
qieflavor.21.a:0 "Great!"

qieflavor.22.t:0 "Mending the Military's Generational Divide"
qieflavor.22.d:0 "There has long been a generational gap in China's officer corps. Among the older generals, born before the upheavals of 1911 and the ensuring Warlord era, tradition and suspicion of modernization reign supreme. Scarred by the violence and unrest that dominated most of their lives, they are politically flexible but lean conservative, hoping to restore the China of their youth. Younger officers, on the other hand, were born during the Warlord Era, and tend to favour more radical political positions.\n\nOur decision to better integrate the Baoding Army cadets into the Zhili patronage and loyalty systems has paid off, with many of the younger officers abandoning their support for the YCP and joining the Harmony Association. Some of the older generals who were sceptical of Wu's about-face regarding German support have also become more supportive of his regime, owing to conversations with their new, more politically active, subordinates."
qieflavor.22.a:0 "Great news!"

qieflavor.23.t:0 "Wu Peifu Ennobled"
qieflavor.23.d:0 "Earlier this month the Emperor announced a new set of noble titles and awards. Rather than the arcane and opaque system used in the pre-restoration Qing, these new ranks followed a model similar to most western titles. The highest rank of these is 'Duke' (Gong), only to be given to those who have 'Given the Utmost Service or Sacrifice for the Emperor and China'. The first, and so far sole recipient of this honour is to be Marshal Wu Peifu - now Duke of Qi.\n\nIn a lavish ceremony Wu solemnly accepted the honorific from the Emperor, vowing to continue to protect him and the nation for as long 'as he drew breath'."
qieflavor.23.a:0 "Long live the Duke!"

qieflavor.24.t:0 "The General and the Emperor"
qieflavor.24.d:0 "In a highly orchestrated ceremony today, Puyi invited Wu Peifu to the Forbidden city for an 'informal' luncheon. Carefully choreographed to look as 'relaxed' as possible, the two men sat together eating and discussing various matters of importance including modernizing the military, reforming the bureaucracy, and other topics. After lunch, the two men were joined by the Emperor's brother, Pujie, outside the city for a brief ride on horseback. Cameras recorded the entire spectacle, and newsreel footage of the event has already been shown in cinemas in the major cities of China, as well as distributed to international agencies, which will show them that we have modernized without becoming just another Western puppet!"
qieflavor.24.a:0 "I hope they had a nice lunch"

qieflavor.25.t:0 "German-Owned Sweatshops Open"
qieflavor.25.d:0 "Major Chinese cities have seen a dearth of German factory construction following our relaxation of international investment laws. While this no doubt helps boost our economy, a number of them have engaged in somewhat dubious business practices, no doubt motivated the practically non-existent labour laws in our country compared to those in Mitteleuropa. Earlier this morning, a minor scandal erupted when it was discovered that one German factory was forcing its employees to work 20-hour shifts for next to no pay. Even worse, the factory had cut a deal with the local police to arrest and intimidate any worker who complained or made a formal protest, making us look like little more than foreign stooges."
qieflavor.25.a:0 "Oh well..."

qieflavor.26.t:0 "German Railways Receive Praise"
qieflavor.26.d:0 "While many protested the invitation of German railroad engineers to build our infrastructure, a few months on common people have already expressed praise for the improvements to the rail system. Maddeningly complex rail gauges have been standardized across the provinces, and corrupt local station owners who charged extortionate fees for tickets have been fired in favour of a standardized system for prices. Military benefits of a modern rail network aside, the German's reform of our rail system is earning overwhelming civilian praise as well."
qieflavor.26.a:0 "You can always trust the Germans to make the trains run on time"

qieflavor.27.t:0 "Imported Radios Well-Received by Troops"
qieflavor.27.d:0 "Although some in the Finance Ministry balked at the exorbitant cost of importing hundreds of cutting-edge Siemens radios from Germany, our generals report them to be overwhelmingly popular with the officer corps. In a recent action to suppress bandits in the far north of our territory, groups of our soldiers were able to effectively split up and hunt down the bandits using the radios to stay in contact. These radios have immense battlefield potential, and already appear to have had a positive effect on our troops."
qieflavor.27.a:0 "Great!"

qieflavor.100.t:0 "Aisin-Gioro Xianyu"
qieflavor.100.d:0 "Aisin-Gioro Xianyu, better known in Japanese as Yoshio Kawashima, is a Manchu noblewoman and distant cousin of Puyi who has risen to great prominence in the Qing court over the last few years. Despite her young age, she has proven herself an adept schemer and intriguer, and has worked with the Zhongshe Party to advance the goals of the Manchu nobility.\n\nBrought up in a Japanese family after she was given up for adoption in 1915, some around Puyi have questioned her loyalty to our nation. During the Emperor's exile in Tianjin, the young Xianyu pushed for Puyi to work with the Japanese instead of the Germans, a stance that put her at odds with many of the Emperor's closer family. Nearly a decade later, however, many are willing to forgive that as an act of youthful ignorance, and she has quickly made herself a force to be reckoned with. WHAT NOW??"
