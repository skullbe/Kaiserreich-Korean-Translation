norway.1.t:0 "The State of Norway"
norway.1.d:0 "Norway is standing at a crossroad in history. While the nation is relatively prosperous, civil society is plagued by political infighting and stagnation. The left is divided as a result of schisms within in the once dominant Labour party. In 1921 the moderate faction broke away and formed the Social Democratic Labour Party, while the radical syndicalist wing broke away to form the Norwegian Syndicalist Federation in 1923. In addition, the Norwegian Communist Party is struggling and there are rumours about forming a new vanguard party of the far left, based upon the principles of National-Syndicalism. On the opposite end of the political spectrum, several nationalist organisations are jockeying for power and influence. While they are somewhat united in their opposition to socialism, their means and goals differ. While the political infighting has not resulted in violence, the ruling Liberal party is mostly powerless to handle pressing issues due to its minority government. As dark clouds are gathering once more over Europe, the people are anxiously awaiting the election in October 1936."
norway.1.a:0 "Enig og tro til Dovre faller"
norway.2.t:0 "The Economy collapses"
norway.2.d:0 "The Norwegian economy is heavily dependent upon foreign trade. After the Berlin Stock market collapsed, our currency plunged and Norwegian stocks started falling sharply. The reserves of several banks are dangerously low as the public has begun to withdraw their savings. What shall be the response of the government?"
norway.2.a:0 "Do nothing. Let the market recover itself."
norway.2.b:0 "Increase governmental spending and close the banks!"
norway.3.t:0 "State of the Economy"
norway.3.d:0 "Two weeks after the stock crash the markets have finally stabilised. As a result of the abysmal state of the economy, the government has declared it will take steps to encourage growth. However, unemployment is very high and the public is quite dissatisfied with the government."
norway.3.a:0 "At least it can only get better!"
norway.4.t:0 "State of the Economy"
norway.4.d:0 "Two weeks after the stock crash the markets have finally stabilised. While unemployment is high, the situation is not as bad as initially thought. The bank industry is relatively stable and most companies have announced an end to the layoffs. While the public response to the government's action is mixed, it seems we are better off than most of Europe…"
norway.4.a:0 "Let's hope recovery is swift!"
norway.5.t:0 "End of the NKP"
norway.5.d:0 "Today the NKP, the Norwegian Communist Party, disbanded itself. Having failed to capitalise on the current economic crisis, the party decided to disband itself and have its member join the newly created Norwegian National-Syndicalist Party. Based upon the new teaching of politicians such as Benito Mussolini and Oswald Mosley, popularly known as "Totalism", the party hopes to aspire to greater things than communism ever proved capable of."
norway.5.a:0 "Yet another party of the left?"
