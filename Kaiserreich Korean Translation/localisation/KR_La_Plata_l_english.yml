ARG_renewed_expansionism_desc:0 "Our Nation is now ready to reclaim it's legacy; the Viceroyalty of Rio de La Plata"
ARG_virreinato:0 "The Virreinato Manifesto"
ARG_virreinato_desc:0 "Conservative writer Leopoldo Lugoñes has launched today his new book:0 'Manifesto por un Nuevo Virreinato' interprets the recent formation of the Union of La Plata as 'the fulfilment of Argentina's destiny of spreading the light of Platinean civilisation to the other peoples of South America'. However, many of our neighbours will soon feel threatened as we attempt to expand our influence."
ARG_chile_claim:0 "Claim Southern Chile"
ARG_chile_claim_desc:0 "The Chileans have long kept the west coast of Patagonia for themselves. Let us lay claim to those lands and more, citing the oppression of the Mapuche tribes and irregularities in the 1881 Tratado de Límites"
ARG_chile_ultimatum:0 "Chilean Ultimatum"
ARG_chile_ultimatum_desc:0 "Chile is weak, and despite their defensible position in the wrong side of the Andes, we can easily take the lands we claimed. Current tensions caused by harassment of Platine traders can easily be used to issue an ultimatum - Magallanes or War."
ARG_chile_fate_desc:0 "Chile always was part of the Viceroyalty, and now will return to the fold of the union. Their only defence, the Andes, is no longer a factor due to the lands we own in the South. They may resist entry into the union, but our Army does need practice, does it not?"
ARG_chile_fate:0 "The Fate of Chile"
ARG_bolivia_claim_desc:0 "Bolivia has no foundation as a nation state, it's very name is that of a foreigner, its borders a fabrication. Upper Peru will come back to the fold.

ARG_bolivia_fortify_chaco:0 "Fortify the Chaco"
ARG_bolivia_fortify_chaco_desc:0 "Our recent conquest of the Chaco will be fleeting if we don't fortify it against a Bolivian counterattack, especially now that our opinions on their 'independence' are crystal clear"

ARG_bol_pru_ally:0 "Propose Alliance with Peru"
ARG_bol_pru_ally_desc:0 "Peru fears our ambitions on their territory; seems like they misread the Manifesto, after all, we fight only to unite the Virreinato and cleanse the Red Menace from South America. Let us reach out and make amends, to make sure this happens."
ARG_bol_war:0 "War with Bolivia!"

ARG_mesoforts:0 "Uruguay-Iguazu Line"
ARG_mesoforts_desc:0 "Entre Rios will be, in all likelihood, where the main Brazilian push will happen. Our perimeter will be held, and with the help of the Negro line, a wedge will be formed, allowing us to encircle the attacking Brazilian hordes!"
ARG_war_readiness:0 "Prepare for the Final Struggle"

ARG_fabricate_border_incident_desc:0 "Now, all we need is an excuse, a casus belli. In our long and militarised shared border, and incident would not be hard to fabricate. A patrol running after a convict or smugglers, perhaps?"
ARG_uruguay_integrate:0 "Integrate Uruguay"
ARG_uruguay_integrate_desc:0 "Uruguay was not granted much choice in joined the union, it's people resent our rule still. The first step to making a productive member of the union is to normalise its status inside it"

ARG_malvinas_integrate:0 "Integrate the Malvinas"
ARG_malvinas_integrate_desc:0 "Since we seized the islands from the crumbing British Empire, it's legal status has been rather shady. Let us make the Malvinas an official territory of the Union"

ARG_malvinas_citizenship:0 "Citizenship for Kelpers"
ARG_malvinas_citizenship_desc:0 "The Kelpers are not much of a threat to us, and many don't resent us that greatly, given how the Union shields them from Syndicalist and German rule. If we offer them citizenship, and make the Malvinas a full member of the union, we will be able to make our presence permanent. They can call the place Falklands if they wish so, for its La Plata's flag that is at the mast in Puerto Argentino"
ARG_malvinas_develop:0 "Develop the Malvinas"
ARG_malvinas_develop_desc:0 "The islands are still very much a barren wasteland, with nought but sheep and mountains mostly. Let us invest there, and make sure immigrants arrive in Puerto Argentino in ever greater numbers"

ARG_foreign_capital:0 "Attract Foreign Capital"
ARG_foreign_capital_desc:0 "Let us send delegations to Berlin and Ottawa, requesting industrial investments in our country. Surely foreign expertise can only benefit the union"

ARG_agri_concern:0 "Agricultural Concern"
ARG_agri_concern_desc:0 "The large cattle and grains farms of Argentina form a cornerstone of Platinean economy. However, they still haven't fully recovered from the effects of the Berlin Crisis. Our Ministry of Agriculture has developed a plan to increase food output all over the country."
ARG_breadbasket:0 "Granary of the World"
ARG_breadbasket_desc:0 "Let us continue to Export our Goods and foodstuffs, the world needs us"
ARG_no_exports:0 "Prevent Food Exports!"
ARG_no_exports_desc:0 "Argentina gained the nickname 'Granary of the World' because the large amounts of wheat exported to Europe and the rest of America. The government has come under some fire for this, many believe the goods fabricated in La Plata should stay in La Plata for the people of La Plata, not the Europeans who are thousands of miles away."

ARG_motorized:0 "A Mobile Army"
ARG_motorized_desc:0 "Mobility is the future of warfare, or so armchair generals claim. There is an undeniable fact, however, that the lands we need to conquer are far too vast to traverse on foot."
ARG_meca:0 "A Mechanised Army"
ARG_meca_desc:0 "More than merely transporting infantry, our vehicles should be able to hold their ground and defend themselves efficiently"
ARG_armor:0 "Armoured Divisions"
ARG_armor_desc:0 "Tanks were seen as a novelty by many. They were largely ineffective in the Platine War when used by Bolivia. But then again, what isn't ineffective when used by Bolivia? The future of warfare lies in armoured divisions who can quickly encircle our enemies"
ARG_armor_heavy:0 "Heavy Armoured Spearheads"

ARG_special_forces_desc:0 "From the mountains of the Andes to coasts of Brazil, we will have dire need of specialist divisions if our ambitions are to come to fruition. Equipping and establishing such divisions is the easy part, the hard work is training them to their hostile surroundings"
ARG_mil_science:0 "Military Science"
ARG_mil_science_desc:0 "The art of war is an ever changing one, despite the few constants it will always have. We must not be left behind, even in comparison to the Great Powers, for being one is La Plata's ambition"

ARG_air_supermacy:0 "Aerial Supremacy"
ARG_air_supermacy_desc:0 "If we are to revive the Virreinato, we need to control its skies. We will need more than rusty biplanes if we are to achieve this"
ARG_dive_bombing:0 "Dive Bombing Squads"
ARG_dive_bombing_desc:0 "The idea of a bomber that can closely support our land divisions is certainly new and risky, but it's one with great potential"
ARG_strat_bombing:0 "Strategic Bombing"
ARG_strat_bombing_desc:0 "In order to win our war, we will need to cripple our enemy's industrial capacity. The most efficient way to do this is with long range bombers"
ARG_secret_bombs:0 "Secret Projects"
ARG_secret_bombs_desc:0 "Many of our scientists, mainly European exiles, speak of the new advances in physics that would allow us to make bombs of unimaginable power. They request large amounts of funding; would it be worth it?"
ARG_radio:0 "Air-Sea Cooperation"
ARG_radio_desc:0 "If our navy, army and air force are to cooperate in an efficient fashion, we need to ensure that radio replaces pigeons and other archaic methods of communication"

ARG_battleship:0 "Improvements in Battleship Technology"
ARG_battleship_desc:0 "Since the Weltkrieg, battleships have been greatly improved. Our current models could perhaps pass as antiques in Willemshaven!"

### Events ###
arg.1.t:0 "Brazil is defeated!"
arg.1.d:0 "It's seems history does repeat itself, for Platine forces have utterly beaten Brazil in the field of battle! Now we can either sue for peace if we wish so, for the Brazilian government is no position to refuse our demands"
arg.1.a:0 "Sue for peace!"
arg.1.b:0 "We will keep the war going!"
arg.2.t:0 "La Plata in 1936"
arg.2.d:0 "From 1880 Argentina enjoyed a period of economic boom and great prosperity based on the export of wheat and cattle, allowing the nation to achieve a moderate industrialisation, however, this period was ended abruptly with onset of the Great Depression in 1933. With unemployment rising rapidly and many export traders going bust Argentina fell into turmoil from which emerged a strong military cabinet, who seized control of the government in a coup with a pledge to end Argentina's economic hardships and establish the nation firmly on the international stage. Argentina went to war with Bolivia in 1933, ostensibly over the attempted Bolivian annexation of Paraguay, which marked the beginning of the ‘Great South American War'. In 1934 Argentinean troops won a series of victories against the Bolivian forces and easily evicted them from occupied Paraguay, but in response Brazil declared war on Argentina, and her armed forces a rapid advance to the La Plata river, overrunning the tiny nation of Uruguay in the process. However, the Brazilian advance was halted at the La Plata as the war got bogged down in trench systems. In late 1934, Argentinean forces inflicted a further another series of devastating defeats on the Bolivians, and Bolivia was forced to sue for peace before the close of the year. This victory meant that Argentina was free to focus on Brazil, and they began a counter-attack in 1935, which succeeded in routing the Brazilian troops and ejecting them into Curitiba. With her home lands threatened and her forces in disarray Brazil sued for peace. Shortly after this great success the governments of Paraguay and Uruguay were ‘federated' with Argentina, creating the Union of La Plata. In 1936, La Plata is still facing problems, not least that the people of Paraguay and Uruguay don't feel any connection to the Union and nationalism is ripe. Also, an already resurgent Bolivia has begun to rearm, and Brazil's currently weak government looks set to give way to a landslide victory by Getulio Vargas' progressives. Can La Plata stay intact in the face of her so quickly resurgent foes?"
arg.2.a:0 "We live in a golden age! What could go wrong?"
arg.3.t:0 "President Justo has died!"
arg.3.d:0 "Our great leader has died today! General Agustín Pedro Justo, president of Argentina since 1933 and dictator of the Union of La Plata since her formation, has passed away peacefully during his sleep. During the first few hours after the event, a power vacuum ensued. This moment may be seized both by Justo's own supporters on the government, who are trying to setup a stable transitional government; and also by his rivals on the army, who will instead attempt a new military coup."
arg.3.a:0 "Ramón Castillo forms a provisional government"
arg.3.b:0 "Pedro Pablo Ramirez and Eldemiro Farrel launch a coup"
arg.4.t:0 "The Plaza de Mayo Riots"
arg.4.d:0 "While Ramón Castillo was forming his provisional government, the people of Buenos Aires started to gather in front of the Casa Rosada. As the death of Justo was formally announced, the crowd exploded. The police weren't able to control the increasing violence, which ranged from loud discussions to gunfire. As the riot spread from the Plaza de Mayo across downtown Buenos Aires, it became clear there wouldn't be an easy way out of this situation..."
arg.4.a:0 "We will survive the storm, deploy the Presidential Guard"
arg.4.b:0 "The military steps in and represses the rioters"
arg.5.t:0 "The Plaza de Mayo Riots"
arg.5.d:0 "While Ramirez and Farrel were marching their garrison towards the Casa Rosada, the people of Buenos Aires started to gather on the Plaza de Mayo. As the death of Justo was formally announced by acting-president Ramón Castillo, the crowd exploded. The police weren't able to control the increasing violence, which ranged from loud discussions to gunfire. As the riot spread from the Plaza de Mayo across downtown Buenos Aires, it became clear there wouldn't be an easy way out of this situation..."
arg.5.a:0 "March towards the Casa Rosada"
arg.5.b:0 "Recall the troops, let the civilians form a transitional government"
arg.6.t:0 "The Presidential Guard disperses the rioters"
arg.6.d:0 "Despite the menace of a military coup by certain sections of the army, the Presidential Guard stepped in and, without excess force, managed to disperse the rioters out of the Plaza de Mayo, while the Police increased patrols in downtown Buenos Aires. As the situation seemed to calm down, acting-president Ramón Castillo was formally inaugurated and announced his new cabinet, while preparing the ground for constitutional reforms and for early elections next year."
arg.6.a:0 "It's safe to leave home, it seems!"
arg.7.t:0 "Coup!"
arg.7.d:0 "As Ramón Castillo's attempt at a provisional government couldn't even control the vicinity of the Casa Rosada itself, generals Pedro Pablo Ramirez and Edelmiro Farrel marched with their garrisons towards the Plaza de Mayo. Under the excuse of 'preventing a syndicalist uprising by any means necessary', the rioters were brutally stopped and Castillo's cabinet was deposed. The military was now clearly in control of the country. The question now was, how will they govern?"
arg.7.a:0 "It's safe to leave home, it seems!"
arg.8.t:0 "A new government?"
arg.8.d:0 "Today, nearly one month since the Plaza de Mayo riots, the top brass of the Platinean military convened in Buenos Aires in order to decide the future of the country. There are two main factions: the more jingoistic and nationalist officers support the continuation of a junta led by Farrel and Ramirez, while some others insist on adding the more moderate Arturo Rawson to this group. Finally, there are the minority, more radical officers, supporting the reformist and corporatist Juan Perón."
arg.8.a:0 "Mantain the junta under Farrel and Ramirez"
arg.8.b:0 "The moderate Arturo Rawson joins the junta"
arg.8.c:0 "Radical officers choose Juan Perón as the new president"
arg.9.t:0 "Presidential Elections, 1944"
arg.9.d:0 "Today was election day in La Plata. Three main coalitions were disputing the presidency of the Union: first, we have the liberals of the Unión Cívica Radical, represented by José Pascual Tamborini and Enrique Mosca. Further to the right, there is the conservative Partido Demócrata, under Robustiano Costas and Vicente Solá. Finally, there is also the far-right corporatist Partido Justicialista, with Juan Domingo Perón and Hortensio Quijano."
arg.9.a:0 "Unión Cívica Radical - Tamborini and Mosca"
arg.9.b:0 "Demócratas - Costas and Solá"
arg.9.c:0 "Justicialistas - Perón and Quijano"
arg.10.t:0 "Democracy for La Plata?"
arg.10.d:0 "Today, during another meeting of the top officers of our military, some more moderate leaders have pointed at the necessity for elections in 1944, as termed by the Argentinian Constitution of 1898. Should we listen to their demands and, voluntarily, surrender power next January?"
arg.10.a:0 "Of course, we were just a provisional government anyway!"
arg.10.b:0 "Who needs elections? This is OUR country now!"
arg.11.t:0 "Terrorist Attack in Montevideo!"
arg.11.d:0 "Tragedy has struck our Uruguayan Republic as a bomb exploded in a police station in downtown Montevideo, killing 5 policemen and 4 civilians and injuring dozens of others. Intelligence data reports that this may be an act of an anti-Platinean separatist group!"
arg.11.a:0 "Investigate the separatist groups"
arg.11.b:0 "Announce a police investigation"
arg.12.t:0 "Uruguayan separatist group uncovered"
arg.12.d:0 "Our security services have uncovered a terrorist group in Rivera, on the Uruguay-Brazil border, who is believed to be linked to the January attack in Montevideo. The twelve men and women will be charged for multiple murders, conspiracy and high treason!"
arg.12.a:0 "Good!"
arg.13.t:0 "Form a National Guard?"
arg.13.d:0 "The current crackdown campaign on separatist groups in Paraguay and Uruguay has come to an end. In all, over two hundred extremists have been arrested. Reports from our security services suggest, however, establishing a permanent paramilitary force to deal specifically with these groups."
arg.13.a:0 "Establish it"
arg.13.b:0 "That is not needed"
arg.14.t:0 "Earthquake in La Plata"
arg.14.d:0 "An earthquake has just hit San Juan, Argentina, killing an estimated 10,000 people in the worst natural disaster in our history. Can we afford doing anything?"
arg.14.a:0 "Send extra help to the survivors"
arg.14.b:0 "Who cares?"
arg.15.t:0 "Magallanes or War!"
arg.15.d:0 "Argentina wants almost half of our territory to be part of their ''union'' of La Plata! These outrageous demands would throw the nation into chaos if accepted!"
arg.15.a:0 "There is nothing we can do. Cede the provinces"
arg.15.b:0 "War it is! Let us see how well this Union fights!"
arg.16.t:0 "Chile cedes Magallanes"
arg.16.d:0 "Chile folded under our pressure and has given us dominion over Magallanes"
arg.16.a:0 "Everything is proceeding as we have foreseen"
arg.17.a:0 "Chile rejects demands"
arg.17.d:0 "Chile has rejected our gracious terms, and is getting itself ready for war! They will pay for their lack of vision"
arg.17.a:0 "War it is, then!"
arg.18.t:0 "La Plata offers an alliance"
arg.18.d:0 "Platine diplomats reached us with alliance proposal against the red menace. Many are concerned that this would make us but pawns of La Plata, however the red menace does loom over our country"
arg.18.a:0 "We accept this! Today the South American Anti Syndicalist Pact is born!"
arg.18.b:0 "A preposterous suggestion!"
arg.19.t:0 "The Nature of the Union"
arg.19.d:0 "Autonomist protest erupted all along the country when it was a announced that we would be making a new constitution! We need to address this matter in one way or another."
arg.19.a:0 "The union needs more autonomy for its members"
arg.19.b:0 "The union needs close guidance from Buenos Aires"
