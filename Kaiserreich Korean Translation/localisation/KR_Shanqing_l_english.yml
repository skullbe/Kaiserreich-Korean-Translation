### Events ###
shanqing.1.t:0 "A like minded revolution"
shanqing.1.d:0 "In Southern China a new revolution has erupted against those collaborating with the Germans. Although we may not agree on everything, It may be in our best interest to support this revolution and decide who truly rules China later!"
shanqing.1.a:0 "China for the Chinese!"
shanqing.1.b:0 "They are really no better than collaborators!"
shanqing.2.t:0 "Fall of the Qing Empire"
shanqing.2.d:0 "Our long-term friend and potential ally in China, the Qing Empire has fallen to the fanatic rebels who now fancy themselves as the true empire of China, however they are fast becoming a real threat to our colonial holdings in Eastern Asia. On the other hand our spies have saved Puyi who is eager for revenge, maybe we can work out a deal with the Japanese and weaken both Asian giants at the same time."
shanqing.2.a:0 "Call Puyi and contact Japanese!"
shanqing.2.b:0 "This is useless..."
shanqing.3.t:0 "Offer from the German Empire"
shanqing.3.d:0 "Today we received an interesting offer from Germany, they want to form a secret pact with us to counter rise of the new religious fanatics in China. The former emperor of Qing dynasty Puyi, who is currently in exile in German-held Qingdao, has officially pleaded for our support against the rebels. He might be more useful as the rightful leader of the Manchurian people than the shifty Zhang Zuolin who once betrayed us by siding with the Republic of China."
shanqing.3.a:0 "Puyi would make a more willing puppet."
shanqing.3.b:0 "This is useless..."
shanqing.4.t:0 "Death of Zhang Zuolin"
shanqing.4.d:0 "Terrible news, our leader Zhang Zuolin and his eldest son Zhang Xueliang died in a train accident at the outskirts of Shenyang. Following the accident, the chaos was used by to justify a Japanese intervention with the backing of Germany to restore order and use the opportunity to declare the former emperor of Qing, Puyi, as the rightful ruler of Manchuria and its people."
shanqing.4.a:0 "How could this happen..."
shanqing.5.t:0 "Great Empire of Manchuria"
shanqing.5.d:0 "With the help of the Germans and the Japanese the rule of Manchu Dynasty was able to reestablished in their homeland. We are confident that soon the time will come for revenge against the rebels in the south!"
shanqing.5.a:0 "Rebirth of the Manchu Empire!"
shanqing.6.t:0 "Rebirth of the Qing"
shanqing.6.d:0 "Word has reached us that after evading capture by the Revolutionary Army the former Qing emperor Puyi has managed to rebuild his little empire in Manchuria, declaring himself Emperor of Manchuria after the Japanese Empire managed to remove the shifty warlord Zhang Zuolin of Fengtian through nefarious means. The continual Japanese presence on Chinese soil alone offends the will of Heaven, maybe it's time for us to finish the job and evict the foreigners from Manchuria?"
shanqing.6.a:0 "Puyi won't be able to escape this time!"
shanqing.6.b:0 "We are not ready to face Japan..."
shanqing.7.t:0 "Revolution in the South"
shanqing.7.d:0 "With our recent victory over the pathetic Qing Empire, we now must find ways to continue driving the foreigners out of China! Word has it that there are like-minded individuals in Southern China, maybe if we supported their revolution..."
shanqing.7.a:0 "Fund another revolution!"
shanqing.7.b:0 "Leave them be, they cannot be trusted"
shanqing.8.t:0 "Our Brothers have taken up arms!"
shanqing.8.d:0 "Through our smuggling of weapons and supplies we have been able to instigate a revolt in Southern China. Let us remove the German presence forever!"
shanqing.8.a:0 "Our efforts pay off"
shanqing.9.t:0 "War in the South"
shanqing.9.d:0 "Yunnan and the German-led AOG have gone to war with each other. The foreign menace seeks to expand and subjugate even more good Chinese people. We should stop them! Save what we can and fight the Germans however possible."
shanqing.9.a:0 "We must take action, send troops south"
shanqing.9.b:0 "We are in no position to act"
shanqing.10.t:0 "China is Chinese and now it needs one Government!"
shanqing.10.d:0 "We, together with the Republican movement, have thrown the corruption of the foreigners out of our lands. Now we must unite and carry China onwards forever!"
shanqing.10.a:0 "Press for unity"
shanqing.10.b:0 "Our alliance shall stand!"
shanqing.11.t:0 "The Shangqing are pressing for a united China"

shanqing.11.c:0 "Agree, but remain semi-autonomous"
shanqing.11.e:0 "One Government, One Religion"
shanqing.12.t:0 "The Republicans have refused to accept the Mandate of Heaven!"

shanqing.13.t:0 "Unity for China!"

shanqing.16.d:0 "The Shangqing have accepted our offer aimed at unification of our countries. This is a glorious day for FREE CHINA!"
shanqing.16.a:0 "Victory and Peace!"
shanqing.16.t:0 "A New Home for The Path of Consistence"
shanqing.17.d:0 "With the ousting of the Manchurian Qing dynasty from Peking and the ascendancy of Shanqing supremacy over all Chinese lands between the Yellow and Yangtze rivers, enforcing the Mandate from Yan'an has become somewhat cumbersome. Perhaps it is time for The Pure Kingdom Upon the Heavens to find a new administrative nucleus?"
shanqing.17.a:0 "In honour of Hong Xiuquan, onwards to Nanjing!"
shanqing.17.b:0 "Install the Mandate in the Forbidden City!"
shanqing.17.c:0 "Yan'an actually does have its charms..."
shanqing.17.t:0 "The AOG has been defeated"
shanqing.18.d:0 "The AOG has succumbed to our might. Where others have failed, we have prevailed! South China stands united and free, guided by the heavenly light of I-Kuan-Tao! Our victory even inspired some former underground revolutionaries to join our ranks. May those German pigs and their running dogs never despoil our sacred realms again!"
shanqing.18.a:0 "Huzzah! Wansui, wansui!"
shanqing.19.t:0 "Yunnan has been defeated!"
shanqing.19.d:0 "Our brothers of the Southwest have been liberated from that godless warlord scum Long Yun! Enthusiastic volunteers and former soldiers of the clique, having seen the error of their ways, have joined us."
shanqing.19.a:0 "How great is the way of Heaven!"
shanqing.20.t:0 "Fengtian has been defeated"
shanqing.20.d:0 "The Northeast has been taken by our heavenly host! That bandit and traitor emperor-wannabe Zhang Zuolin is history now, as is his clique! He was just like the Overlord of Chu, cruelty and arrogance led to a well-deserved downfall. The people, delivered from their plight, are flocking to Our Great Teacher's cause."
shanqing.20.a:0 "Excellent"
shanqing.21.t:0 "Our great teacher has died!"
shanqing.21.d:0 "Zhang Tianran, our great teacher that has lead us for so long, has died! The Leadership has become divided on who is to succed our Great Teacher between Sun Suzhen and Zhang Guotao. Who will lead our nation?"

### Tian Empire Events ###
shanqing.25.t:0 "Refugees from AOG"
shanqing.25.d:0 "Today a group of refugees from Hunan provinces have arrived stating that they wish to join our cause. Among them was a group which claim to be members of the Zhu family from Changsha. After some inspection and verification of their family tree data we have found that they are indeed related with the imperial Zhu Clan of Ming Dynasty. Among them there is a 18th generation male descendent of Zhu Bian, the 18th son of Hongwu Emperor, the founder of the Ming Dynasty. He is 8 years old and his name is Zhu Rongji."
shanqing.25.a:0 "Place them and the boy under special care."
shanqing.25.b:0 "Conscript them, all Chinese are equal."
shanqing.26.t:0 "Founding of an new Empire"
shanqing.26.d:0 "Our final victory over the pathetic Manchurian Qing dynasty has brought hope and inspiration to the desperate Chinese people in all of the Central Plains, most of them recognise our Mandate of Heaven and are willing to follow our lead. Some of our brothers argue that in order to avoid the same fate of the shaky Republican movement or the corrupted Taiping Tianguo we need to reestablish the imperial system according to the Han tradition with balance between politics and religion."
shanqing.26.a:0 "Proclaim the Tian dynasty!"
shanqing.26.b:0 "No need, the I-Kuan Tao will show us the path to enlightenment."
shanqing.27.t:0 "The new imperial court established!"
shanqing.27.d:0 "Our great teacher Zhang Tianran insisted the young boy Zhu Rongji from the noble lineage of Ming dynasty become the new emperor. Referring to the corruption of Hong Xiuquan after becoming the King of Heaven, Zhang will instead become the Grand Chaplain and look after the spiritual wellbeing of our people, however until the young emperor is ready Zhang will also stay as the Regent of the Empire, Sun Suzhen will become the Holy Mother of Zhonghua and establish the official state church."
shanqing.27.a:0 "Hail to the wisdom of the Grand Chaplain!"
shanqing.28.t:0 "Air force and Navy!"
shanqing.28.d:0 "War with the major powers has shown us the importance of a proper Air force and Navy, we can make use of the resources and plans from the former Qing to improve our own armed forces!"
shanqing.28.a:0 "Reorganise!"
shanqing.29.t:0 "New imperial Capital"
shanqing.29.d:0 "With the ousting of the Manchurian Qing dynasty from Beiing and the founding of the Tian dynasty, enforcing the Mandate from Yan'an has become somewhat cumbersome. It is time to choose a proper capital for the new empire!"
shanqing.29.a:0 "Nanjing, the Southern capital!"
shanqing.29.b:0 "The Northern capital and the Forbidden City!"
shanqing.29.c:0 "Changan is Eternal..."
shanqing.30.t:0 "New imperial Army"
shanqing.30.d:0 "Today Fang Zhimin, the first prime minister of the new empire, held a massive celebration for the founding of the new Imperial Guard of the Heavenly Dynasty. Only the the most experienced veteran fighters from the Anti-Qing Liberation War received the honour of being a part of this spearhead of the new Empire."
shanqing.30.a:0 "Di Guo Wan Sui!"
shanqing.31.t:0 "The grand Chaplain has died!"

shanqing.33.d:0 "According to the reports from the Ministries of Military Affairs and Internal Affairs our control over the central regions is sufficiently consolidated, however the reunification of our nation has just begun.

shanqing.south:0 "Go South!"
shanqing.west:0 "Go West!"
shanqing.north:0 "Go North!"
shanqing.go.en:0 "What we achieved is enough"
shanqing.34.t:0 "Move into Southern regions against the AOG"
shanqing.34.d:0 "With our recent victory over the pathetic Qing Empire, we now must find ways to continue driving the foreigners out of China! Word has reached us that the German-backed AOG in Southern China is currently facing an internal crisis, maybe the time is the right for us to strike them down?"
shanqing.34.a:0 "Time to push all foreigners out of China!"
shanqing.34.b:0 "We are in no shape for a reunification war yet."
shanqing.35.t:0 "Move into Southern regions against the Republicans"
shanqing.35.d:0 "With our recent victory over the pathetic Qing Empire, we now must find ways to continue reuniting the rest of China! The once-failed Republican movement has risen up again and they have managed to establish their rule over the former AOG territories in the south, maybe the time is the right for us to deal with them?"
shanqing.35.a:0 "Their way is incompatible with the natural order in China!"
shanqing.35.b:0 "They are fellow Chinese same as us, there must be a way for peace!"
shanqing.35.b:0 "We are in no shape for a reunification war yet."
shanqing.36.t:0 "Move into Southern regions"
shanqing.36.d:0 "With our recent victory over the pathetic Qing Empire, we now must find ways to continue driving the foreigners out of China! Word has reached us that the German-backed AOG in Southern China is currently facing a new Republican movement, maybe the time is the right for us to deal with the situation and reunify the southern territories?"
shanqing.36.a:0 "Now is the Time to deal with them both while they are weakened!"
shanqing.36.b:0 "First push the foreigners out of China and then we can work out a deal with the Republicans!"
shanqing.36.c:0 "We are in no shape for a reunification war yet."
shanqing.37.t:0 "New Imperial Dynasty from the north are pressing for a united China"
shanqing.37.d:0 "The Tian Dynasty have decided that they alone should rule China, but our differences are great, namely in the areas of government and views on people's liberties and many of our people do not wish to join them."
shanqing.37.a:0 "We refuse - push for twin governments"
shanqing.37.b:0 "Agree to exist under their rule"
shanqing.37.c:0 "Agree, but demand introduction of civil liberties"
shanqing.37.e:0 "Down with Imperialism!"
shanqing.38.t:0 "The Republicans have refused to accept the Mandate of Heaven!"
shanqing.38.d:0 "The Republicans have obviously been too influenced by the foreign powers, we must remove their stain and reunify all of China!"
shanqing.38.a:0 "Enforce the Mandate!"
shanqing.38.b:0 "Leave them be, we are not ready yet."
shanqing.39.t:0 "Unity for China!"
shanqing.39.d:0 "The Republican government has accepted our push for the total unification of our countries. This is a great day for all of China!"
shanqing.39.a:0 "Bring them into the fold!"

shanqing.40.d:0 "The Republicans have accepted to follow us if we promise to introduce and maintain modern civil liberties into our Empire."
shanqing.40.a:0 "Accept"
shanqing.40.b:0 "Fools, We have the Mandate!"
shanqing.41.t:0 "The Legation Cities"
shanqing.41.d:0 "The Legation Cities were the richest coastal cities of China and now they are under foreign control. With the southern provinces in our hand we should try to regain those lose territories as well. There is, however, a problem since the Treaty ports, as they're called, contain significant foreign investments and capital, and it may be unwise to antagonize all the major world powers...."
shanqing.41.a:0 "Demand a full unification"
shanqing.41.b:0 "Try to establish control over their government"
shanqing.41.c:0 "Just let them be"
shanqing.42.t:0 "Demands of the new Empire"
shanqing.42.d:0 "An envoy of the Tian Dynasty approached us in Shanghai. They demanded full unification with the new Empire."

shanqing.43.t:0 "Demands of the new Empire"
shanqing.43.d:0 "An envoy of the Tian Dynasty approached us in Shanghai. They demanded that we should accept supervision of our government by a representative of the Emperor and show some loyalty towards the new Empire in the future."
shanqing.43.a:0 "It's the best we can get"
shanqing.43.b:0 "Those fanatics can't be trusted!"
shanqing.44.t:0 "Legation Cities refuse!"
shanqing.44.d:0 "The leaders of the Legation Cities refused our rightful claims, however, because of their status as internationally-recognised Free Cities, direct military confrontation might bring us unwanted attentions. According to our spies there are reports that the local triad families were originally remnants of the Ming-loyalist and anti-Manchu movements, maybe we could convince them to join us."
shanqing.44.a:0 "Approach the Triad gangs!"
shanqing.44.b:0 "To hell with the foreign devils, attack!"
shanqing.45.t:0 "Criminal Activities!"
shanqing.45.d:0 "In Recent weeks there has been increasing street violence and gang fights, it looks like that the Triad bosses are in some kind of power struggle among themselves."
shanqing.45.a:0 "Guess it's business as usual....."
shanqing.46.t:0 "Gangs in Legation Cities"
shanqing.46.d:0 "The Triad faction which remained true to their roots as a Han nationalist movement was able to unify the criminal underworld of the Legation Cities, their representatives arrived in the imperial capital to swear fealty to our young emperor. They are ready to start the revolt and join the Heavenly Empire!"
shanqing.46.a:0 "Excellent, send our support!"
shanqing.47.t:0 "Revolt!"
shanqing.47.d:0 "A sudden revolt broke out in our main cities, criminal gangs and protesters sweeping the street demanding that the ruling authorities step down in favour of popular, local Chinese figureheads. It looks like the underworld Triad families are behind the revolt with the backing of the Tian empire, as Chinese Imperial forces are building up at our borders demanding us to accept their offer to restore order. It looks like submission is the only option..."
shanqing.47.a:0 "How could this happen..."
shanqing.48.t:0 "Legation Cities accept"
shanqing.48.d:0 "The leaders of the Legation Cities have accepted our demands and promised to be more loyal to the Empire in the future."
shanqing.48.a:0 "Good"
shanqing.49.t:0 "Legation Cities accept"
shanqing.40.d:0 "The leaders of the Legation Cities accepted our demand and joined the Empire."
shanqing.49.a:0 "Perfect"

shanqing.53.t:0 "The Warlord has given in"
shanqing.53.d:0 "The Warlord of Yunnan has given in to our claims and the Empire is another step closer to being complete."
shanqing.53.a:0 "Reunification of China can't be stopped!"
shanqing.54.t:0 "We still haven't heard anything from Yunnan..."
shanqing.54.d:0 "Our messengers reached Yunnan days ago and we still have not heard anything back... how should we proceed?"
shanqing.54.a:0 "One last chance - mobilise"
