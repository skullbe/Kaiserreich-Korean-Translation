### Events ###

fln.1.t:0 "Formation of the Coalition Government"
fln.1.d:0 "Elections have been issued by the Flemish Council for the first time in our recently independent country. Many political movements in our country have seen this as their chance to make it as the main Flemish party. Due to the many contestants it seems that we will not be able to elect a sole winner and a coalition will have to be formed. At 18.00 the last polling stations closed and Van Zeeland has announced the results of the First Flemish Election."
fln.1.a:0 "The Social Democrats have taken the most seats!"
fln.1.b:0 "The Social Liberals have taken the most seats!"
fln.1.c:0 "The Catholic party has taken the most seats!"
fln.1.e:0 "The Liberal party has taken the most seats!"

fln.2.t:0 "Karel, Count of Flanders assumes control"
fln.2.d:0 "Under loud applause and with fanfare has Karel van Belgie taken control over the country an has assumed the position of Graaf van Vlaanderen. Based on the pre-Weltkrieg constitutional monarchy he does not have absolute control and mostly serves symbolicly and to resolve political crises."
fln.2.a:0 "Good Luck Graaf Karel"

fln.3.t:0 "Verdinaso takes control"
fln.3.d:0 "Under the guise of providing stability and prosperity, Verdinaso headed by Joris van Severen has taken control. The party consisting of Flemish Council members has a tendency to stick to strong centralised government spearheaded by their party leader. Whether or not the newborn nation will benefit from this, is yet to be seen but the future will most definitely be interesting."
fln.3.a:0 "Van Severen takes the oath"

fln.4.t:0 "The VWP reorganizes the cabinet"
fln.4.d:0 "With the victory of the French Commune, the Flemish lands now fall under French jurisdiction. A Syndicalist government has been brought to power and they quickly eliminate all remnants of the old system. Parties like the old KB and the market liberals are forbidden and a new constitution is being drafted based on the French example."
fln.4.a:0 "Rise up workers!"

#Zeeuws-Vlaanderen

fln.5.t:0 "The Zeeuws-Vlaanderen Question"
fln.5.d:0 "The Zeeuws-Vlaanderen situation is a tricky one as the Dutch province is located on the southern bank of the Schelde and has a strong Flemish attachment but never accepted integration into Belgium. Now with the independence of Flanders itself, a new push is being made by our government to convince the Zeeuws-Flemish people to join our country, thus securing our access to the Schelde and consolidating our hold on the southern bank. Two main proposals are being looked into : The moderate side of our government insists on pushing for a referendum, letting the people decide for themselves while the more aggressive members look for a more direct path. They want to infiltrate parts of their government and excecute a quick and decisive blow when the time comes."
fln.5.a:0 "The people themselves may choose!"
fln.5.b:0 "Start the Antigoon plan" 

fln.51.t:0 "The Antigoon plan"
fln.51.d:0 "We have designed a plan to secure our rightfull territory and to make sure that the Dutch people won't have the possibility to attack us with the full force of their army. Flemish patriots and nationalists in the Netherlands will be covertly armed and placed at key locations while our army prepares in  Ghent and Antwerp to cut off Dutch reinforcements. By executing a coup on the provincial administration and securing the arsenal of Terneuzen, we will quickly get a grip on the province allowing us to concentrate all forces in our defensive positions behind the Adalbert Canal."
fln.51.a:0 "Put the plan in motion"
fln.51.b:0 "Back down"

fln.52.t:0 "Antigoon excecuted"
fln.52.d:0 "At 1100 AM, a group of well trained nationalists attacked the arsenal of Terneuzen, surprising the guards and infiltrating part of the compound. Meanwhile in Sluis and other villages in the province the town halls were taken by force and quickly secured. The Dutch army however, which was doing some unexpected training exercises in the area, responded immediately taking back the arsenal and preparing a defensive position, awaiting reinforcements from the main army."
fln.52.a:0 "Now is the time to attack, Vlaanderen de Leeuw!"

fln.6.t:0 "The Zeeuws-Vlaanderen Referendum"
fln.6.d:0 "The Flemish government has approached us demanding we tend to the will of our people and hold a referendum in the province of Zeeuws-Vlaanderen. The Zeeuws-Flemish although culturally very Flemish have always stuck with us and are not very likely to abandon us. Nevertheless this may be risky as the will of the people is difficult to determine and "errors" can always happen."
fln.6.a:0 "Hold the Referendum!"
fln.6.b:0 "Respectfully refuse their foolish request"

fln.61.t:0 "Referendum denied"
fln.61.d:0 "The Dutch government has answered our reasonable demands with outright denial, insisting that we have no claim on the region and that the people who live there have been and will always remain loyal citizens of the Netherlands."
fln.61.a:0 "They have refused the people to speak for themselves, attack at once!"
fln.61.b:0 "We have no choice but to back down"

fln.7.t:0 "The referendum proceeds as planned!"
fln.7.d:0 "The Dutch government has agreed with us and are planning the referendum for later this month. Tensions are high on the border with residents from both sides rushing to sign up for the vote and sway the vote in their favour. Nationalist propaganda is being spread by radio and even television, with Dutch newspapers flooding the streets. This will surely be an important day for Flanders and may even determine the course of its foreign policy."
fln.7.a:0 "Double our efforts to help the Flemish people!"

fln.8.t:0 "Zeeuws-Vlaanderen secedes!"
fln.8.d:0 "Pulling in a close victory for the Flemish nationalists, the people have spoken and have decided to join the Flemish. The vote was ultimately decided by just 2 little villages bordering the Gent-Terneuzen Canal who were already very economically dependent on the Flemish country and voted heavily in  favour. The Dutch government has not yet responded our requests for transfer of power and may still decide to call the referendum void."
fln.8.a:0 "One step closer to Great Flanders!"

fln.81.t:0 "The Dutch response"
fln.81.d:0 "Pulling in a close victory for the Flemish nationalists, the people have spoken and have decided to join the Flemish. The vote was ultimately decided by just 2 little villages bordering the Gent-Terneuzen Canal who were already very economically dependent on the Flemish country and voted heavily in  favour. Rumours of election fraud are however coming in and we can still proclaim the referendum void."
fln.81.a:0 "Congratulate the Flemish government!"
fln.81.b:0 "The Flemish have tampered with the results, attack at once!"

fln.9.t:0 "Zeeuws-Vlaanderen remains Dutch"
fln.9.d:0 "With a large majority the people of Zeeuws-Vlaanderen have spoken and decided against Flemish annexation and pro-Netherlands. During the prelude to the referendum and actions by the Flemish government the nationalism of the citizens of Zeeuws-Vlaanderen exploded and even went as far to create their own national anthem proclaiming themselves "a nation apart but still Dutch". The Flemish government is yet to respond to the referendum."
fln.9.a:0 "Congratulate the Dutch government!"
fln.9.b:0 "The Dutch have tampered with the results, attack at once!"

fln.10.t:0 "The Zeeuws-Vlaanderen Referendum"
fln.10.d:0 "The Dutch government has agreed with the Flemish and are planning a referendum later this month, to end tensions over the border region of Zeeuws-Vlaanderen. Tensions are high on the border with residents from both sides rushing to sign up for the vote and sway the vote in their favour. Nationalist propaganda is being spread by radio and even television, with Dutch newspapers flooding the streets. This will surely be an important day for Flanders and may even determine the course of its foreign policy."
fln.10.a:0 "We will follow these developments closely"

fln.11.t:0 "Zeeuws-Vlaanderen secedes!"
fln.11.d:0 "Pulling in a close victory for the Flemish nationalists, the people have spoken and have decided to join the Flemish. The vote was ultimately decided by just 2 little villages bordering the Gent-Terneuzen Canal who were already very economically dependent on the Flemish country and voted heavily in  favour. The Dutch government has not yet responded our requests for transfer of power and may still decide to call the referendum void."
fln.11.a:0 "A victory for the Flemish people!"

fln.12.t:0 "Zeeuws-Vlaanderen remains Dutch"
fln.12.d:0 "With a large majority the people of Zeeuws-Vlaanderen have spoken and decided against Flemish annexation and pro-Netherlands. During the prelude to the referendum and actions by the Flemish government the nationalism of the citizens of Zeeuws-Vlaanderen exploded and even went as far to create their own national anthem proclaiming themselves "a nation apart but still Dutch". The Flemish government is yet to respond to the referendum."
fln.12.a:0 "Congratulate the Dutch government!"

#Frans-Vlaanderen

fln.13.t:0 "The Flemish situation in French Flanders"
fln.13.d:0 "After losing the territories around Lille en Dunkerke to the French during the reign of Louis XIV, the French have undertaken large efforts to halt the Dutch language and marginalize the Flemish speaking community. After the syndicalist revolution many of these Flemish fled over the border to West-Flanders and are awaiting German intervention to return to their homes. Centuries of French indoctrination have however left their mark and only a small Flemish minority still exists in the region making our claims on the region weak at best. Therefore a commission has been created tasked with improving the conditions for the minority and to enthusiasm the rest to adapt to our language."
fln.13.a:0 "We should reconsider this"
fln.13.b:0 "Start our efforts"
