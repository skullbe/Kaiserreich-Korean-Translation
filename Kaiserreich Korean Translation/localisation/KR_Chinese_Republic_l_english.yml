With the eviction of the A.O.G. and foundation of a duly elected government, we have completed the first task in the great undertaking of creating a functioning Chinese state.

repchi.23.b:0 "We must spend more time with Political Tutelage."
repchi.24.t:0 "The New Economic Revolution"
repchi.24.d:0 "With the Kuomintang victory and supremacy in the National Assembly at Guangzhou, we are in a perfect position to reshape the economic landscape in accordance with our political desires. In the Minsheng paragraph of the San-min Doctrine, Sun Yat-sen himself stressed the importance of merging social welfare in accordance with personal liberties into a distinct form of Socialism. Yet that is only one option and the KMT is still divided on the issue."

repchi.25.t:0 "The Liberal Reform Programme"
repchi.25.d:0 "With the success of the Liberal wing in the National Assembly at Guangzhou, we are in a perfect position to reshape the economic landscape in accordance with our political desires. The merchants on the Pearl River and the industrialists in the hinterland of Guangxi are demanding more lax regulation of foreign investment and greater economic liberty for business owners. However, such ideas are often compared to the Iron Rice Bowl policies of the A.O.G."
repchi.25.a:0 "Let the profits speak for themselves!"

repchi.26.t:0 "A New Economic Order in China"
repchi.26.d:0 "Following the Conservative ascendance to power in the National Assembly we are in a perfect position to reshape the economic landscape in accordance with our political desires. The officers in the armed forces and the nationalist reactionaries are demanding a Chinese economy meant for the Chinese and a firm rejection of Western ideals of socialism and liberalism, however, a direct attack upon Sun Yat-sen's ideals might prove dangerous."
repchi.26.a:0 "Economic liberty is essential to Chinese strength!"
repchi.26.b:0 "We must not alienate the KMT, Sun Yat-sen's policy!"
repchi.26.c:0 "The economy is the blood of the state, we must control it!"
repchi.27.t:0 "The Western Expedition"
repchi.27.d:0 "Our six southern provinces have seen democratic and economic development and progress under the wise rule of the Republic's vanguard political leaders. To the West, warlordism remains afoot under the Long Clique of Kunming. Such an affront cannot be allowed to continue. The National Assembly is united in this regard, there can be only one Chinese government, but whether unification should be accomplished with the bayonets of the National Revolutionary Army or through diplomatic channels is still being debated."
repchi.27.a:0 "Deploy the NRA to the border, Kunming must fall!"

repchi.28.t:0 "Republican Armies On Our Doorstep"
repchi.28.d:0 "The peasant rabble in Guangxi have deployed troops on our border! How should we react?"
repchi.28.a:0 "United we stand, divided we fall - recognise the Guangzhou Government"
repchi.28.b:0 "Bah, Kunming is safe - ignore them"
repchi.28.c:0 "Democracy is the harbinger of anarchy - to war!"
repchi.29.t:0 "Long Yun covers before us!"
repchi.29.d:0 "Yesterday, in a thoroughly subdued spirit, the Autocrat of Kunming announced his unwavering support for the Chinese Republic. Our men in the border areas report that the advancing formations of the National Revolutionary Army have only encountered celebration and a shower of flowers and kisses from the young women of Yunnan on their advance towards Kunming. Dr. Sun would have been proud of us!"
repchi.29.a:0 "The Revolution is not over yet!"
repchi.30.t:0 "The Warlord's Insolence"
repchi.30.d:0 "Our attempts at reuniting the bandit lair of Yunnan with the light of the Republic through peaceful means have been rebuked by the Kunming administration. The Hanjian Long and his gang of mad dogs and scoundrels will have to be ousted through the stab of the bayonet and the shot of the rifle so that the Western reaches of China proper may rejoin her six sister provinces of the East."
repchi.30.a:0 "Launch the Western Expedition!"
repchi.30.b:0 "The Passes of Yunnan are closed. Back down."
repchi.31.t:0 "The Offer from Guangzhou"
repchi.31.d:0 "The peasant rabble in Guangxi have announced their intention to enforce a unification with our domains. How should we react?"

repchi.31.e:0 "Immunity from prosecution and sizeable pensions are the price for our loyalty"
repchi.32.t:0 "The Demands of a Bandit"
repchi.32.d:0 "Long Yun has announced to our representative in Kunming that he and his government are willing to allow a peaceful unification in return of amnesty for whatever crimes against the people he is perceived to have committed during his tenure in Yunnan as well as a sizeable pension for himself. An agreement will bring Yunnan under Republican control without bloodshed, but our credibility might suffer tremendously. The entire nation eagerly awaits the Republican response."
repchi.32.a:0 "Blood must not be spilled, we accept."
repchi.32.b:0 "The NRA will bring you to justice, scoundrel!"
repchi.33.t:0 "The Parliamentary elections"
repchi.33.d:0 "Four years have passed since the Guangzhou Revolution washed off the shame of the German Intervention of 1926 in a river of righteous resistance. As per the constitution and the San-min Doctrine Free China is to experience the second batch of elections to the National Assembly and the old guard of parties have been readying themselves for months. However, new claimants to the popular mandate have also arisen in the Young China Party."
repchi.33.a:0 "Soong Ching-ling and Zhou Shuren's Leftist Kuomintang!"
repchi.33.b:0 "Hu Shi's Liberals Secure a Majority!"
repchi.33.c:0 "Chen Jiongming's Conservatives!"
repchi.33.e:0 "The Young China Party carries the day!"
repchi.34.t:0 "The German Companies"
repchi.34.d:0 "The profit-driven capitalist system of exploitation and oppression of the major German companies in Southern China was one of the major causes of the Guangzhou Revolution. Thus a call for the expropriation of the financial cooperatives has been voiced within the assembly. However, certain members of the incumbent government argue that such an act could result in a permanent weakening of our ability to develop our industry."
repchi.34.a:0 "We need their industrial expertise."
repchi.34.b:0 "Expropriate the oppressors!"
repchi.35.t:0 "The Expulsion of A.O.G. Companies"
repchi.35.d:0 "Following the downfall of the A.O.G., the Chinese republican government in Guangzhou has added insult to injury by proclaiming the Asian sub-companies of Krupp, Opel and Siemens unwanted in their 'Free China'. Our reaction to this humiliation must be swift and decisive!"
repchi.35.a:0 "Demand financial compensation!"
repchi.35.b:0 "Well, at least we still hold Tsingtau"
repchi.36.t:0 "The Tsingtau Ultimatum"
repchi.36.d:0 "Our decision to expropriate the German companies has resulted in a list of demands being cabled to us from German-held Tsingtau. In short, the Kaiser demands suitable monetary compensation for his subjects being targeted by our Government. Such a claim is outrageous, but with German Schutztruppen stationed nearby, to seek a direct confrontation with the Kaiserreich might not be the wisest path to tread."
repchi.36.a:0 "Berlin's bluffing, reject the Kaiser's claims!"
repchi.36.b:0 "We must submit in the name of peace."
repchi.37.t:0 "Guangzhou laughs at us!"
repchi.37.d:0 "The demand dispatched by our governor in Tsingtau has been thoroughly ignored by the Republican government. The domestic as well as international press is bombarding us with critique and scorn for not standing up to such disrespect from a puny Chinese clique. The Guangzhou government must be chastised!"
repchi.37.a:0 "Have they forgotten 1926? Attack!"
repchi.37.b:0 "I tell you, they're a cunning race!"
repchi.38.t:0 "The Germans flee before us!"
repchi.38.d:0 "We have driven the Kaiser's troops from our borders and seized Hanoi from the local colonial governor. Our troops are poised to drive deeper into Indochina and with the interior only weakly defended, now might be a good time to offer Berlin peace terms."
repchi.38.a:0 "Claim German colonies in China!"
repchi.38.b:0 "Fight 'till our banners fly over Saigon!"
repchi.39.t:0 "Guangzhou offers terms"
repchi.39.d:0 "The war in China has turned out to be a regular catastrophe. Our forces have been routed from their bases in Haikou and Naoming, whilst Republican troops are posed to invade German Indochina! The Chinese are proposing a ceasefire in return for our colonies in China. Maybe it would be wise to accept."
repchi.39.a:0 "Better than we had hoped for."
repchi.39.b:0 "I want them dead, all of them!"
repchi.40.t:0 "Launching the Northern Expedition"
repchi.40.d:0 "In 1926 the German imperialists imposed the Manchu dynasty upon the northern provinces of China, yet their rule hasn't improved since the Xinhai Revolution. With Yunnan and the A.O.G. gone, the time seems ripe for a repeat of the glorious days of 1911."
repchi.40.a:0 "The Qing must be ousted by force!"
repchi.40.b:0 "Dispatch agitators and demagogues!"
repchi.41.t:0 "Republican troops on our border!"
repchi.41.d:0 "The would be revolutionaries of Guangxi have deployed several armies on our border, threatening the important industrial city of Nanjing. Although we knew such confrontation with the resurgent Republic would be unavoidable, the Imperial council is still debating our means of response fiercely."
repchi.41.a:0 "Insolence, the Great Qing will smash them!"
repchi.41.b:0 "Bah, they will feel our wrath soon enough."
repchi.110.t:0 "Republican agitators within our borders!"
repchi.110.d:0 "Jiangsu province is in complete disarray! Agitators and spies from Guangzhou are spreading their vile propaganda about the imperial house at an alarming rate, and in the foreign concessions in Nanjing revolutionaries are busy making bombs and banners for planned demonstrations against our rule. This cancer of democracy must be cut out, or we might face even greater resistance in our enforcement of the heavenly mandate."
repchi.110.a:0 "Upstarts, the Great Qing will crush you!"
repchi.110.b:0 "A stronger police force in the urban centres will quell this unrest!"
repchi.42.t:0 "Riots in the Capital of Six Dynasties"
repchi.42.d:0 "The infiltrators dispatched by our secret service have managed to rouse the inhabitants of Nanjing and the surrounding areas against Manchu rule. Barricades are being set up in the streets and demonstrators clash with loyalist troops around all the major public buildings. Our general staff is in agreement in its assessment of the situation. With a certain amount of undercover military support, the Nanjing Revolution might actually stand a chance."
repchi.42.a:0 "Smuggle arms and supplies to the revolutionaries!"
repchi.42.b:0 "Enough subterfuge, launch the Expedition!"
repchi.43.t:0 "A new 1853"
repchi.43.d:0 "Horrible, horrible news have just arrived from Nanjing. Whilst our troops attempted to restore imperial authority in the city's centre, rebels opened fire upon our men with automatic weapons. Nanjing is in full revolt and our men have been forced back whilst the Republican five-coloured flag is hoisted throughout the ancient capital."
repchi.43.a:0 "You traitors will share the fate of Hong Xiuquan!"
repchi.43.b:0 "Maybe they are right after all."
repchi.44.t:0 "The Northern Expedition Commences"
repchi.44.d:0 "With one swift stroke, Nanjing and much of Jiangsu province have come under Republican control. However, the Qing have dispatched its lackeys to quell the nascent movement of national revolution and without the direct assistance of the NRA, the brave freedom fighters in the ancient capital might succumb to the immense pressure of the Manchu onslaught!"
repchi.44.a:0 "The revolution isn't over yet!"
repchi.45.t:0 "Fate of the German Colonies"
repchi.45.d:0 "The unthinkable has happened. The German Kaiserreich has suffered a crushing defeat in Europe that has sent shock waves throughout the world. With panic erupting in all of the Kaiser's Chinese concessions and the local Schutztruppen hard pressed to maintain order, now might be the right time to proclaim an ultimatum regarding the German treaty ports."
repchi.45.a:0 "They reap what they have sowed. Issue our ultimatum!"
repchi.45.b:0 "We have no need for those ports"
repchi.46.t:0 "The Chinese Vultures"
repchi.46.d:0 "Dire news have reached our officials in Tsingtau. The president of the Chinese Republic has demanded our surrender of the German territories in Shandong and at the Qiongzhou Strait."
repchi.46.a:0 "Niemals! Attack"
repchi.46.b:0 "Wir kapitulieren."
repchi.47.t:0 "The German Eagle Defends Herself"
repchi.47.d:0 "Our ultimatum has been rebuffed by the German Kaiser, it seems as if we will have to skew the German colonies on our bayonets!"
repchi.47.a:0 "The Chinese dragon will tear them apart!"
repchi.47.b:0 "We have better things to do."
repchi.48.t:0 "The Subjugation of the Treaty Ports"
repchi.48.d:0 "Ever since the downfall of the first Chinese Republic and the resurrection of Manchu rule, the largest Chinese cities on the eastern seaboard have been ruled by a conglomerate of the foreign powers. However, as the star of the western states is fading whilst the Chinese dragon surges to the skies, the possibilities of a reunification with the Legation Cities seem better than ever before."
repchi.48.a:0 "The Legation cities are rightfully Chinese!"
repchi.48.b:0 "Offer them limited autonomy"
repchi.49.t:0 "Republican Ambitions of Reunion"
repchi.49.d:0 "We have received a personal letter from the president of the Chinese Republic calling for our immediate submission. Although we might have a slim chance at gaining international backing in resisting the Chinese policy of reunification, the populace is widely supportive of a union with the resurgent Republic."
repchi.49.a:0 "Unification will open new markets for investment, we accept!"
repchi.49.b:0 "Call on Berlin for protection!"
repchi.50.t:0 "The Legation Cities Carve In"
repchi.50.d:0 "At an emergency meeting, the government of the Confederation of Legations have decided to agree to our demands. Throughout the cities of Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Ningbo people are hoisting the five coloured flag of our great nation whilst the national press is ecstatic in its praise of our successful unification. Finally, some of the shame conferred upon China after the Century of Humiliation has been washed away."
repchi.50.a:0 "Ha zha, what a glorious day for China!"
repchi.50.b:0 "Actually, the Triads are too strong"
repchi.51.t:0 "Republican Ambitions of Reunion"
repchi.51.d:0 "We have received a personal letter from the president of the Chinese Republic calling for our recognition of the Chinese National Assembly as the legitimate governing body in the lands of our confederation. According to the communique, we are entitled to widespread home rule although matters of foreign policy and defence will be decided by the central government. Considering the strength of the resurgent Republican regime, this offer seems too good to be true!"
repchi.51.a:0 "Brilliant, let us comply!"
repchi.51.b:0 "Call on Berlin for protection!"
repchi.52.t:0 "The Legation Cities Carve In"
repchi.52.d:0 "At an emergency meeting, the government of the Confederation of Legations has decided to agree to our demands. Throughout the cities of Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Ningbo people are hoisting the five coloured flag of our great nation whilst the national press is ecstatic in its praise of our successful political gamble. With the Legation Cities serving as a buffer, all claims of aggression are null and void!"
repchi.52.a:0 "Ha zha, what a glorious day for China!"
repchi.52.b:0 "Actually, the Triads are too strong"
repchi.53.t:0 "Republican Ultimatum to Shanghai"
repchi.53.d:0 "The damned Chinese revolutionaries who have already crushed the A.O.G. and our allies in Peking are up to it again! The Confederation of Legation Cities set up after our 1926 intervention to manage international trade with the Chinese market has been forced into a series of negotiations with the Republican regime. The leader of the Confederation's cabinet has approached us, as the prime guardian of Asian stability, to secure German support against the Chinese menace."
repchi.53.a:0 "Ferry in troops from Tsingtau, the Chinese must be stopped!"
repchi.53.b:0 "Fortify our own colonies and leave the Legations to their fate."
repchi.54.t:0 "Germany Moves Troops Into the Treaty Ports!"
repchi.54.d:0 "In retaliation to our ultimatum regarding the foreign controlled Treaty Ports, Berlin has deployed men and munitions to the international concessions in Shanghai and Hong Kong. We are faced with either a massive prestige loss or outright war with at least one of the major powers in South East Asia. Now is truly a dark hour for the growing republic."
repchi.54.a:0 "Back down, this is not worth a war."
repchi.54.b:0 "Attack, attack, attack!"
repchi.55.t:0 "Germany Betrays Shanghai!"
repchi.55.d:0 "In a stunning display of treachery and cowardice, the Kaiser has sold us out to the Republican menace!"
repchi.55.a:0 "Lay down our arms."
repchi.55.b:0 "As we brought down the Boxers so we shall crush them too!"
repchi.56.t:0 "Double Ten Day"
repchi.56.d:0 "Today, the tenth day of the tenth month is the anniversary of the 1911 Xinhai Uprising. Posters of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and other revolutionaries decorate the streets of Guangzhou and beyond whilst the people cheer the lion and dragon dancers parading under the five coloured flag. Today, our Republic is truly united!"

repchi.57.t:0 "Civil War!"
repchi.57.d:0 "The Heavenly Crusade to purify China has entered a critical stage where our troops will have to fight the stubborn plutocrats of Canton.

repchi.57.a:0 "The Path of Consistence shall triumph!"
repchi.58.t:0 "The Manchurian Plebiscite"
repchi.58.d:0 "Following the establishment of Republican hegemony over much of Inner China, the National Assembly has instigated a formal debate on the status of the so-called Fengtian Republic. So far we have been very clear regarding our stance towards warlordism, but the Manchurian junta has the support of the Japanese Empire. Our position is dangerous and the cabinet is expected to conclude upon a course within hours. Some propose a peaceful referendum, others prefer sending in the NRA."

repchi.59.d:0 "Events are unfolding at an alarming pace on the Chinese mainland. The government of the Republic of China has announced its desire for a popular referendum to be held in order to decide whether or not the Fengtian Republic should rejoin China proper.

repchi.96.d:0 "Directed by Cai Chusheng and Zheng Junli, The Spring River Flows East is a two part epic movie depicting the hardships of a poor working class couple during the trials and tribulations of the Chinese Unification. Portraying the corruption that greed and power holds over the people, the movie's message has been interpreted by many as a direct attack upon the policies of the Liberal party. However, the film has been a smashing success at the box office as well as with the critics."

repchi.99.t:0 "Republic of China wants to partition Mongolia"
repchi.99.d:0 "We have received a special delegation from China. The democratic China wants to 'liberate' Mongolia. They are not convinced that they can do this alone, so they asked us for help. This could be our chance to liberate the occupied Trans-Siberian Railroad"
repchi.99.a:0 "Refuse to attack Mongolia"
repchi.99.b:0 "We have longstanding tradition in partitions, how we could miss this"
repchi.100.t:0 "Russia refused to partition Mongolia"

repchi.104.d:0 "It's been hundreds of years since Macao became a Portuguese holding in 1557 by purchasing it from the Jiajing Emperor of the Ming dynasty. Today, the Second Republic is strong enough to demand Macau from Portuguese. In the name of national unity, we should press Portugal for cession of Macao."
repchi.104.a:0 "It belongs to China!"
repchi.104.b:0 "Let the idea slide"
repchi.105.t:0 "RoC demands"
repchi.105.d:0 "After centuries, the reborn Republic of China decided to demand Macao from us. The Second Republic is now probably one of the strongest states in the Far East and fighting them over control of Macau is probably not a good idea."
