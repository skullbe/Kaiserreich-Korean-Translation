literature.2.t:0 "Diary of a Country Priest - newest Book of Georges Benanos"
literature.2.d:0 "The history of French literature is unique. It is comprised of centuries of great masterpieces, which deliver to the reader ultimate feelings. The newest book, promoted very hard by the Arts' Highest Bureau, is about a Catholic priest who, after new acts on religion are passed after Second Revolution, comes to a village and tries to spread the word of God. Unfortunately, the government has sent a young syndicalist activist to teach the village about the blessings of Marxism, as well. Soon, a love triangle forms between the priest, the agitator and the daugther of a wealthy Kulak. The story ends on a happy note, as the priest loses his faith and becomes a mechanic, and the agitator and the girl start new happy life together with Marx. Critics from non-syndicalist countries say that this is an utter piece of propaganda and that the story it tells is rubbish, however, the common folk of Syndie France are taking quite a liking to it."

However, just when they finish high school, Japan is readying herself for war, and the boy is called to join the Navy. The two have to part from each other, Marin staying at home. Only now that they're seperated, they notice their feelings for each other, but struggle to express them in the few letters they can exchange. Just when the war draws to a close, and Marin yearns for her loved one's return, his letters stop coming.\n\nWhile the book does not represent the highest of Japanese literature, it gives an astonishingly detailed insight to both the daily lives of a farmer's daughter in rural Japan and of a Japanese Navy Marine. The book is scheduled to be translated to German, English and Russian."
