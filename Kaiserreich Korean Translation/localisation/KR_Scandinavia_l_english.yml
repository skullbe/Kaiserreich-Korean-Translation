The Conservative Party is promising to cut taxes and increase military spending. They are also in favour of maintaining the current status of the federation. Lastly, the Scandinavian Peoples Party is a mixture of politicians and ideas, only united by their common dedication to Scandinavism. They wish to increase the power of the federation and conduct an active foreign policy to unite all Scandinavians in a single state. Who will win?"

Northern Schleswig, which is mainly populated by Danes, has already sent a delegation to Copenhagen, requesting to join our country. The question is what to do with the rest of the state. Since it contains a clear German majority, an annexation is out of the question. The idea of restoring the Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein under a Danish prince might be the best solution."

scandinavia.110.b:0 "Continue with Military Occupation"
