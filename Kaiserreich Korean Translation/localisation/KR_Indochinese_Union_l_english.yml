INC_vietminh_desc:0 "The 'Viet Minh', or 'League for the Independence of Vietnam', is a broad coalition government of groups which seek the immediate independence of Vietnam.

Thousands of lives already proved that the colonial regime won't yield till the bitter end. The Viet Minh is determined to led fight this national resistance war against German bandits, and that calls for the will of all Indochinese people-Vietnamese, Laotian, Cambodian, Muong, Tay...to pay the ultimate sacrifice in service to the just cause.\n\n(Since you have a coalition government, the popularity of you government won't be affected by the popularity of ruling party)"

viet.1.d:0 "As our national salvation war against German bandits begin, we are going to form an independent sovereign state. While few Cambodians and Laotian have joined us, the revolutionaries agreed that the newly established state should represent the whole Indochina and devoted to the liberation of Indochinese people.\n\nThe revolutionaries decided to draft an Indochinese Declaration of Independence. The radical revolutionaries urge an expression of our solidarity with the Internationale. Meanwhile, VNQDD and other nationalists wanted to declare Pan-Asianist ambition. While strongly devoted to internationalism, syndicalist leader Ta Thu Thau believes in the need for a tactical compromise——A moderate declaration will win the support home and abroad."

viet.2.d:0 "Among all the revolutionaries and patriots in the Viet Minh, four factions stand out:\n\nAfter the crackdown in 1926, Ho Chi Minh's Revolutionary Youth League suffered from internal split. The Indochinese Revolutionary League is its direct successor. Adhering to orthodox anarcho-syndicalism, the current leader Ta Thu Thau, recently returned from France, succeeded in organizing trade unions in Saigon and some other cities.\nInfluenced by the French Jacobins, some hard-liners broke away from the League in the 1931 Paris Conference and formed New Viet Revolutionary Party, or Tan Viet. Tan Viet believed in the virtue of iron discipline and secret movement. As a result, Tan Viet proved to be effective in infiltrating the colonial police and garrison.\nVNQDD, the Vietnamese Nationalist Party, is modeled after the Chinese Nationalist Party or KMT. The party is popular among the petit bourgeoise and wealthy farmers, especially in the northern Vietnam. The failed Yen-Bai mutiny decimated the party, but also win them heroic reputation.\nIn 1928, Nguyen An Ninh, a prominent anarchist revolutionary founded the Aspiration Youth. Convinced that syndicalism cannot win the revolution, he modeled on traditional secret societies to agitate the revolutionary spontaneity of peasants. While its anarchist ideal attracted many intellectuals, their connections to the rural area played a key role in the revolution and ensure their dominance in Viet Minh.\n\nWhile the initial euphoria unites everyone, only time can tell whether this unity will endure the forthcoming challenges."

viet.3.t:0 "Anti-Infiltration Campaign"
viet.3.d:0 "The German scums want to sabotage our glorious revolution. Spies and traitors are everywhere. While VNQDD wants to infiltrate the enemy, and launch an intelligence counter-offensive, the Tan Viet party argues that expand our secret police is the only way to eliminate internal enemies.

Nationalists argue for rent reduction for tenants but maintaining our relationship with patriotic landlords. However, radicals want a complete land reform to mobilise the peasants and eliminate the Ancien Régime in every village. The fierce debate on the land policy is splitting the coalition. Ta Thu Thau and Pham Van Dong suggested a compromise by confiscating the land of 'traitors' for now and conduct land reform in the future."

Many of our soldiers are equipped with hatchets and spears. Tan Viet party inherit the transnational underground revolutionary network developed by the old league in the 1920s.

Now, the first national election in the Indochinese history, against all odds, has been conducted in such an emergent situation.

She has been secretly funding anti-colonial movements for a long time. However, when our army was advancing, the workers in her plantations rose up and captured her. They, along with over five thousand peasants from neighbouring communes, crammed together and set up a revolutionary tribunal. Under the red banner "Overthrow the despotic landlord Nguyen Thi Nam, take back the land for the peasants," they pronounced her death penalty. Our soldiers stopped the execution, but an immediate decision needs to be made."

viet.8.d.a:0 "Deeply resenting our just social revolution, some insidious VNQDD traitors conspired to launch a coup against us. These self-claimed nationalists organised some anti-syndicalist bandits called National Salvation Corps to march on Saigon and occupy some government buildings. Our Vietminh leaders have to evacuate. However, the heroic worker militias in Saigon refused to surrender. They recapture the buildings and repelled those fools! We have launched a purge against those traitors."
viet.8.d.b:0 "Deeply resenting our just social revolution, some insidious VNQDD traitors conspired to launch a coup against us. These self-claimed nationalists tried to organise some bandits called National Salvation Corps to march on Saigon and overthrow our government, but the conspiracy was detected by our secret police. Secret police preempted the conspirators and arrested most of them. We have launched a purge against those traitors."

The novel follows the absurd and unexpected rise within colonial society of a street-smart vagabond named Red-haired Xuan. The idiotic Xuan's use of rhetorics like 'civilisation' and 'modern citizen' allowed him ascending to intellectual society of Indochina. It also ridiculed the revolutionaries in the early 1930s. The novel, despite its popularity among common readers, turned out to be very politically provocative. This book is criticised as degenerate by some intellectuals and its revolutionary merits are questioned. The critics also claimed that a character in the book, the Cochinchinese King of Visceral Disease Treatment is ridiculing Nguyen An Ninh who sold self-made ointment when conducting revolution in the Mekong delta."

There were rumors that Ho Chi Minh actually escaped from that disaster and hid in southern China organising a guerrilla. Although it might be unlikely that he is still alive, people still wonder about Brother Ho's fate. With the help of a friendly Chinese government, it's now possible to conduct an investigation in southern China of this..."

Among those released guerillas, one man named Hu Guang left his diary to a local intellectual who helped him during the prison time. We confirmed that the diary is actually written by Ho Chi Minh.

After the crackdown in 1926, Ho continued to conduct guerrilla warfare in southern China. The guerrilla was suppressed by Guangxi warlords and Ho was arrested. However, the warlord didn't know who is him and released him. Comrade Ho decided to leave China for France but he was captured by the Legation city's police in Hongkong in 1933 and German secret polices figured out Ho's identity. Because Germans didn't want to repeat the mass demonstration after Phan Boi Chau's execution in 1925, Ho was secretly executed in Hongkong.

#Manpower crisis
#The resistance and revolution should depend on the voluntary spirit of Indochinese people. That being said, the manpower crisis of our newly-born army is more and more severe. Introducing a draft will solve the problem, but it's worried that the new state apparatus doesn't have the ability to carry out conscription well...

#Enact conscription
#Mobilise urban population
#Focus on expanding village guerillas

#'Upgrade' system
#A new recruitment system called 'Upgrade' is being promoted all across Indochina. Under this system peasants are encouraged to be part-time and full-time militia or guerillas in their own village. After they have basic training and military experience, they will be encouraged to join regional forces, and later regular troops. Most recruits through this system are already adapted to military life when they join the regular army. This system will be able to offer a stable source of manpower for our army'
#This is how voluntary spirit works!


#Rising disertion rate
#Since the introduction of conscription, the army is suffering from demoralisation and high distion rate. Indochinese peasants in general are very reluctant to leave their homeland. In order to recruit more soldiers, the improvised recruitment committees have to used forceful methods. Many recruits are brought away from their home after a knock at the midnight. They complaint that they are very afraid being sent to remote places from their home with poor training and arms to fight the powerful enemy.
#We shouldn't push that hard!
#We need to enforce military discipline
