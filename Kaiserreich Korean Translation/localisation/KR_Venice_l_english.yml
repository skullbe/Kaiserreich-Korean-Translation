### Events ###
venice.1.t:0 "First Session of the Great Council"
venice.1.d:0 "For the first time in over a hundred years, the Great Council of Venice convenes once more. Members from across the republic gather in Venice to discuss how the Venetian Republic should be structured. Already two camps have emerged between those that want Venice to be a modern republic and those that want the Republic of Old to be re-established."
venice.1.a:0 "Let us begin"

venice.2.t:0 "Election and term of the Doge"
venice.2.d:0 "The first question to come up was the election of the Doge. In the old republic, it was elected for life by the great council by choosing 30 members by random lot, whom would be reduced to 9 by random lot, those 9 would name 40 members who had to be approved by 7 of the 9. The forty were reduced by lot to 12 who named 25 members, those 25 had to be approved by 9 of the 12. The 9 would name 45 and each member had to be approved by 7 of the 9. The 45 members were reduced by lot to 11. These 11 named 45 who had to be approved by 9 of the 11. these 45 were finally reduced by lot to 25 and they would choose the doge.\n\nNaturally the system is considered rather archaic. Those within the Great Council seeking to modernise the Republic, instead propose that the doge should be elected directly by the people and with a four-year term limit subject to re-election."
venice.2.a:0 "Directly elected and term-limited"
venice.2.b:0 "The Old Method and for Life"

venice.3.t:0 "Franchise of the Great Council"

While those arguing for a new modernised republic believe equal franchise for all Venetians shall be the law of the day."
venice.3.a:0 "Full Franchise"
venice.3.b:0 "Wealth Requirements."

venice.4.t:0 "State Inquisitors"
venice.4.d:0 "In the Old Republic, one of the ways that it remained so Serene was due to the efforts of the Council of Ten and the State Inquisitors.

venice.4.a:0 "We do not need them"
venice.4.b:0 "We shall restore them and the Council of Ten"

venice.9.t:0 "Venice asks for a plebiscite"
