rusd.3.t:0 "Failure of a Bombing Plot"
rusd.3.d:0 "The Anarchists, Socialists, Syndicalists and Bolsheviks are weakening the stability of our Motherland.

rusd.4.t:0 "Peasant Unrest"
rusd.4.d:0 "Throughout Russian history the peasants' living conditions has always been hard, even during periods of peace and prosperity. Even the emancipation reforms of 1861, which led to the abolition of serfdom, did not improve the situation all that much. Local peasant protests against their grim position, as well as landowners' illegal actions, were common."
rusd.4.a:0 "Oh well..."

rusd.5.t:0 "Agitation in the Countryside"
rusd.5.d:0 "With the situation in the countryside growing increasingly unstable the peasants became easy to influence by various agitators.

rusd.5.b:0 "Eliminate the agitator!"

rusd.6.t:0 "Major Peasant Unrest"
rusd.6.d:0 "Agitated by various groups, the impoverished peasantry has risen up.

rusd.7.a:0 "Oh well..."

rusd.8.t:0 "Workers' Strike"
rusd.8.d:0 "Some workers in one of our cities have organised themselves and began to strike, completely disrupting all industrial production within the city. They demand higher salaries and enforcement of labour regulations preventing unfair treatment of the workforce."

rusd.8.b:0 "Ignore their demands."
rusd.8.c:0 "Send in the army to pacify them!"

rusd.9.t:0 "Negotiating with the Strikers"
rusd.9.d:0 "An attempt to negotiate with the striking workers has been made. All political forces in the country closely watch the meeting, and some are hoping that the strike will become an impulse for further reforms in Russia."
rusd.9.a:0 "Stall the negotiations."
rusd.9.b:0 "Reach an agreement, but keep the reforms to a minimum."
rusd.9.c:0 "Reach a thorough agreement."

rusd.10.t:0 "Harsh Measures"
rusd.10.d:0 "The commander of a local army garrison has proposed that we use brute force in order to disperse the strikers and force them to go back to work."
rusd.10.a:0 "Why not? It's quicker than those negotiations!"
rusd.10.b:0 "No, we must not be too harsh."

rusd.11.t:0 "The Strikers give up!"
rusd.11.d:0 "The slow war of attrition between us and the strikers has been won by the government. The workers, seeing little success in their efforts, are about to call off the strike."

rusd.13.t:0 "General Strike"
rusd.13.d:0 "Workers organisations all over the Russia have reached an agreement and decided to call for a general strike.

rusd.40.t:0 "The Patriarch criticises our Government"
rusd.40.d:0 "Seeing increased displeasure among the common people, the patriarch has decided to voice his concern about the increasing secularisation of our state.

rusd.44.a:0 "A harmless, yet useful ceremony!"

rusd.45.d:0 "A small celebration dedicated to the prosperity of our Motherland has been performed yesterday in one of our towns.

rusd.45.a:0 "S nami Bog!"

rusd.46.d:0 "A large scale celebration has taken place is our capital. Apart from thousands of common Russians, the Patriarch, members of the Romanov family and dozens of nobles, politicians and high-ranking officers have attended the mass.

rusd.48.d:0 "It seems that the liberal elements of our society consider it rather unwise to maintain such strong bonds between the Church and the state. During a small demonstration in the capital, they have demanded more religious pluralism and secularisation of the government."
rusd.48.a:0 "Let them shout!"

rusd.50.t:0 "The Prime Minister Addresses the Duma"
rusd.50.d:0 "After Kerensky's assassination the country is still in chaos.

rusd.52.t:0 "The Patriarch's Demands"
rusd.52.d:0 "Prime Minister-Patriarch Kirill provoked a major crisis and has threatened to resign his position unless the Synod of the Russian Church be allowed to exercise veto power on all new legislation.

rusd.56.t:0 "The Tsar is dead!"
rusd.56.d:0 "His Royal Highness, Kirill Romanov, Tsar and Autocrat of All the Russias, has died less than two years after the Restoration! Thankfully, the line of succession is now clear; his young son Vladimir shall be crowned as the new Tsar."

rusd.59.t:0 "Kirill Romanov is dead"
rusd.59.d:0 "The Romanov pretender, Kirill Romanov, has died. His son Vladimir is in his early twenties and may make an excellent and pliable figurehead as Tsar. Perhaps now it is time to restore the Monarchy?"
rusd.59.a:0 "Yes, a new Tsar shall promote order and stability!"
rusd.59.b:0 "No. The Tsarist system shall never rise again."

rusd.60.a:0 "Yes, our people will enjoy a spectacular coronation!"

rusd.61.t:0 "The IX Duma Elections"
rusd.61.d:0 "According to the Constitution elections are to be held every five years. Although Kerensky's assassination caused major turmoil in Russia, the VIII Duma has managed to wait out the storm and elections should proceed without interruption. But who will triumph?"

rusd.61.b:0 "The SR-Menshevik Leftist Coalition."

rusd.62.e:0 "The army shall put an end to this chaotic democracy!"

rusd.65.t:0 "The Presidential Elections of 1937"
rusd.65.d:0 "According to our constitution a new President should be elected after Kerensky's assassination. However, political turmoil has caused a delay in the procedure and elections could proceed only after the IX Duma was chosen. Now the time has come to settle the one final dispute in our government. Who should the Senate choose to lead the country?"
rusd.65.a:0 "Viktor Chernov, leader of the SR Party."
rusd.65.b:0 "Vasily Maklakov, the Kadet-Liberal representative."
rusd.65.c:0 "Dmitri Pavlovich Romanov, an aristocratic candidate."
rusd.65.e:0 "Solomon Lozovsky! A modern people's tribune!"

rusd.66.t:0 "SR-Menshevik Coalition breaks up"
rusd.66.d:0 "Kerensky's death meant that the fragile SR-Kadet coalition was no more. Even though the SR-Menshevik coalition has resulted in the two parties gaining considerable influence in the government, ideological differences between the two parties were too great to maintain a coherent coalition, resulting in the Mensheviks leaving the government. This gives way to great possibilities, including a Menshevik-Bolshevik coalition in the near future."
rusd.66.a:0 "Let the Reds quarrel!"
rusd.66.b:0 "Oh no!"

rusd.67.t:0 "Splintering within the Conservatives"
rusd.67.d:0 "Dmitri Romanov's authority and charisma was one of the few things that kept the Russian conservatives strong and vibrant. With his death, the movement quickly split into two branches; the so-called Siloviki, organised around marshal Denikin and consisting mostly of White military officers, and the conservative Civilians, gathered around professor Nikolai Trubetskoy. Without his protector, Yusupov was quickly replaced by Trubetskoy."
rusd.67.a:0 "Let them quarrel!"

rusd.68.t:0 "The X Duma Elections"
rusd.68.d:0 "According to the Constitution elections are to be held every five years. The IX Duma's term has expired and the time has come to elect a new parliament. With the conservatives and left-wing forces in disarray, these elections may lead to surprising results."

rusd.71.b:0 "The Mensheviks."
rusd.71.c:0 "The Menshevik-Bolshevik Coalition."

rusd.76.d:0 "According to the Constitution elections are to be held every five years. The IX Duma's term has expired and the time has come to elect a new parliament. However, many orthodox Bolsheviks see the Duma as an unnecessary obstacle in building the Communist state. The right-wing sympathisers within the Army are also a problem."
rusd.76.a:0 "Dissolve the Duma and place loyal officers in the Army!"
rusd.76.b:0 "Compromise with the Mensheviks and SR."
rusd.76.c:0 "The Kadets, liberals, and royalists overthrow the Bolsheviks!"

rusd.78.t:0 "Tsardom restored"
rusd.78.d:0 "A combined front of Kadets, liberals, and monarchists has managed to topple the Bolshevik republic and restore the monarchy under Vladimir Romanov. What kind of monarchy should it be?"
rusd.78.a:0 "A constitutional monarchy."
rusd.78.b:0 "An autocratic monarchy."

rusd.90.b:0 "The Bolsheviks pull off a victory."
rusd.90.c:0 "Another faction prevails."

rusd.91.t:0 "Right wing victory"
rusd.91.d:0 "Rather surprisingly, a right-wing party has secured a victory in the elections. But which one?"
rusd.91.a:0 "A Kadet-Liberal coalition."

rusd.91.c:0 "Trubetskoy's conservatives."

rusd.95.t:0 "The Presidential Elections of 1949"

rusd.96.t:0 "Anton Denikin dies"
rusd.96.d:0 "A Hero of the Civil War and the informal leader of Russian conservatives, Anton Ivanovich Denikin, died yesterday in his manor. Although never as radical as his counterpart, Baron Wrangel, Denikin's influence throughout Russia was hard to overestimate. A week of national mourning has been declared as the people bade farewell to one of the few true Heroes of Russia. Grand Admiral Vasily Kanin has been selected to replace him as the head of the Siloviki."
rusd.96.a:0 "Goodbye, Denikin"
rusd.96.b:0 "Even the strongest die one day!"

rusd.961.t:0 "Anton Denikin's Succession"

rusd.97.a:0 "Memento mori."

rusd.98.t:0 "Pyotr Struve dies"
rusd.98.d:0 "A great liberal and a proponent of the democratic system in Russia, Pyotr B. Struve, has passed away. A member of the Kadet Party and a skilled politician before, during and after the Civil War, Struve shall be remembered as one of the greatest patriots in our history."

However, the young Tsarevich is only 12 so the Prime Minister would have to act as regent until Pavel II comes of age. This means that anti-monarchic elements in the government are likely to make an attempt to overthrow the monarchy and reestablish a republic. Besides, there is the legitimate pretender Vladimir waiting for his chance."

But it turned out that the new government has many loyalists in the others circles of the Russian society. Old friends of Savinkov, the famous philosopher Dmitry Merezhkovsky and his wife Zinaida Gippius have published an appeal to the new leaders of the country. They claimed that Russia must be purified from the internal enemies, who want to spread the chaos and to betray the national interests.

Because we don't forget about our brothers and sisters. The era of the betrayal is over. We are the Phoenix, that was destroyed by the German aggressors, but was reborn. Wait for us. We will come. The Russians should help the Russians' - Though the expansionist plans of Savinkov cannot be realise right now, but this declaration of the unity of the Russian Nation, strongly supported by the Vozhd of the Peasants and the Army shows, that Russia won't avoid the confrontation with the German Empire anymore."

New Russia needs your help in the restoration of its might. Help your country to make it great once again. Glory to Russia and glory to its heroes. It is your country too' - The new national policy of Russia is based on the idea of the supremacy of the Russians, but the idea of the friendship of the nations is popular as well. Savinkov combined these two ideas to secure the interests of the Russians and the minorities, who should be loyal, but also can use all the right of the citizens. This recreation of the old tsarist national policy can finally bring an order and peace to the people of Russia."

Facades of the pavilions of the Russian regions showed the strategic meeting of architectural traditions with the arts and crafts of each part of the country together with motives of important collective labour.

But it is obvious that the government can't allow the left radicals in the State Duma and the monarchists in the Senate use these controversies to destroy the rule of the army and NRPR. To prevent such unwanted events, Savinkov has proposed a recreation of the Supreme Privy Council, which once in the Russian history had had both executive and legislative power and had consisted of the small number of the most important Russian ministers. This SPC will include 3 party members with Savinkov on the top along with Kornilov and 3 his old comrades from the Russian Army.

The power of the Senate should be used as the iron fist in a velvet glove' - with these words the former Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich and now the Head of the Senate Dmitri Romanov demanded an approval of his plan, which is called 'Nashe Delo' ('Our Deal'). According to this program, the powers of the State Duma should be limited, while the Senate will launch the reorganisation of the Russian internal policy and economy.

With the opening of the new gymnasiums the old tradition was reborn and became very popular and attractive for the students all over the Russian cities and towns, where the Gymnasiums were founded.

Though these taxes are really profitable for our economy, but the loyalty of the Senators are highly important for the realisation of the Dmitri Pavlovich's policy. There is a possible solution of this problem - the mansions of some senators can be secured by the Republic as the historical heritage - it means that the Senators will pay the taxes, but the government will partially invest into the maintenance of these buildings."

The Grand Duke, who controls the country with an iron fist in a velvet glove, but also doesn't forget to analyse various propositions of the Senate became the real leader of the Russians and got many new allies even in the State Duma. That's why the Senate unanimously decided to give Dmitri Romanov the broad powers, which even the last tsar Nicholas II and president Kerensky didn't have.

The Grand Duke, who controls the country with an iron fist in a velvet glove, paid no attention to the ideas of this state authority. That's why the majority of the Senate decided to revoke the broad powers, which were given to the Duke one year ago.
