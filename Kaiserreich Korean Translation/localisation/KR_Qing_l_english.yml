qing.102.t:0 "The Qing are asking for everything"
qing.102.d:0 "The Qing are asking to deal for everything, even our lands! - we fought hard and won this land!"
qing.102.a:0 "Never!"
qing.102.b:0 "This insult is cause for war!"
qing.103.t:0 "Mongolia Refuses"
qing.103.d:0 "The Mongolian representative has refused to accept our deal. Such grave insult to our empire must not go unpunished!"

qing.104.t:0 "The Legation Cities"
qing.104.d:0 "The Legation Cities were the richest coastal cities of China and now they are under foreign control. With the southern provinces in our hands we should try to regain these lost territories as well. There is however a problem since the Treaty ports, as they're called, contain significant foreign investments and capital, and it may be unwise to antagonise all the major world powers."

qing.110.a:0 "Maybe it is the best for the Empire"
qing.110.b:0 "Everything or Nothing!"
qing.111.t:0 "No compromises"
qing.111.d:0 "The Qing answer is very simple and short. 'No.' It looks like that they don't want to make any concessions. That's bad news for us."

qing.112.t:0 "Legation Cities accept"
qing.112.d:0 "The leaders of the Legation Cities accepted our ultimatum to allow supervision of their government and promised to be more loyal to the Emperor in the future."

qing.113.t:0 "Legation Cities accept"

qing.113.a:0 "Perfect"
qing.114.t:0 "Fate of Tibet"
qing.114.d:0 "After seizing control over Yunnan province our officers have started to plan the invasion of Tibet. But members of our diplomatic corps argue that perhaps we could try to force them to surrender before we launch an outright invasion."

qing.115.t:0 "Qing deal"
qing.115.d:0 "The Qing ambassador approached us and gave us an ultimatum about joining the Qing Empire. He offered to bring us to the table with Emperor Pu Yi. We don't have much choice but maybe we can stay independent."

qing.116.a:0 "Perfect"
qing.117.t:0 "Tibet wants to be semi-independent"
qing.117.d:0 "Tibet has sent the answer. They are willing to submit before us but they wish to remain autonomous within our empire."
qing.117.a:0 "That's good enough for us."
qing.117.b:0 "Tibet belongs to the Empire!"
qing.118.t:0 "Tibetan ignorance"
qing.118.d:0 "Tibet ignored our rightful demands about reuniting our Empire. Military response is the only answer to this insult."
qing.118.a:0 "Emperor Pu-Yi won't stand this insult!"
qing.118.b:0 "Then just let them be and look for a new target"
qing.119.t:0 "Dealing with Mongolia"
qing.119.d:0 "After seizing control of our western provinces, only territory of Mongolia is not under our control. Although many moderate politicians argue that expansion aimed in this direction would bring nothing for our empire but further extend our still limited forces and force further hardship upon our population."
qing.119.a:0 "Nonsense, Mongolia will belong to China again!"
qing.119.b:0 "Moderates are right, expansion into Mongolia would be a mistake"
qing.120.t:0 "We are Losing the War!"

qing.132.t:0 "Fengtian"
qing.132.d:0 "We have mostly recreated our grand empire. Now just Manchuria remains outside our sphere of influence and with our growing might it should be possible to claim it for centralised Chinese government for the first time since 1926."
qing.132.a:0 "We must liberate our homeland!"
qing.132.b:0 "This is too dangerous."
qing.133.t:0 "Negotiations with Fengtian?"
qing.133.d:0 "The decision that Fengtian Republic will be our next target is really risky. Fengtian republic boasts itself with most powerful armed forces of all warlord states and any military encounter with it would be detrimental to our cause of united China. We should perhaps try to bring Fengtian back to our empire diplomatically?"
qing.133.a:0 "It's worth a try"
qing.133.b:0 "Impossible is impossible"
qing.134.t:0 "Negotiations with Qing?"
qing.134.d:0 "The Qing ambassador approached us and gave us an ultimatum about joining the Qing Empire, unless our state wants to face unspecified military and diplomatic response. Despite strength of our armed forces it might be for the best to negotiate with Qing Empire."

qing.138.t:0 "Negotiations"
qing.138.d:0 "Yesterday a Qing messenger arrived dressed as a woman 'nudge nudge'. He told us that Qing Empire is now ready to stretch its influence into Manchuria and wants us to align with a truly Chinese dynasty!"

qing.140.c:0 "Rally round the Great Qing! To war!"
qing.141.t:0 "The Fengtian Refused"
qing.141.d:0 "Our order was refused by General Zueling. He said that the time has not come to unite China under the rule of the Qing Dynasty."
qing.141.a:0 "We will attack anyway!"
qing.141.b:0 "Then we should wait for the right opportunity"
qing.142.t:0 "Preparations Complete"
qing.142.d:0 "Our preparations to attack the hated Fengtian are complete. To war!"
qing.142.a:0 "The time has come!"
qing.143.t:0 "Reuniting China - German territories"
qing.143.d:0 "After defeating Japan, maybe it's time to deal with the last enemy. Germany. We defeated Japan, and that means we are the strongest power in Asia. Now that we don't have any equal enemies we don't need the Kaiser's help anymore."
qing.143.a:0 "It's the time!"
qing.143.b:0 "That would be not nice from us"
qing.144.t:0 "The Qing are moving troops into our ports!"
qing.144.d:0 "Last night the Qing Empire moved troops across the border into our cities along the coast! They are claiming ownership and demanding that we back down before they invade Indochina!"

qing.144.b:0 "The Kaiser will not stand for this INSULT!"
qing.145.t:0 "Germany accepts"
qing.145.d:0 "Germany accepted our demands and gave back our rightful territories. It's an important step to reunite the Qing Empire under the rule of the glorious Qing dynasty."
qing.145.a:0 "Welcome home"
qing.146.t:0 "Status of Macau"
qing.146.d:0 "It's been hundreds of years since Macau became a Portuguese holding in 1557 by purchasing it from the Jiajing Emperor of the Ming dynasty. Now that the South lies in the hands of the Qing once more, the emperor is considering whether to claim the port of Macau from the Portuguese or to not interfere with the ownership of the city sold before the rise of the Qing."
qing.146.a:0 "It belongs to China!"
qing.146.b:0 "Let the idea slide"
qing.147.t:0 "Qing Demands"
qing.147.d:0 "After centuries, the Qing Emperor now decided to demand Macau from us. The Qing Empire is now one of the strongest states in the Far East and fighting them is probably not a good idea."
qing.147.a:0 "We have no choice."
qing.147.b:0 "They will have to fight for it!"
qing.148.t:0 "China reunited!"
qing.148.d:0 "We had to fight fiercely on the battlefields and in the conference rooms but we have reached our goal. The Qing Empire is now reunited and stronger than ever! The last hundred years was just a nightmare! Time for a big festival to celebrate becoming a Great Power!"

qing.150.t:0 "The War of Resistance"
qing.150.d:0 "The Qing Empire is now in a War of Resistance against our mortal enemies. We cannot hold for long on our own. We should ask for support and possibly to form a Coalition to combat foreign expansionism."

qing.151.t:0 "The Sino Coalition"
qing.151.d:0 "The Qing Empire is fighting a war against against the mortal enemies of China, and has asked that we join their so called 'Sino Coalition' in order to stop the foreigners from taking Mainland China. One thing they say is true, if the Qing fall, we may be next."
