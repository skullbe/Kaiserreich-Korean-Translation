The central activities of the day occur in the Imperial capital where, on the anniversary of his death, the remains of George V are reinterred in a special vault in an elaborate ceremony at Westminster Abbey, attended by Edward VIII, the royal family, and leading political and military figures. This fulfilled the late King's dying wish to return to Britain. After the ceremony, the King led a solemn procession to the east end of the Mall, where a monument to George V was unveiled. During the unveiling, the King stated that the monument commemorated all those who had been victims of the former Syndicalist regime, and that all had suffered, from the King to the lowest laborer. Never again, pledged the King, would Syndicalism threaten the liberties of Britons, which had been passed down through the ages. To honour the victims of Syndicalism, and keep fresh the memory of what had been so nearly lost and so dearly gained, henceforth every [GetDateText] was to be celebrated as Liberty Day."

Two plans have come up as to how to rebuild the city. The first plan was to restore it in all its original glory and splendour the city of London will be restored to look like it did in 1925 before the Revolution. The second plan is the famed architect Edwin Lutyens so called Imperial plan. Drawing on the ideas of Haussmann's renovation of Paris, the Plan calls for wide boulevards and a focus on imperial grandeur, with Lutyen's particular blend of Art deco and Classical hybrid style."

They are: squalor, ignorance, want, idleness, and disease. The report goes on to argue that we should implement a social welfare state to help the people. This has created furious debate within the government as some refuse out right to endorse the proposal out right with a number calling Beveridge a syndicalist. However some conservative MPs proposed their own bill which is watered down, but they argue such a bill will prevent people from falling into syndicalism again."

uk.21.d:0 "The Defeat of the Union of Britain brought with it the destruction of the old trade unions that had supported the Syndicalist regime. However, there is still the question of whether British workers should be allowed to organise on a local basis to defend their interests. Some argue that we should regulate them and keep an eye on them, while other say that they must be banned to prevent another event like the 1925 interregnum, a third group argues that we can co-op the Unions for our own purposes."

### Irish Policy ###
uk.51.t:0 "Policy towards Ireland"
uk.51.d:0 "As we look to rebuild the British Empire on question has emerged is Ireland. Following the Great War and then the 'Revolution of 1925' we had to give up control of Ireland. However now that we have resolved our issues, it is time to turn our attention to Ireland. Military and Political leaders agree that we need Ireland in our orbit and thus preventing Ireland from being a staging ground for the any hostile forces. However, they are divided as to how to handle this and three plans have come forth. The first plan calls for signing a treaty to bring them into our orbit in exchange for formally giving up our claims to the island. The second plan calls for Home Rule to be re-established, since before the Great War began that was about to be put into effect. This would allow them to keep their independence as long as they accept that King Edward and his descendent are their king. Finally we could just reconquer them."

While relations with the Syndicalists were often strained, there was great foreboding that a restored Royalist Britain might attempt to regain control over Ireland. With King Edward VIII back in London and the right in power, that is precisely what has occurred. An ultimatum has been delivered to the Irish government, requesting that the island submit itself once again to British rule. The response of Michael Collins can be easily imagined."

uk.52.b:0 "Erin Go Bragh!"

uk.53.t:0 "The Irish Government accepts our Demands"

Even now, elements of the British armed forces are landing in the major ports and establishing British control and disarming the small Irish forces, while the civil service is expanding to meet the requirements of administering a second island. This has been a signal diplomatic triumph for King Edward VIII and His Majesty's Government."
uk.53.a:0 "Rule Britannia!"

uk.54.t:0 "The Irish Government rejects our demands"
uk.54.d:0 "Foolishly, the Irish government has rejected the British request to restore British control over the island. The question now is whether to resort to the use of force to ensure that British rights are respected and enforced or to drop the matter."
