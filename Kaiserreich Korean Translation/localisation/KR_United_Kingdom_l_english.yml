UK_ban_prog:0 "Ban the Progressive Party?"
UK_ban_prog_desc:0 "While the three main political parties of the former exiles are preparing for the general election, a fourth party has been organising - the Progressive Party. It includes prominent intellectuals, including some who had remained in Britain during the Syndicalist interregnum. Some fear that letting the party contest the general election will open the door for Syndicalist sympathisers to regain power."
UK_noelection:0 "No Election"
UK_noelection_desc:0 "Cancel the elections, and make the Military Provisional Government permanent!"
UK_election:0 "The General Election"
UK_election_desc:0 "Continue the preparations for the elections."
UK_aristocracy:0 "The Return of the Aristocracy"
UK_aristocracy_desc:0 "With the triumph of the Royalists, the aristocracy has returned to Britain, only to find that their former lands had been expropriated by the Syndicalists and redistributed to peasants and farmers. These aristocrats naturally wish to have their land returned to them."
UK_liberty_day:0 "Liberty Day"
UK_liberty_day_desc:0 "The defeat of Syndicalism is worthy of a National Holiday. This will remind the workers of their place."
UK_suspend:0 "Suspend Habeas Corpus"
UK_suspend_desc:0 "One of the first tasks of the Provisional Government is destroying any remaining vestiges of Syndicalism in British society. To this end, some have suggested the suspension of Habias Corpus and other civil liberties, in order that justice may be done swiftly and thoroughly."
UK_mi5:0 "The Forever Eyes Program"
UK_mi5_desc:0 "The MI 5, our domestic intelligence service, has repeatedly asked for and received increases in funding. Their newest pledge for funding was justified with an expansive and expensive wiretapping project dealing with possible Syndicalist sympathisers - the Forever Eyes Program. Funding the Program would allow us to more efficiently control the public opinion."

UK_art_academy:0 "The Academy of Arts"
UK_art_academy_desc:0 "The Royal Academy of Arts has returned to Burlington House on Piccadilly. However, they could use our patronage to fill their halls since most of the art that originated during the Syndicalist interregnum has been deemed... obstructive. With a little funding, we should be able to convince some of the leading artists to return home."
UK_art_overcome:0 "Avantgarde"
UK_art_overcome_desc:0 "Funding some of the more Avantgarde artists of our country would promote public discourse over the Legacy of Syndicalism. While, in the short term, some criticism of our anti-Syndicalist policies could arise, in the long term this would lead to more Unity."
UK_art_propaganda:0 "Loyalists"
UK_art_propaganda_desc:0 "By continuing the funding of the Loyalist artists of our country, we can assure that no citizen will let their guard down against the menace of Syndicalism. Some may, however, find confirmation for their suspicions of an authoritarian bias in the media."
UK_art_2:0 "Righteous Cause"
UK_art_2_desc:0 "It doesn't matter who we support - they're all convinced they're right. If we spread this conviction through our armed forces, their performance will increase notably."
UK_art_3:0 "Citizens under Arms"
UK_art_3_desc:0 "The soldier is not simply a tool for the generals to throw at the enemy - instead, he is a Citizen under Arms, with all duties and rights. By establishing this idea in law and in training, we can enhance combat inventiveness."
UK_art_4:0 "Agitprop"
UK_art_4_desc:0 "While their revolution failed, the Leninists and Trotskyists of Russia correctly saw the importance of Propaganda behind the own front. By establishing Propaganda units to accompany each regular combat unit, we can further enhance combat performance."

UK_reintegrate_emigres_desc:0 "Most of the members of the society of the United Kingdom left for Canada in 1926 - Industrialists, artists, scientists, soldiers. Some have already returned, others will need convincing. We need their help, but at the same time, they were isolated from what has become British society by now - conflict is unavoidable."

UK_loans_desc:0 "Loans to the returned Industrialists will ensure a quick growth of the Civilian industry."
UK_ban_unions:0 "Ban Trade Unions"
UK_ban_unions_desc:0 "The Defeat of the Union of Britain brought with it the destruction of the old trade unions that had supported the Syndicalist regime. However, there is still the question of whether British workers should be allowed to organise on a local basis to defend their interests. The Industrialists are pushing towards a total ban, which will enrage the workers."
UK_compromise:0 "Allow Trade Unions"
UK_compromise_desc:0 "The Defeat of the Union of Britain brought with it the destruction of the old trade unions that had supported the Syndicalist regime. However, there is still the question of whether British workers should be allowed to organise on a local basis to defend their interests.

UK_social_market:0 "Social Market"
UK_social_market_desc:0 "The state has the duty to guarantee the welfare of all workers. By working closely together with the newly-established Trade Unions, we can ensure that the events of 1926 will not repeat."
UK_royal_academy:0 "The Royal Society"
UK_royal_academy_desc:0 "The President, Council and Fellows of the Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge have returned to London. Well, some of the fellows. Most are still in Canada, but with a little encouragement, we should be able to get them to return."
UK_royal_academy_2:0 "The Grapes of Tech Sharing"
UK_royal_academy_2_desc:0 "For a few years, the scientific community in the nations of the former Empire have closely collaborated. Now would seem to be the time to reap the political fruits of these years."
UK_royal_academy_4:0 "Elizabeth Program"
UK_royal_academy_4_desc:0 "The various research activities of our scientists are, by now, continuing on as before. Some advisers have proposed a Program, the Elizabeth Program, to stimulate small research teams. The name was proposed by the King himself - normally such a Program would maybe be named after a Crown Prince or Princess, but the King would not budge for some reason."
UK_sponsored_research:0 "Sponsored Research"
UK_sponsored_research_desc:0 "By promoting investments into research companies, we can assure that British industry does not fall behind the rest of the world."
UK_synthetics_research:0 "Synthetics Research"
UK_synthetics_research_desc:0 "The Kingdom, before the revolution of 1926, was largely dependent on resource imports from the colonies. While the Syndicalists made some advancements in terms of artificial production, our Synthetic industry still has a lot to do."
UK_computer_research:0 "Electronic Research"
UK_computer_research_desc:0 "Another area in which the Syndicalists made some advancements - general Electronics. But still, there are advancements left to be made! For Science!"
UK_jet_research:0 "The Gloster Star"
UK_jet_research_desc:0 "The Gloster Aircraft Company has requested government funding and support for a research project concerning a new sort of aircraft propulsion method. Their project, called the 'Gloster Star', could have incredible military potential."
UK_nuke_research:0 "Nuclear Research"
UK_nuke_research_desc:0 "The potentially devastating power of the Atom is already well known. Now that organised research into more esoteric areas is already well established, we can finally pull off the manpower effort necessary to make our own incursions into this matter."
UK_merchant_marine:0 "The Merchant Marine"
UK_merchant_marine_desc:0 "When the Royal Family fled Britain during the General Strike, a large portion of the British merchant marine followed them into exile. With the liberation of Britain, most of these ships have returned to Britain. Given the extraordinary efforts showed by Canada in the reconquest of Great Britain, this will most likely enrage the government in Ottawa."

uk.2.d:0 "Yesterday, the king opened the House of commons according to the ancient customs. The provisional government has been sworn in to defend the Monarchy and our grasp on the island is holding firm. However, the traces of Syndicalism still linger. Ensuring the democratic legitimacy of democracy will be a daunting task."
uk.2.a:0 "Splendid!"

### Economy & Technology ###
uk.3.t:0 "The Post-Syndicalist Economy"
uk.3.d:0 "Many emigré industrialists have decided to return home by now. This has thrown up the question of how we should deal with the socialisation of many British industries during the Syndicalist regime. Meanwhile, Canadian technical expertise is already flowing into the country, and the latest technological advancements are being discussed in the new Royal Academy."
uk.3.a:0 "To a more free market!"

### Military ###
uk.4.t:0 "Loyal army elements"
uk.4.d:0 "In a widely celebrated occasion, members of the old Royal Guard have come together in London to found the core of a new British military. However, there is a small problem: This "British Army" half consists of officers. Even with the material help from Canada and the allies, we will need a lot of time and effort to make our military respectable again."
uk.4.a:0 "This is just the beginning!"

### Disloyal Army Elements ###
uk.5.t:0 "Refugees from the Union of Britain"
uk.5.d:0 "The Royalists have somehow managed to defeat the Union of Britain. As a result, persecuted Syndicalists have fled across the Channel, seeking refuge on our shores. In addition, small elements of the former armed forces of the Union of Britain have reached the safety of our country, pledged to one day return to Britain and once again defeat the Royalists.""
uk.5.a:0 "Welcome to our Brothers in Syndicalism!"

### The Second Glorious Revolution ###
uk.6.t:0 "The Second Glorious Revolution"
uk.6.d:0 "Once again, the British people decided to overthrow a tyrannical regime and invite their righteous monarch back to reign over them. This time, they just needed a little more convincing. The new order is firmly established by now. The Syndicalist experiment in Britain is over."
uk.6.a:0 "Horrible!"
uk.6.b:0 "Glorious!"

### The First General Election ###
uk.7.t:0 "The First General Election"
uk.7.d:0 "After several months of preparations, the provisional government has completed arrangements for the first free election in Great Britain since the liberation.

uk.9.t:0 "Liberty Day"
uk.9.d:0 "Across Britain, stores and factories are closed, as Britons gather in a national day of remembrance, in honour of those who lost their lives in the struggle against Syndicalism. The central activities of the day occur in the Imperial capital where, on the anniversary of his death, the remains of George V are reinterred in a special vault in an elaborate ceremony at Westminster Abbey, attended by Edward VII, the royal family, and leading political and military figures. This fulfilled the late King's dying wish to return to Britain. After the ceremony, the King led a solemn procession to the east end of the Mall, where a monument to George V was unveiled. During the unveiling, the King stated that the monument commemorated all those who had been victims of the former Syndicalist regime, and that all had suffered, from the King to the lowest laborer. Never again, pledged the King, would Syndicalism threaten the liberties of Englishmen, which had been passed down through the ages. To honour the victims of Syndicalism, and keep fresh the memory of what had been so nearly lost and so dearly gained, henceforth every January 20th was to be celebrated as Liberty Day."

The central activities of the day occur in the Imperial capital where, attended by Edward VII, the royal family, and leading political and military figures, the Royal Guard parades through the city. Never again, the King then pledged in speech in front of the Masses assembled on the Mall, would Syndicalism threaten the liberties of Englishmen, which had been passed down through the ages. To honour the victims of Syndicalism, and keep fresh the memory of what had been so nearly lost and so dearly gained, this January 20th was celebrated as Liberty Day."

uk.11.d:0 "Crowds have formed on the Bristol dock where some of the most famous artists of the British exile are returning to their home country.

uk.12.a:0 "To the markets!"

### The Return of the Scientists ###
uk.13.t:0 "The Return of the Scientists"
uk.13.d:0 "Even at four o'clock in the morning, the laboratories and academies of Britain are now lit up again. Oxford and Eton have taken in their first classes since the revolution, and the clamoring for financing has begun anew. The Scientists of Britain have returned home."
