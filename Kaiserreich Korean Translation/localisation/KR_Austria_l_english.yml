AUS_eco_council:0 "Economic Rehabilitation Plan"
AUS_eco_council_desc:0 "Established in 1935 during conference to discuss the sluggish state of the Austrian industry, the Economic Rehabilitation Plan had be be put on halt due to the ongoing economic crisis. Still, its contents, with slight alterations, describe a good way to combat the disastrous effects of the Black Monday crash and to strengthen Austrian industry, now bereft of their main competitor."

AUS_skoda:0 "Škoda"
AUS_skoda_desc:0 "During the Weltkrieg, the Škoda Works to the west of Prague was our biggest arms producer, but has fallen on hard times with the overbearing power of German industries. With Germany rocked to the core by Black Monday, subsidies for Škoda is a large step in repairing our economy."

AUS_daimler:0 "Austro Daimler"
AUS_daimler_desc:0 "The Austro Daimler company made us many armoured vehicles and engines for our war effort.

AUS_vienna_circle_1:0 "Institutionalise the Vienna Circle"
AUS_vienna_circle_1_desc:0 "The Vienna Circle is a gathering of the brightest minds of the University of Vienna, brilliant mathematicians, philosophers, natural scientists who are at the forefront of scientific and philosophic research. We will make government funds available to them, but also move their work to new, more practical fields."

AUS_vienna_circle_2_desc:0 "With the Vienna Circle being well-established, funded, and gaining international recognition, the next step is to invite foreign countries with ties to the crown to take part in the research conducted there."

AUS_suedbahn:0 "Electrifying the Südbahn"
AUS_suedbahn_desc:0 "The Südbahn, or Southern Railway, is a railroad that runs from Vienna over Graz to Laibach and Triest, the main seaport of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, and finally Milano. Though still a major line of transportation, it was built from 1836 to 1860, so the tracks are in dire need of modernisation. Electrifying the connection would go over relatively swiftly, and help a lot with that."

AUS_homeland_eco:0 "Austrian Civilian Economy"
AUS_homeland_eco_desc:0 "Our already weak economy was reduced to tatters by the Black Monday crash, and the shock can be felt strongly in and around Vienna, but especially in the heavily industrialised Bohemia. Despite our neighbours suffering a similar fate, they already start recovering and outproducing us, so we must enhance our own economy through subsides for key automotive and electrical companies in order to better compete."

AUS_alpine_mines:0 "Alpine Mines"
AUS_alpine_mines_desc:0 "The Alps have always been a rich mineral resource, but until now we had no idea true extend of the wealth we have been sitting on. Huge amounts of iron ore are being taken from our previous mines and new mines are springing up daily. Subsidising or partially nationalising these industries would greatly increase our economic independence."

AUS_homeland_mil:0 "Austrian Military Economy"
AUS_homeland_mil_desc:0 "The Austrian Army has always suffered from mismanagement and poor equipment, but in this day and age that is something we can no longer accept. Threats from Hungarian 'liberalists' and the nearby syndicalist nations that have vowed for our destruction are growing daily, so we must properly arm our brave soldiers in order to survive."

AUS_airbase_expansion:0 "Expand the Austrian Airbases"
AUS_airbase_expansion_desc:0 "The new technology of longer range monoplanes gives us great opportunities, both military and economic. If used as bases for the Luftfahrtruppen, it will allow us to gain aerial superiority over the Italian frontier and threaten them without losing thousands of men. It can also be used to flying in new products and stimulate local economies."

AUS_istria_ports:0 "Ports of Istria"
AUS_istria_ports_desc:0 "Triest and Pflaum are our two principal naval bases, and are vitally important for our overseas trade. The navy, traditionally ignored by successive emperors, has begged us to increase the spending on industrial works and naval bases in Istria, and, swayed by their arguments about increased trade revenue, this emperor has listened."

AUS_farms_expand:0 "Expand Domestic Farms"
AUS_farms_expand_desc:0 "The fertile plains of Hungary and Lower Austria are covered in fields and farms, growing food to feed our empire. But these regions, particularly Hungary, suffer from less industrial investment and mechanisation. Starting a large scale effort to improve the farming techniques will cost us, but we will be rewarded with young, fit men ready for service."

### Elections of 1936
AUS_elections:0 "General Elections of 1936"
AUS_elections_desc:0 "Elections were held every six years in the Austrian part of the Dual Monarchy, though since the end of the Weltkrieg, several of these acting periods have been cut short by reform or scandals. \nAustrian politics are dominated by the SDAP, the Social-Democrat Worker's Party, and the CS, the Christian-Socials. Both have different ideas on how to solve the ongoing crisis, but who will win?"

AUS_sdap_industrial_workers_council:0 "Public Welfare Reforms"
AUS_sdap_industrial_workers_council_desc:0 "The main concern of the SDAP during the election campaign was to see that the Austrian worker lives through the ongoing crisis. They plan to reaffirm the many reforms introduced in conjunction with the CS since the Weltkrieg, and to provide pension for all those who have lost their jobs."

AUS_sdap_1:0 "Schools, Hospitals, and Parks"
AUS_sdap_1_desc:0 "Building new things is a great way to create short-term jobs. What is more, the things being built might end up providing even more jobs, and if it's schools, hospitals and parks, they are for the common good anyways, so apart from government money, there's nothing to lose."

AUS_sdap_2:0 "Naturfreunde"
AUS_sdap_2_desc:0 "Socialist tendencies were always something mostly harboured by city folk - and these city folk have since the dawn of the century found a new pastime: hiking. Many Viennese, many of them partymen, have come to enjoy climbing Austria's innumerable mountains in groups. Bringing hiking clubs to the countryside might help with bringing socialist sympathies to traditionally conservative areas."

AUS_sdap_3:0 "National Broadcasts"
AUS_sdap_3_desc:0 "Delivering concise and neutral news to the many remote regions of Austria has always been a bit of a problem, especially since the local newspapers have always had a certain political view inherent to them despite claiming otherwise. However, the radio might prove a solution to the problem - investing in the new machines might just bring Austria closer together."

AUS_sdap_4:0 "Work for the Work-less"
AUS_sdap_4_desc:0 "Those who have lost their jobs with the ongoing crisis have already been granted pensions to hold them over the water. However, they still want work - since we already pay them anyways, we might as well employ them. Factories that have previously been shut down by their owners are now starting to sluggishly operate again, led by state-controlled councils."

AUS_sdap_5:0 "Initial Recovery"
AUS_sdap_5_desc:0 "The re-opening of some key industries has set the hare running again. While not quite turning a profit yet, we are producing what the people need again, and that is just what an economy needs to run smoothly. We're slowly opening up more industries, but only time will tell whether continuing to do so will lead to a full recovery."

AUS_sdap_6:0 "Past the Bottleneck"
AUS_sdap_6_desc:0 "After some initial recovery, the status of our economy has stalled for a while. However, it seems like it is finally taking a turn for the better, private industries are starting to follow the public lead and broaden production to keep up with their state-sponsored counterparts."

AUS_sdap_7:0 "A Recovering Industry"
AUS_sdap_7_desc:0 "The crisis is fading away, and in contrast to it, it seems like the Red Vienna policies have led to an age of prosperity. May the French and British say what they want, Social Democratism works for us."


AUS_cs_national_austerity_council:0 "National Austerity Council"
AUS_cs_national_austerity_council_desc:0 "The most important thing we need to remember when dealing with the ongoing economic crisis is that we must not let it accrue to already existing national debt. Austria's coffers need to be full, not empty, in the following years, and there is only one way to achieve this: Cutting spending drastically."

### Military Tree

AUS_military_expansion:0 "Expand the Austrian Military"
AUS_military_expansion_desc:0 "Since the unification of Germany, the military has never truly been a priority for the Habsburgs, at least not to the extent of Germany or France or Russia. But now, with new threats both within and without, we simply cannot afford to sit idle. The Emperor has announced large scale funding increases to all of the three services, with more to come in the future."

AUS_military_inf:0 "Modernise the k.k. Infantry"
AUS_military_inf_desc:0 "Since time immemorial, the infantryman has been the most basic piece of the machinery of warfare. This simple truth is not likely to change anytime soon, and with the world slowing descending into chaos it is vital to strengthen that infantryman, who is all that stands between his country and chaos."

AUS_military_tank:0 "Create the k.k. Panzertruppen"
AUS_military_tank_desc:0 "Previously, Panzers have been used in the army on an ad hoc basis, held in reserve to assist infantry advances and to fight enemy panzer units. Now, new ideas are permeating into the heads of the General Staff: ideas of war of mobility, panzers leading attacks and cutting through enemy lines. The establishment of an independent panzer corps is the first step to making these ideas reality."

AUS_military_mountaineers:0 "Reinforce the k.k. Gebirgstruppe"
AUS_military_mountaineers_desc:0 "The mountaineers of the Gebirgstruppe form a barrier more potent than any Alp. These brave men have stood against Italian incursions time and time again, and with a little help from the government, they shall do so again."

AUS_aviation_effort:0 "Reinforce the K.u.K. Luftfahrtruppen"
AUS_aviation_effort_desc:0 "During the Weltkreig, the small Austria air force acted almost as a branch of the German Luftstreitskräfte. Our pilots and planes have been even less of a priority than our navy, leaving it in a terrible state and virtually useless against any real power that might threaten us. It is imperative this situation change and the Luftfahrtruppen are reformed."

AUS_fighter_focus:0 "Fighter Focus"
AUS_fighter_focus_desc:0 "The Staff of the Luftfahrtruppen have decided to focus on the integration and development of new monoplane designs, all metal and low winged beasts that will tear enemy planes from the sky and allow us total superiority over enemy lines."

AUS_bomber_focus:0 "Bomber Focus"
AUS_bomber_focus_desc:0 "The Staff of the Luftfahrtruppen have decided to expand and reinforce our bomber wing, enhancing our ability to attack the enemy in their forts and cities, far beyond our lines. Brand new all metal and large payload bombers controlling the battlefield is the way war shall be fought in the modern era."

AUS_phoenix:0 "Phönix"
AUS_phoenix_desc:0 "During the Weltkrieg, a small company in Vienna, bearing the name Phönix company has supplied our air force by producing licensed German planes for our market. Since then, the company has experimented with various designs, some of which might be the key to modernising the Luftfahrtruppen."

AUS_mil_expanded:0 "The New K.u.K. Armee"
AUS_mil_expanded_desc:0 "The reform of our army has been a long and expensive process, but it has finally paid off. New tanks, guns, ships and planes are rolling off the assembly lines and into our waiting armies, reformed and ready for battle with the enemies of the Empire!"

AUS_naval_effort:0 "Reinforce the K.u.K. Kriegsmarine"
AUS_naval_effort_desc:0 "The K.u.K. Kriegsmarine has always been underfunded and unappreciated by the Austrian government and her people. Without a colonial empire the navy never had any real backing or strategic purpose. However, this is a dangerous mentality, and with new syndicalist threats in the Mediterranean, whole new Kriegsmarine is vital to protect our heartlands."

AUS_flexible_navy:0 "Flexible Warfare"
AUS_flexible_navy_desc:0 "Our naval staff have decided to pursue a doctrine surrounding U-boats and convoy raiding, in order to be able to afflict as much damage as possible without having to face the overwhelming power of the French and British navies. Our unterseeboots will strike the enemy where it hurts most, in the economy."

AUS_large_navy:0 "Large Navy Plan"
AUS_large_navy_desc:0 "In line with traditional doctrine, the Kriegsmarine staff have decided to support the larger surface fleet we currently possess. Centred around larger and larger battleships and increasing our firepower through larger naval guns, these ideas will help us project our power and support land operations."

AUS_capital_ships_effort:0 "Austrian Capital Ship Plan"
AUS_capital_ships_effort_desc:0 "The staff have begun a concerted effort to improve upon our battleship designs, bringing more firepower to our battles. Increasing the size of the guns and the armoured belt allows our battleships to take far more of a beating leading attacks and deal far more damage in them as well."

AUS_small_ships_effort:0 "Austrian Small Ship Plan"
AUS_small_ships_effort_desc:0 "It has been decided that we need new models for destroyers and light cruisers, to combat enemy submarines and establish a surface presence. While our submarines are all well and good, larger ships are need to support land operations and do the tasks submarines do not have the firepower to complete."

AUS_military_occupation:0 "Military Occupation"
AUS_military_occupation_desc:0 "Hungary is subdued, and with it, the Austrian Empire shall be united once more. \nKeep in mind that not every of your subject might be happy with being ruled directly from Vienna."

AUS_status_quo:0 "Status Quo"
AUS_status_quo_desc:0 "Just like a decade prior, our negotiations for an administratively united Empire fell flat. We cannot do more than bide our time while trying to bind Transleithania closer by reform."

AUS_bayer:0 "Bayer Österreich"

AUS_all_austrian_development_scheme:0 "The All-Austrian Development Scheme"
AUS_all_austrian_development_scheme_desc:0 "Although nominally the Empire has been reunited under one central government, the reality is a vastly different story. The old realms need time and effort to be integrated with the imperial administration, and for the myriad peoples of the Empire to accept our rule."

AUS_italy:0 "The Italian Question"
AUS_italy_desc:0 "Since its founding, Italy has been an issue to successive Emperors. When divided, it became an easy road to Vienna for France, and when united it became a hostile power in its own right. With Italy beaten back for now, debates have been flying about the foreign ministry as to what our action towards her shall be."

AUS_italy_peaceful:0 "Italian Bonds"
AUS_italy_peaceful_desc:0 "The Tuscan branch of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine has been well integrated into Italian culture and now, the political scene. The installation of one of their number as the new King of Italy has opened avenues to us for friendlier relations with the country, as a possible buffer against French ambitions in the Mediterranean."

AUS_italy_military:0 "Conquer Italy"
AUS_italy_military_desc:0 "The Italians, driven by years of nationalism and now the new movement of syndicalism, will never accept our primacy diplomatically. The only way to secure the peninsula from French threat is through military occupation, and remind the Italians that this Austria is not the same as in the Weltkrieg."

AUS_unify_italy:0 "Unify the Italian Lands"
AUS_unify_italy_desc:0 "The rising of the Italian syndicalists in Naples split the country in two, with the French backed Socialist Republic of Italy in the south, and the Papist Italian Federation in the north. With Germany and France openly hostile to each other, helping our Catholic brothers will not only endear us to them, but secure our flank for a war with France."

AUS_strong_italy:0 "Strengthen the Italian Empire"
AUS_strong_italy_desc:0 "Italy, politically divided and still suffering the lingering effects of Black Monday, has requested the infusion of Austrian capital to its civilian sector. Economists both Italian and Austrian claim that this will help both sides and allow the weaker Italy to go toe to toe with the French in the Alps, something that is vital to our defence."

AUS_italy_secure:0 "Secure the Italian Lands"
AUS_italy_secure_desc:0 "Our new subjects, strangely, have not taken kindly to our occupation of their lands. Information coming from our secret police in the region is increasingly mentioning the possibility of a rebellion among the intelligentsia, both Papist and syndicalist. The Imperial Gendarmerie has suggested a crackdown on dissent and a propaganda campaign to secure the peninsula."

AUS_italy_exploit:0 "Exploit Italy"
AUS_italy_exploit_desc:0 "During our invasion, much of the state industry of Italy was either destroyed or was bought out as private, to hide it from our government. A new review by the Reichswirtschafsministeriat has found large portions of Italian industry that has hidden from us, and has suggested seizures by the police and the military to put them to good, Austrian use."

AUS_transcarpathian_railway:0 "The Transcarpathian Railway"
AUS_transcarpathian_railway_desc:0 "Reaching the far ends of the Empire had been hard to do for the past two decades, with Hungary refusing to let us modernise their railway network. Now that we are in control again, let us implement an old plan - a high velocity railway straight across the Carpathian Basin."

AUS_bohemian_lands:0 "Expand the Bohemian Infrastructure"
AUS_bohemian_lands_desc:0 "As the main border region between us and Germany it is vital that roads and rail systems remain well maintained and large enough to transport our army should a conflict break out. After the short but very mechanised war, Bohemia’s roads are everything but well mainta, not helped by the fighting in the region from Czech rebels."

AUS_bohemian_resources:0 "Expand the Prag Ironworks"
AUS_bohemian_resources_desc:0 "With Prag now under the control of the new central government, it has become evident that the steel production of the city has fallen far from what should be. A new plan to subsidise the Prag Ironworks has been floated by the Kaiserrat, and it seems to have caught the attention of the Kaiser and the imperial administration."

AUS_hungarian_lands:0 "Rebuild the Hungarian Industry"
AUS_hungarian_lands_desc:0 "While mainly a rural country, Hungary did have large civilian industries towards the west, where, unfortunately, the majority of the fighting took place. Budapest, partially destroyed from the war, shall become the centrepiece of an effort by the imperial government to return the war-torn area to its former glory."

AUS_extend_hungarian_airbases:0 "Claim the Hungarian Skies"
AUS_extend_hungarian_airbases_desc:0 "Hungary is a vast country, and it is difficult to respond quickly to any new threat, especially from Romania and the Balkans. The construction of new airfields across the country will remedy this problem, as well as supporting local economies and the rebuilding effort across the country."

AUS_cro_bosnian_lands:0 "Expand Bosnian and Croat Industry"
AUS_cro_bosnian_lands_desc:0 "While not as damaged by warfare as Hungary, Bosnia and Croatia still suffered damage, which is being exacerbated by ethnic terrorism and dissent. However, as an important region for our navy and for civilian trade, the creation of new industries in this area would do far more for our economy than can be ignored."

AUS_adria_sea_ports:0 "Buildup Adriatic Ports"
AUS_adria_sea_ports_desc:0 "With new industry in place, it is time to increase our shipbuilding capacities and our capability to facilitate trade vital to our industries. These brand new shipyards will support our navy and merchant marine, ensuring our primary in the Adriatic over any potential Italian usurpers."

AUS_claim_serbia:0 "Reclaim Serbia"
AUS_claim_serbia_desc:0 "Serbia has long been a thorn in our side, from raids into Hungary during the period of Ottoman dominance to the death of Franz Ferdinand and the attacks on Bosnia. Such a belligerent nation cannot be allowed to sit on our border unchallenged, defying the authority of the Emperor solely by its own existence."

AUS_claim_romanian_lands:0 "Claim Romanian Lands"
AUS_claim_romanian_lands_desc:0 "The Romanian regime under Corneliu Codreanu claimed large parts of Transylvania and our easternmost provinces, on the grounds of large ethnic Romanian communities in the area. However, the current political instability renders the Romanian army far less effective than it could be, so now is the time to claim all Romania and Romanians for the Emperor!"

AUS_claim_silesia:0 "Reclaim Silesia"

austria.1.t:0 "The Situation of Austria in 1936"
austria.1.d:0 "Despite standing amongst the victors of the Weltkrieg, the war revealed the divisions of culture, class and ideology within the Empire ever so clearly, and the inner unrest continued on as the war ended. \n\nKaiser Karl, following in the footsteps of the the assassinated Franz Ferdinand in trying to reform the multinational Austro-Hungarian Empire into something that could survive in the twentieth century, launched a series of large scale reforms; however, his efforts were largely blocked by nobility of the Hungarian side of the Empire - leading to his plans of federalisation progressing only slowly, and only on the Cisleithanian side of the Empire. \n\nHowever, many feel that there is hope for Austria - the last decades were hard on the Empire, but the effort has started paying off. Cisleithanian Austria, now a federation-state, has calmed down - but the same cannot be said for Transleithania. It is, however, unlikely that the Carpathian basin will continue to remain in Magyar hands, since Hungary's peoples have been gazing upon the liberties across the Leitha, wishing to have such autonomy for themselves. Whether reform will be able to find its way to Hungary, only the Kaiser knows for sure."
austria.1.a:0 "Austria erit in orbe ultima."

aus.elections.1.t:0 "Austrian Elections of 1936"
aus.elections.1.d:0 "Since federalisation begun, and the "Austrian elections" were mostly reduced to the German-speaking part of the Empire, two major parties have dominated Austrian politics: the CS and the SDAP. \n\nThis years' elections, too, are harshly fought; the SDAP and CS have very different ideas of dealing with the ongoing economic crisis. The SDAP's programme focuses on easing the worker's plight, with a focus on unemployment benefits and government intervention. The CS, on the other hand, follow a programme of severe austerity measurements."
aus.elections.1.a:0 "It is for the people to decide."

aus.elections.2.t:0 "Opening of School & SDAP Rally"
aus.elections.2.d:0 "Even if the economic situation of Austria has been dire for a while, the first years after the Weltkrieg, when the CS and SDAP still cooperated in their governance, saw widespread reforms in education and welfare. Academies for specialised workers begun construction, Workers' pensions were introduced, and child labour was once and for all eliminated. Vienna has been regarded as a front-runner in socialist circles. \n\nToday, a new academy is opened in the ninth district of Vienna, which the SDAP sees as a major success of theirs. Many speeches by various politicians are held, Karl Renner always standing in the background. \n\nRenner has been the effective head of the party since he found the goodwill of the Emperor during the Weltkrieg with a policy of Burgfrieden and cooperation with the Crown."

austria.8.t:0 "Syndicalism in Austria"
austria.8.d:0 "Terrible news. Following the defeat in the Austro-Hungarian Civil War, the Austrian public is growing disillusioned with emperor Otto and current state of the Austrian Empire. This has been used by the wretched syndicalists, who were able to gain support of the public and parts of the armed forces, and with their help have overthrown the existing government. Such a development must not be allowed to continue, since even the existence of a syndicalist Austria seriously undermines the integrity of our western border. We can either send an ultimatum to the new syndicalist government to reform itself to our liking, and allow our military to occupy the Austrian capital, or we can declare war upon them immediately and end the threat now.

### THE AUSGLEICH OF 1937 ###
#############################

ausgleich.new.100.t:0 "Ausgleich Preparations"
ausgleich.new.100.d:0 "Every ten years since 1867, Austrian and Hungarian delegations meet to discuss how much each side of the Empire puts into the Common ministries: the ministries for foreign, military and financial affairs. \n\nHowever, due to their loss and demand for reparations for the Croatian territories, the re-negotiations of 1927 came to a standstill, resulting in Hungary not having paid anything into the common treasury for the last decade. \n\nHungary's state as a renegade Crown under the Kaiser's reign has been a thorn in Austria's side for a while now, and at least some efforts have to be made to bring them back to the herd."
ausgleich.new.100.a:0 "Invite them formally."

ausgleich.new.101.t:0 "An Invitation to the Ausgleich"
ausgleich.new.101.d:0 "The Viennese government has invited us to re-negotiate the Ausgleich. While this happens every ten years since 1867, when Hungary was put on the same level as Vienna, relations have been sour since the last time our countries met at the table in 1927, when the man in Vienna tried to force us to accept the loss of Croatia."
ausgleich.new.101.a:0 "We shall see what comes of this."

ausgleich.new.102.t:0 "Hungary attends the Ausgleich Renegotiations"
ausgleich.new.102.d:0 "While there was some doubt whether Hungary would be willing to sort out the diplomatic differences between our two halves of the Empire, they have agreed"
ausgleich.new.102.a:0 "Naturally they do."

ausgleich.new.200.t:0 "Invite others to the Ausgleich?"
ausgleich.new.200.d:0 "The Ausgleich has always been conducted as a meeting of the Austrian and the Hungarian elite. However, we have had politicans Bohemia, Galicia and Illyria petition for a more open, multi-ethnical negotiations this year, with delegation from all contituent states of Empire present. \n\nAlso, gathering delegations from all of Austria-Hungary's corners might help mediate some of the internal tensions that have been going on since the Weltkrieg has ended."
ausgleich.new.200.a:0 "No way. This is between us and the Magyars."
ausgleich.new.200.b:0 "You are right. Invite the Bohemians, Galicians and Illyrians."
ausgleich.new.200.c:0 "We need to think bigger. Invite all peoples of the Dual Monarchy."

ausgleich.new.201.t:0 "Other Nations at the Ausgleich"
ausgleich.new.201.d:0 "Reportedly, Austria has sent for delegations from the other parts of the Empire to take part in the Ausgleich Renegotiations of 1937. Prominent Politicians have voiced their opposition to such an Ausgleich, calling it a political manoeuvre to give Austria the upper hand during the negotiations."
ausgleich.new.201.a:0 "This is an outrage. Formally protest their decision."
ausgleich.new.201.b:0 "Just protesting is not enough. We shall not take part in such an Ausgleich."
ausgleich.new.201.c:0 "We must go with the times."

ausgleich.new.202.d:0 "The rumours that have been circulating amongst the members of our local government have turned out to be true. A courier has arrived in Prague carrying an invitation to the Ausgleich negotiations. We are to send a Bohemian delegation to the negotiations.

ausgleich.new.211.d:0 "As if it weren't enough that the Viennese government has called for Czechs, Poles, and all the other ethnicities of the other side of the Empire to the negotiation table, reportedly they have done the same even for nationalist groups within our borders! \n\nThe Slovaks and Romanians in the Carpathian Basin had been subdued successfully for centuries, but support from Vienna has awoken underground nationalist movements from their slumber."

ausgleich.new.301.t:0 "The Delegations arrive"
ausgleich.new.301.d:0 "Despite the fear that Hungary would not take kindly to us having invited other delegations beside theirs to the negotiations, they have arrived in Vienna yesterday amongst the delegations from Bohemia, Galicia and Illyria. \n\nWhile this year's Ausgleich Renegotiations are attended by politicians and thinkers from all over the Empire, the Hungarians remain at the centre, since their problem is the most important to solve. The festivities lasted long into the night."
ausgleich.new.301.a:0 "What a night."

ausgleich.new.302.t:0 "The Delegations arrive - Hungary absent"
ausgleich.new.302.d:0 "It was feared that Hungary would not take kindly to us having invited other delegations beside theirs to the negotiations, and critics of the move had already suspected that they would boykott the occasion for that reason. \n\nNonteheless, the other delegations have arrived, and are willing to discuss how to solve the issue of a defiant Hungary. The festivities lasted long into the night."

ausgleich.new.310.t:0 "A Hungarian Delegatory holds a speech"
ausgleich.new.310.d:0 "On the first day of the negotiations, speeches were held. One Hungarian politican has delivered the following: \n\n"Are we not to be proud of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. For decades now the man in Vienna has strived to reform what was already perfect. I believe that Austria, and Hungary, together, have a part to play in the future of the world. Together, we shall make Austria-Hungary great again." \n\nWhile his copatriots were visibly disturbed by this implication that Kaiser Karl's federalisation politics were a mistake, he himself seemed rather pleased, despite the absence of applause."
ausgleich.new.310.a:0 "How insolent."
ausgleich.new.310.b:0 "Remove him from the negotiations."
ausgleich.new.310.c:0 "He's right though, isn't he?"

ausgleich.new.310.h:0 "He's right though, isn't he?"

ausgleich.new.311.t:0 "Hungary demands Reparation"
ausgleich.new.311.d:0 "As anticipated, the Hungarian delegation once again demands compensation for the loss of the territories of Croatia-Slavonia, that were in vassalage under the Hungarian Crown until 1925, when said territories were occupied by the a revolution of Southern Slavs, which ended with the cessation of the lands in 1926 to the newly reformed Kingdom of Illyria. \n\nThe Hungarian delegation still claims the lands as their own, but acknowledges that having them be under Hungarian control again is impossible. Therefore, like in 1927, they demand a hefty sum of money to be transferred to their treasury."
ausgleich.new.311.a:0 "Offer them to pay from our own coffers."
ausgleich.new.311.b:0 "This debt should be paid by the Illyrians."
ausgleich.new.311.c:0 "This debt should be paid by the Illyrians. Let's try to negotiate here."
ausgleich.new.311.e:0 "That is precisely why you pay less taxes now."
ausgleich.new.311.f:0 "If they miss Croatia-Slavonia that much, they might as well have it back."

ausgleich.new.312.t:0 "Bohemia proposes a Slovak State"
ausgleich.new.312.d:0 "In the vain of the discussions on the day before, the Bohemian delegation brings up the issue that is the Slovak people living under direct rule of the Hungarian Crown. Without any special rights or autonomy, the Slovak people have been the victim of an ongoing policy of Magyarisation. \n\nThe Bohemian delegation proposes the creation of an autonomous state for the Slovak people as a solution 'to free their brothers from the Magyar yoke'."
ausgleich.new.312.a:0 "How does this even concern you?"
ausgleich.new.312.b:0 "This is certainly a thing Hungary should consider."
ausgleich.new.312.c:0 "It should be done. Still, this requires further planning."

ausgleich.new.313.t:0 "Galicia demands Transcarpathia"
ausgleich.new.313.d:0 "Joining in on the recent trend of demanding Hungarian "
ausgleich.new.313.a:0 "The Ausgleich Negotiations are not a place to ask for territorial concessions."
ausgleich.new.313.b:0 "We cannot ask this of the Hungarians here and now."
ausgleich.new.313.c:0 "It should be done. Let us work towards it."

ausgleich.new.314.t:0 "Illyria demands the Banate"
ausgleich.new.314.d:0 "Joining in on the recent trend of demanding Hungarian land, Illyria now too demands cessation of the Bačka territory. While it is home to many Illyrians, claiming this strip of land in the southernmost region of Hungary is a rather audacious move by the Illyrian delegation, especially considering that Hungary is not yet formally recognising the South Slavic State."
ausgleich.new.314.a:0 "The Ausgleich Negotiations are not a place to ask for territorial concessions."
ausgleich.new.314.b:0 "We cannot ask this of the Hungarians here and now."

ausgleich.new.315.b:0 "Yes, it shall happen..."
ausgleich.new.315.c:0 "...and it shall touch the Danube."

ausgleich.new.316.t:0 "The Polish propose a Polish Protectorate"
ausgleich.new.316.d:0 "Several prominent members of the Polish delegation have endorsed a more active stance in our diplomatic relationship with Poland. While Poland was left to be in the German sphere after the War, the Galicians still see Poland as their homeland, now suppressed by Prussian rule. They wish for us to liberate their copatriots. \n\nPoland is not yet lost."
ausgleich.new.316.a:0 "We shall consider this."

ausgleich.new.317.t:0 "Ruthenians: demand Transcarpathia"
ausgleich.new.317.d:0 "The Ruthenian delegation reminds us that their brothers across the Carpathians are not even recognised by the Hungarian government."
ausgleich.new.317.a:0 "The Hungarian delegation should consider this."
ausgleich.new.317.b:0 "Yes, it shall happen."

ausgleich.new.318.t:0 "Illyrians: demand the Bačka Basin"
ausgleich.new.318.d:0 "The Illyrian delegation asks to be granted the Bačka Basin, which is mostly inhabited by Serbs; or so it was reported to be the last time we checked."
ausgleich.new.318.a:0 "The Hungarian delegation should consider this."
ausgleich.new.318.b:0 "Yes, it shall happen..."
ausgleich.new.318.c:0 "...and it shall include all of Bačka."

ausgleich.new.319.t:0 "Romanians: an autonomous Transylvania?"
ausgleich.new.319.d:0 "While Transylvania hold some recognition by Hungary, it is by no means near the level Cisleithanian states enjoy. The Romanian delegation puts in a word for being put on the same level as the states of the Austrian half."
ausgleich.new.319.a:0 "The Hungarian delegation should consider this."
ausgleich.new.319.b:0 "Yes, it shall happen..."
ausgleich.new.319.c:0 "...and it shall include all of Transylvania."



ausgleich.new.320.t:0 "The Ausgleich Negotiations are over"
ausgleich.new.320.d:0 "Today at dawn, the Hungarian delegation left for Budapest, to inform their government of what has transpired the last days, of the open arms that welcomed them in Vienna, and of their promised gains. The Ausgleich renegotiations of 1937 were a success, and things are looking up for the Dual Monarchy."
ausgleich.new.320.a:0 "Great."

ausgleich.new.321.t:0 "The End of the Ausgleich"
ausgleich.new.321.d:0 "The Ausgleich came to an end yesterday - when Hungary decided to leave them prematurely."
ausgleich.new.321.a:0 "Dreadful."

ausgleich.new.322.t:0 "Hungary leaves the Ausgleich"
ausgleich.new.322.d:0 "Having had enough of the "mockery of old traditions" that the Hungarian delegation calls this year's negotiations, they have left the discussions."

ausgleich.new.336.d:0 "Following the refusal of the Illyrian government to pay what they've described as "an outrageous demand of reparations for rightful Illyrian lands", the Hungarian government has declared war on the Illyrian Crown. Already, the Honvédség has begun marching into Slavonia, and it seems almost too late to intervene in the conflict in any meaningful way."
ausgleich.new.336.a:0 "This is outrageous."
