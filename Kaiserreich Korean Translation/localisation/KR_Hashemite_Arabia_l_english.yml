arabia.1.t:0 "Hashemite Arabia introduction"
arabia.1.d:0 "Under the control of regional powers such as Egypt and the Ottoman Empire through most of its history, the Kingdom of Hejaz gained political independence in the early 20th century. It was one of several regions of the Ottoman Empire provoked into rebellion by T. E. Lawrence (""of Arabia"") of the British during the Weltkrieg. In 1916, its independence was proclaimed by Hussein bin Ali, the Sharif of Mecca. Their hopes of freeing the Arabs north of them were curtailed by Britain's diversion of forces from the region and Ottoman propaganda campaigns after the Sykes-Pycot agreement was publicized by the Bolsheviks. When the British fell back past the Sinai and Mesopotamia after the Peace with Honour, the Arab revolters decided to make their stand in the region of Nejd and its capital, Riyadh. The Ottoman forces, strained after many years of war, were unable to overcome the Arab fighters and in the end a separate armistice was signed where the Kingdoms of Nejd and Hejaz were recognized as independent states. Soon after that, bin Ali was able to gain control over Nejd, annexing it to Hejaz in 1922. Thanks to the protection of Egypt, Hejaz has been able to survive until the present, and the decline of the Ottoman Empire may allow another attempt to free the Arabs still living under the Ottoman rule."

arabia.2.t:0 "Refugees from the Ottoman Empire"
arabia.2.d:0 "Ever since the Arab Congress in Cairo fleshed out the ambitions of the Arab Bloc, the Arabian vilayets of the Ottoman Empire have been in turmoil. Now Bedouins as well as Levantines cross the border to the Hedjaz, hoping to join the Shariffian forces in taking up arms against the Turkish menace."
arabia.2.a:0 "With the help of God and Cairo, we shall prevail!"

arabia.3.t:0 "Refugees from the Ottoman Empire"
arabia.3.d:0 "Ever since the Arab Congress in Cairo fleshed out the ambitions of the Arab Bloc, the Arabian vilayets of the Ottoman Empire have been in turmoil. Now Bedouins as well as Levantines cross the border to the Hedjaz, hoping to join the Shariffian forces in taking up arms against the Turkish menace."
arabia.3.a:0 "Our army grows ever larger!"

arabia.4.t:0 "Exchanging Letters with the Emir of Jabal Shammar"
arabia.4.d:0 "The various clans and emirates of Arabia all took different sides during the Weltkrieg and one of the most hotly contended was the Emirate of Jebel Shammar. The Rashidi emir Saud bin Abdulaziz remained neutral during the Arab Campaign and maintained cordial relations with the Turks, which allowed him to maintain a certain amount of autonomy from Istanbul. However, the Ottoman administration and authority has suffered greatly since the Arab Congress and bin Abdulaziz, opportunist to the very core, is starting to get worried what his fate would be once a successful Arab uprising displaces his Turkish overlords. Now might be a good time to offer, discretely of course, the emir a way out."
arabia.4.a:0 "Engage in clandestine contact with bin Abdulaziz!"
arabia.4.b:0 "We cannot trust that Turkish lapdog!"

arabia.5.t:0 "Rashidi Support!"

arabia.6.t:0 "Rashidi Scheming with the Hashemite Shariff"
arabia.6.d:0 "The Rashidi emir of Jabal Shamar is apparently conducting some kind of correspondence with the Arab traitor and so-called Shariff of Mecca, Faisal bin Hussein. This doesn't bode well for our hold on the region."
arabia.6.a:0 "What a shame..."

arabia.7.t:0 "A New Capital For Hashemite Arabia?"
arabia.7.d:0 "After our successful dislodgement of the Turkish oppressor, we now face the prospect of ruling a greater part of Arabia. In lieu of this change, it might be prudent to change our capital to a more centrally placed location."
arabia.7.a:0 "To Mecca, the most holy of all cities!"
arabia.7.b:0 "To Damascus! The dream of Lawrence and Faisal!"
arabia.7.c:0 "Baghdad, the Jewel of Mesopotamia!"

arabia.8.t:0 "Persian Ambitions in Mesopotamia"
