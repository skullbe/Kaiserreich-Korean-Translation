### Events ###
ethiopia.1.t:0 "Ethiopia, an Empire at the Crossroads"
ethiopia.1.d:0 "Ethiopia, also known as Abyssinia, was the only African state which managed to remain independent during the XIXth century Scramble for Africa, successfully defeating an Italian invasion in 1896. This victory kick started the process of modernisation in the Ethiopian Empire, in order to bring the country close to European standards regarding its economy, army and administration. In 1918, under empress Zauditu, the Ethiopian Empire entered the Weltkrieg on the side of the Germans, successfully annexing the Italian colonies of Somaliland and Eritrea. Another sign of Ethiopia's modernisation was the expansion of the DPAEB railroad, a vital transport link for the country. In 1930, Empress Zauditu died with no surviving children, which prompted her cousin Ras Tafari Makonnen to ascend the throne as Emperor Haile Selassie. The new monarch announced his intention to start a new series of reforms to bring Ethiopia 'into the west'. These initiatives, however, were fiercely opposed by the conservative nobility of the nation, who had been greatly strengthened by the annexation of the Italian colonies and the subsequent expansion of the army. Haile Selassie also faces opposition from the important Italian business community in Eritrea, who feel that any disturbance to the status quo will mean an end to their privileges. The imperial government, meanwhile, has suffered another blow in 1935, when a report by the German Ministry of Trade announced the fragile economic situation of the DPAEB, which puts the entire Ethiopian economy at risk - thus definitely proving the inefficiency of Ethiopia rallying to the German sphere. With an worldwide economic crisis approaching, Ethiopia may need to decide whether to continue its current relationship with Germany, seek new trade partners or pursue her own independent foreign policy."
ethiopia.1.a:0 "We stand strong!"
ethiopia.2.t:0 "The DPAEB and the approaching bankruptcy"
ethiopia.2.d:0 "The Deutsche Pan-Afrikanisches Eisenbahn (DPAEB) railway was established in the early 20th century, linking Addis Abeba to Djibouti. After a series of German-backed expansions, it is currently mainly used to transport ore from the Congo Basin, in Mittelafrika, to Djibouti. Now, the general economic downturn in the world has meant that less ore is being purchased, resulting in fewer transports for the DPAEB. The situation has now reached such a level that it is nearing bankruptcy."
ethiopia.2.a:0 "Keep it running!"
ethiopia.railway.bankruptcy:0 "Bankruptcy is looming!"
ethiopia.2.b:0 "Sell the railway"
ethiopia.3.t:0 "The DPAEB is sold"
ethiopia.3.d:0 "The Deutsche Pan-Afrikanisches Eisenbahn (DPAEB) railway was established in the early 20th century, linking Addis Abeba, in Ethiopia, to Djibouti. After a series of German-backed expansions, it is currently mainly used to transport ore from the Congo Basin, in Mittelafrika, to Djibouti. The present economic downturn in the world has meant that less ore is being purchased, resulting in fewer transports for the DPAEB. The situation has now reached such a level that Germany has decided to sell the railway."
ethiopia.3.a:0 "Buy the Ethiopian section of the railway"
ethiopia.3.b:0 "We must let German companies buy the railway"
ethiopia.4.a:0 "Buy the Mittelafrikan section of the railway"
ethiopia.4.b:0 "An European consortium ends up buying the railway"
ethiopia.5.t:0 "The DPAEB goes bankrupt!"
ethiopia.5.d:0 "Out decision to keep the Deutsche Pan-Afrikanisches Eisenbahn (DPAEB) running was indeed a short sighted one. The DPAEB, despite our attempts to revive it, has gone bankrupt!"
ethiopia.5.a:0 "Damn!"
ethiopia.6.d:0 "The Deutsche Pan-Afrikanisches Eisenbahn has gone bankrupt! Our main export link, running from the Congo to Djibouti, has been forced to close down. Large amounts of people now stand without a job."
ethiopia.6.a:0 "Damn..."
ethiopia.7.d:0 "The Deutsche Pan-Afrikanisches Eisenbahn has gone bankrupt! This major transport link, running from the Congo to Djibouti through Abyssinia, has been forced to close down. Large amounts of people now stand without a job."
ethiopia.7.a:0 "We will take it off their hands!"
ethiopia.8.t:0 "Drought!"
ethiopia.8.d:0 "A great drought is sweeping through eastern Abyssinia. With the economy already weakened by the decline of the DPAEB, we are facing mass starvation as crops fail."
ethiopia.8.a:0 "Damn!"
ethiopia.8.b:0 "Use the newly nationalised railway to distribute food!"
ethiopia.9.t:0 "The Cattle Dispute"
ethiopia.9.d:0 "The newly-privatised DPAEB in eastern Ethiopia has announced a plan to expand towards Mogadishu, in the Indian Ocean coast. As the European engineers started surveying the countryside in search for the optimum route, they came into contact with the traditional nobility of the area. Upon hearing that their traditional grazing lands would be the site of major construction works, the herders protested to the government."
ethiopia.9.a:0 "Ignore their protests, let the DPAEB expand"
ethiopia.railway.building:0 "The railway extension will continue to be constructed"
ethiopia.9.b:0 "Nationalise the railway and stop the expansion"
ethiopia.railway.buying:0 "We will obtain the railway"
ethiopia.10.t:0 "The Cattle War"
ethiopia.10.d:0 "The Addis Abeba-Mogadishu railroad was bound to create trouble. Concerned about the railroad being drawn across their land, the nobility in eastern Ethiopia have ordered the cattle herders to begin attacking the workers. The private consortium has brought in guards, and have killed a number of herders. Swift action is required unless this is going to escalate even further."
ethiopia.10.a:0 "Take the side of the private consortium"
ethiopia.10.b:0 "Take the side of the herders and local nobility"
ethiopia.railway.damage:0 "The railway is damaged by the herders"

ethiopia.12.t:0 "Addis Abeba - Mogadishu Railroad complete!"
ethiopia.12.d:0 "After much trouble, the railway linking our capital Addis Abeba to the Indian Ocean port of Mogadishu has been completed! This will bring us much revenue and will expand our industry!"
ethiopia.12.a:0 "At long last!"
ethiopia.13.t:0 "The Railway and the Demands it Placed"
ethiopia.13.d:0 "The privatisation of the DPAEB was a major economic gain for Mittelafrika, but a great political loss. The railway company simply grew too powerful for the Staathalter to handle, and it began getting itself political influence. It began by demanding to have a say in all actions performed by the Staathalter, and continued by demanding total control over the Mittelafrikan economy."
ethiopia.13.a:0 "It is dirty, but we need the railway"
ethiopia.13.b:0 "They can take their railway and put it where the sun doesn't shine!"
ethiopia.14.t:0 "Black Monday hits Ethiopia"
ethiopia.14.d:0 "A major economic crisis has hit the German Empire. The Berlin Stock Exchange has hit an all-time low and, as a consequence, hundreds of enterprises across Europe are going bankrupt and millions of workers are left unemployed worldwide. The crisis will reflect in our country as well, since European markets will be shut for Ethiopian natural resources for the time..."
ethiopia.14.a:0 "This is a tragedy!"
ethiopia.15.t:0 "One year after the Berlin Crisis"
ethiopia.15.d:0 "It's been one year since the Black Monday crisis hit the Berlin Stock Exchange and, as a consequence, most of the world's economy. Over the past twelve months, European markets have reopened to Ethiopian trade and, thus, our economy has recovered. It will be some time before our industrial capacity fully reaches pre-crisis levels, but we're on the right path at least!"
ethiopia.15.a:0 "Good!"
ethiopia.16.t:0 "The extent of noble power"
ethiopia.16.d:0 "As the emperor has decided to work together with the nobles, the question arose as to how much power would be given to their hands..."
ethiopia.16.a:0 "Give them some important civil and military offices"
ethiopia.16.b:0 "The nobles serve their country best in the military"
ethiopia.16.c:0 "Give them control over the civil offices"
ethiopia.16.e:0 "Total noble control"
ETH_Total_Control:0 "It will be harder for us to refuse the nobility"
ethiopia.17.t:0 "The Fate of the Reforms"
ethiopia.17.d:0 "Having secured control over several vital government offices, the nobility has begun pressing for the discontinuation of most of the liberal reforms of Haile Selassie I. If the negus negast decides to continue the reforms, they might use their power against him."
ethiopia.17.a:0 "The nobles be damned, the reforms will continue"
ethiopia.18.t:0 "The Time of Troubles"
ethiopia.18.d:0 "Faced with the stubborn refusal of Haile Selassie I to end his reforms, several of the aristocrats and conservative politicians have ordered their militias to take up arms against the emperor, most notably in the disgruntled eastern provinces."
ethiopia.18.a:0 "Hell! To arms!"
ethiopia.19.t:0 "To Arms!"
ethiopia.19.d:0 "No one should see this... ;)"
ethiopia.19.a:0 "Forward, to glory!"
ethiopia.20.t:0 "Ethiopia is no more!"
ethiopia.20.d:0 "The decrepit regime of Ethiopia is no more. Haile Selassie has been deposed and fled the country, and his reforms brought to a halt!"
ethiopia.20.a:0 "Imperial Ethiopia forever!"
ethiopia.21.t:0 "Addis Ababa has fallen!"
ethiopia.21.d:0 "The capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, has fallen to rebel hands today. Haile Selassie has been forced to flee the country to Germany along with his pro-reforms cabinet. The military, on Selassie's final order, has surrendered to avoid any further bloodshed. The fate of the reforms looks bleak in the hands of the Imperial Council and the nobility that lead it."
ethiopia.21.a:0 "Good riddance!"
ethiopia.21.b:0 "The last free African power falls - to its own people!"
ethiopia.22.t:0 "Elections"

The main parties that are participating are - the Mesafint/Mekwanint Party, the right-wing 'Forum for Democratic Dialogue in Ethiopia', the centre-right 'United Ethiopian Democratic Forces', the centre-left 'Coalition for Unity and Democracy' & the left-wing 'Ethiopian People's Democratic Front' Choose wisely - elections happen every 5 years!"

ethiopia.23.a:0 "To war!"
ethiopia.23.b:0 "It was just some sand anyway"
ethiopia.24.t:0 "Ethiopia seizes German Somaliland!"
ethiopia.24.d:0 "The Ethiopians have marched their troops into German Somaliland and are proclaiming it theirs! The Germans, calling an emergency conference of their highest officials, have decided to let the Ethiopians take it, choosing to file a diplomatic complain instead of going to war. The Ethiopian leader, Haile Selassie, has stated in his speech of victory that he cares not for the complaint, especially from a crippled Germany, further adding 'The rightful annexation is indeed a victory for the African People, one that will keep the Pan-African Dream alive!'"
ethiopia.24.a:0 "Rejoice!"
ethiopia.24.b:0 "An Interesting Development"
ethiopia.25.t:0 "Ethiopia seizes German Somaliland!"
ethiopia.25.d:0 "The Ethiopians have marched their troops into German Somaliland and are proclaiming it theirs! The Germans, calling an emergency conference of their highest officials, have decided that this could not be tolerated, and have chosen to go to war with Ethiopia. Many are calling it a foolish move - an already shattered Germany has little to give against the newly industrialised and reformed Ethiopia, which insists they have a plan for this situation."
