amcivwar.417.d:0 "Success! Our small squadron was able to slip into New York harbour before insurgent naval forces could be mobilised, and even though they took losses from snipers stationed high in the skyline, they were able to link up with the loyalists after their successful breakout! \n\nThe commander of the naval squadron and many of the evacuees, who fought tooth and nail against the Syndicalists, are being honoured as heroes!"

amcivwar.419.d:0 "Success! Our militia commanders successfully exploited the vulnerability of the US squadron, preparing an extensive ambush with use of both water mines as well as an ad-hoc improvised aerial attack! The Statue of Liberty took some damage, but we were able to prohibit the squadron from leaving the harbour until they finally surrendered.\n\nThe militias - but especially its commander - who fought tooth and nail against the Counter-revolutionaries, are being honoured as heroes!"

Our info - coming from the Stock Exchange radio station - is thin, but it seems when the squadron finally surrendered, the pinned down loyalists laid down their arms as well.\n\nThe commander of the squadron will face a trial for his failures - once the war is won, that is."

amcivwar.421.d:0 "For the second time in the history of our nation, Fort Sumter in South Carolina has come under shelling by insurrectionist artillery. Our garrison is frantically radioing us, asking for a fleet detachment to sail down there and pick them up.\n\nThis would be a highly risky task, but could land us an incredible propaganda coup - and also a few highly needed additional troops. What should we do?"

amcivwar.422.d:0 "We currently have most of Charleston under our control - apart from Fort Sumter, which was only recently re-built. According to the latest intel, the US are sending a small naval squadron to evacuate their troops! This squadron will not be able to threaten our position in Charleston; Their only goal will be to get their allies out of the Fort.\n\nWe could now either rally an im-promptu blockade to hold the siege against the naval reinforcements or hope that our artillery currently present will be enough. What shall we do?"

Fort Sumter was completely destroyed in the ensuing shelling, and so was most of the squadron - our river boat flotilla could only pick up a few dozen survivors afterwards.\n\nThe militia commander is being honoured as a hero!"
