### CSA Flavor Events ###
amcivwar.29.t:0 "붉은 해군의 조직"
amcivwar.29.c:0 "The Admirals of the United States have prevented any of their ships from being liberated by the workers and thus we are deprived of a navy. To solve that, those admirals that joined the revolution and the countless dock workers are planning on building up a new navy. We do have quite a number of ships in New York that we can convert to warships. We can either go with destroyers or cruisers. What shall we go for?"
amcivwar.29.a:0 "구축함"
amcivwar.29.b:0 "순양함"

amcivwar.30.t:0 "중앙 위원회 지시 #10: 물질 자산의 재분배를 통제하는 규제"
amcivwar.30.d:0 "Now that the revolution has begun, we must decide what should be done to the bourgeoisie. Many are advocating that we confiscate all their wealth and redistribute it to the people, with a small, but vocal minority even calling for their execution. The more pragmatic members of the CSA, however, think it might be necessary to work with them in order for victory to be achieved, and that redistribution should be kept to a minimum for the time being."
amcivwar.30.a:0 "그들의 부는 노동자들한테서 훔쳐간 것이다!"
amcivwar.30.b:0 "그들의 협력이 필요하다. 지금은 형식적으로만 재분배하라."

amcivwar.31.t:0 "부유층의 도망"
amcivwar.31.d:0 "The bourgeoise have decided that they will flee the CSA. Many have sought refuge within enemy territory and even in Canada. The thieving scum have taken whatever of their stolen wealth they could carry with them as they have escaped the revolution."
amcivwar.31.a:0 "때가 되면 혁명이 그들에게 닥칠 것이다."

amcivwar.32.t:0 "전쟁 중의 삶"
amcivwar.32.d:0 "The revolution has brought a number of changes throughout the land that we control. In the various towns and cities, the bourgeoise and their oppression seem to have vanished for the most part. Women and foreigners are now a common sight in factories and offices. Every shop and cafe had an inscription saying that it had been collectivized. Servile and ceremonial forms of speech, especially those denoting class-based hierarchies, had all but disappeared. Most people, at least in public, now shun the gaudy fashion that had been so typical of the past decade's America in favour of functional working-class clothing, or some variation on military uniforms."
amcivwar.32.a:0 "혁명은 더 밝은 미래를 만들 것이다."

amcivwar.33.t:0 "중앙 위원회 지시 #213: 전쟁 생디칼리즘"
amcivwar.33.d:0 "As the war stalemates and perhaps may even turn against us, the central committee is debating a comprehensive economic reform proposal known as 'War Syndicalism.' Some of its proposals, such as state control of all foreign trade, nationalization of all factories, strict labour discipline are not especially controversial, but it also includes potentially problematic measures such as the outlawing of strikes, obligatory labour-duty for those not working or in the military, strict rationing, banning private enterprise, requisition of agricultural food, and military control over railroads and other infrastructure. This is controversial within the government with a number saying that some of the latter measures, especially the outlawing of strikes would betray the values of the revolution, and make the current government no better than its capitalist enemies. Those supporting the proposal counter that it is necessary in order to achieve victory in the revolution, and that the first laws passed after the end of the war will revert War Syndicalism."
amcivwar.33.a:0 "전쟁 생디칼리즘을 제정하라"
amcivwar.33.b:0 "우리 고유의 가치를 배반할 수는 없다!"

amcivwar.34.t:0 "붉은 마녀"
amcivwar.34.d:0 "Gender equality has long been a major ideological component of socialist thought, and we have yet more evidence that it works! A squadron of female pilots has earned renown throughout the CSA for their daring raids on enemy territory, their coordinated and synchronized attack formations allowing them to take down larger enemy air forces with ease. Derisively named the 'Red Witches' by the reactionary forces under Huey Long, the squadron, led by Florence 'Pancho' Barnes, has taken their new nickname up with a great deal of pride."
amcivwar.34.a:0 "Death is in the air"

amcivwar.35.t:0 "여성 병사"
amcivwar.35.d:0 "As the Revolutionary struggle continues a number of women have joined the armed struggle in accordance with the socialist ideals of gender equality. While not all are accepted by their male comrades, some of whom still struggle to free themselves of their ideological conditioning by their old capitalist masters, it has not deterred many from fighting and dying for the revolution."
amcivwar.35.a:0 "That's the Rebel Girl, the Rebel Girl!"

amcivwar.36.t:0 "내부 분쟁"
amcivwar.36.d:0 "It has often been said that the greatest enemy of the Left is not the capitalists, but themselves. Though overstated, this phenomenon has reared its ugly head in the intense conflict between some factions of the CSA, most notably between the Vanguardists and Anarchists. In some cases, this conflict has moved beyond words, manifesting as ugly brawls and even, in extreme cases, as friendly fire incidents. This clearly cannot be tolerated if we are to emerge triumphant in the Civil War, and we must choose whether we should pick a side, or force a compromise until the revolution is over. "
amcivwar.36.a:0 "Side with the Anarchists"
amcivwar.36.b:0 "Force a compromise"
amcivwar.36.c:0 "Side with the Vanguardists"

amcivwar.37.t:0 "중앙 위원회 지시 #656: 동계 자원 할당 계획([GetYear]년)"
amcivwar.37.d:0 "The revolution must succeed, but the revolution is also for the people. When supporting the revolution and supporting the people are the same, the choice is trivial, but when one must be prioritized over the other, hard choices must be made. The Central Committee has been made aware that the supply situation is critical, and either the people or the army must be undersupplied through the winter. "

amcivwar.37.b:0 "Prioritize the Army"

amcivwar.38.t:0 "중앙 위원회 지시 #764: 혁명교육법"
amcivwar.38.d:0 "To those who are well educated, either formally or through bitter experience, revolutionary thought comes as easily as breathing. However, many of our comrades, whether in the Steel Belt or elsewhere in America, have been lied to their entire lives by the capitalists, and do not understand how the revolution frees them. Many do not give their heart and soul to the revolution, and some even attempt to sabotage our efforts, unaware that we are the only force that truly cares for them. This must be remedied, and our comrades must be deprogrammed. Should we focus on reaching those in our territory, keeping our own morale up, or should we spread our message throughout enemy territory, and sap their will to fight their liberators? "
amcivwar.38.a:0 "Focus on the Home Front"
amcivwar.38.b:0 "Focus on the Enemy"

amcivwar.39.t:0 "중앙 위원회 지시 #984: 전쟁 전 자본주의 정치인들의 판결"
amcivwar.39.d:0 "As the revolution nears success, the people demand that we deal with the corrupt, capitalist politicians in office before the revolution who now rot in our cells. Some believe that by having these politicians work hard labour for a few years, they will empathize with the worker, and be converted to our cause. Others believe that no amount of education can reform them, and they must remain behind bars for the rest of their lives. A small, but vocal minority insists that they must be executed for their crimes, like the Romanovs or the Bourbon dynasties of old. "
amcivwar.39.a:0 "They shall be redeemed by the sweat on their brows and the ache of their backs"
amcivwar.39.b:0 "They shall watch as the world leaves them behind and makes them irrelevant"

amcivwar.40.t:0 "중앙 위원회 지시 #1231: 첩보 활동을 위한 위원회 창설"
amcivwar.40.d:0 "It is an unfortunate fact that there are spies and saboteurs within our territory working to prevent our glorious liberation of the proletarian masses. Of the many proposals submitted to the Central Committee, one stands out. Earl Browder's proposal is to create a committee to enforce revolutionary order and stop counter-revolutionary sabotage. However, others within the central committee, including Chairman Reed, wonder if this is a necessary step and if we would be betraying our ideals. Regardless, a vote was taken. What was decided?"
amcivwar.40.a:0 "The Committee for Intelligence Activities will be created!"
amcivwar.40.b:0 "It is not necessary for now."

amcivwar.41.t:0 "적색 테러"
amcivwar.41.d:0 "War is hell. Civil war, even more so. The psychological strain caused by having to repeatedly kill, even if the enemy are capitalist lapdogs, has caused some of our soldiers and commanders to become sadistic beyond what some consider to be acceptable. Although not commonplace, reports of systematic mass executions and torture are being reported from both the front lines and core territories to suppress populations suspected of aiding the capitalists. Perhaps these tactics are necessary, but it leaves a sour taste in the mouths of the idealistic members of the Central Committee."
amcivwar.41.a:0 "A revolution is not a dinner party"

amcivwar.42.t:0 "중앙 위원회 지시 #1398: CCD 64 개정안, 최소 징병 연령 관리"
amcivwar.42.d:0 "The war is not going our way. The detestable capitalists have pushed back our forces on all fronts, and we are in danger of running out of troops to man the guns we have. Desperate times require desperate measures, and one proposal, by William Z. Foster that has caused controversy is the proposal to lower the conscription age to 11. While this would provide us with the manpower needed to fight the revolution, quite a number of members of the Central Committee have expressed horror at this drastic measure."

amcivwar.46.t:0 "이성에 호소"
amcivwar.46.d:0 "Charles Lindbergh has arranged a meeting between Huey Long and a number of leading industrialists including Henry Ford, Fred Koch, and H.L. Hunt. These men are inclined to close their factories and refineries within the South to comply with orders from the Federal Government. However, they are instead persuaded by Lindbergh to stick up for Huey Long and move their business empires into the American Union State on a few conditions. They ask that Huey Long guarantee some sort of political exception to them in these dire economic times as well as a promise of political office once the war is won. If Long agrees to their demand, it will give them greater influence and many of his supporters will wonder if he plans on betraying his ideals. However, refusing in such a time may prove costly."
amcivwar.46.a:0 "Agree to their reasoning"

amcivwar.47.t:0 "전쟁 산업 위원회"
amcivwar.47.d:0 "Business leaders within our territory have formed a committee ostensibly in support of Huey Long in order to coordinate the war effort on his behalf called the War Industries Committee. Just as Huey Long himself had created offices to handle the monumental task of fighting for America, so did the industrialists take it upon themselves to create an industrial institution. Though they do not have all the power that they were promised, they have declared themselves to be the arsenal of the Republic, and are led by controversially antisemitic but respected General George Van Horn Moseley. "
amcivwar.47.a:0 "We should keep an eye on them"

amcivwar.48.t:0 "충성 맹세"
amcivwar.48.d:0 "One of the more unusual well-wishers to visit Huey Long is an eccentric but passionate man named William Dudley Pelley. Pelley is the leader of an all-white Legionarist political and religious social club called the Silver Legion. His membership size is moderate but his enthusiasm for Huey Long's ideals is unsettlingly enthusiastic. Pelley has come with a request for money to take on an evangelistic and patriotic tour of America to gather supporters for the American Union State. This proposal would imply to Huey's followers that he supports the fledgling Christian Identity movement, which clashes with his personal distaste for the political ideology of Klansmen and Prohibitionists. How shall we respond?"
amcivwar.48.a:0 "We agree to this deal"

amcivwar.49.t:0 "은색 군단"
amcivwar.49.d:0 "Along the way during the national tour, William Pelley came into contact with radio preacher Herbert W. Armstrong. In order to raise an army for the American Union State in favour of what they see as a moral war, they have officially combined their beliefs to form the Pelley-Armstrong line. This has swelled the Silver Legion into the tens of thousands of members from all across the country, and reports of their speeches have come in. In inclusion to the strongly anti-Catholic and pro-segregationist rhetoric at these speeches are promises that are said to come from Huey Long in favour of almost extraordinary wages for whites and benefits for veterans after the civil war. As these have entered the rumour mill there is nothing we can do to stop these promises from spreading. "

amcivwar.221.a:0 "We will have to be independent."
amcivwar.221.b:0 "Turn to National France instead"

amcivwar.222.t:0 "Liberia stands alone"
amcivwar.222.d:0 "The tiny nation of Liberia has broken away from US protection and is now alone. We could try to seize the lands for ourselves, although this would not be a popular move among both allies and enemies."
amcivwar.222.a:0 "We have no ambitions on Liberia"
amcivwar.222.b:0 "They are unprotected - seize their lands!"

amcivwar.223.t:0 "Liberia stands alone"

amcivwar.224.t:0 "The French attack"
amcivwar.224.d:0 "The greedy, imperialist French have decided to attack us as we have no protector. We have no choice but to fight for our survival."
amcivwar.224.a:0 "Mobilise as many men as possible."

amcivwar.225.t:0 "The German-Afrikaans attack"
amcivwar.225.d:0 "Taking advantage of our diplomatic isolation, the German administration in Mittelafrika has decided to attack us. We have no choice but to fight for our survival."
amcivwar.225.a:0 "Mobilise as many men as possible."

amcivwar.226.t:0 "Independence in the Philippines"
amcivwar.226.d:0 "The civil war in America has left the American hold over the Philippines weakened. The people of the Philippines are demanding full independence but some in the government are worried that an independent Philippines will be absorbed by the greater powers in the area."
amcivwar.226.a:0 "Freedom. Horrible, horrible freedom."

amcivwar.227.t:0 "Seizing American Equipment"
amcivwar.227.d:0 "With the Americans heading off the island, they have left large amounts of equipment in the Philippines. The Filipino army is advocating seizing the resources while they are unguarded but the government is afraid of what this might do to the relations between the two countries."
amcivwar.227.a:0 "Seize the equipment"
amcivwar.227.b:0 "We should stay friendly"

amcivwar.228.t:0 "The American Mission in the Philippines"
amcivwar.228.d:0 "The war has forced the US government to recall all available units. The American forces in the Philippines are still loyal to the US government and Douglas MacArthur. Some are concerned that abandoning the Philippines will be costly but the forces are needed in America."
amcivwar.228.a:0 "Recall the units"
amcivwar.228.b:0 "We must hold our position"

amcivwar.229.t:0 "The Philippine Commonwealth"
amcivwar.229.d:0 "The Americans had never promised the Filipino people independence and forces inside the country wanted to use the American Civil War as an opportunity to declare independence and form a legitimate government. The Commonwealth of the Philippines was created to administer the nation and transition into a full state of independence."
amcivwar.229.a:0 "Our glorious new commonwealth"

amcivwar.230.t:0 "United States in disarray"
amcivwar.230.d_1:0 "The civil war has erupted in the United States, tearing apart the last shreds of unity in the Union. American influence on our government has in a matter of days all but collapsed and this development also presents us with the chance to fully remove the American presence from Cuba by occupying Guantanamo Bay naval base. There is very little that the US government can do to stop us at this point."
amcivwar.230.d_2:0 "Having broken free from the United States and the civil war raging still, the status of the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay has arisen. Should we seize this last piece of occupied Cuban soil?"
amcivwar.230.a:0 "Seize the naval base!"
amcivwar.230.b:0 "Rather not"

amcivwar.231.t:0 "Cuba Seizes Guantanamo naval base"
amcivwar.231.d:0 "With America in turmoil, Cuba has moved its troops onto the USA-leased Guantanamo Bay naval base. There is very little that the US government can do to stop Cuba at this point."
amcivwar.231.a:0 "Too bad"

amcivwar.232.t:0 "United States in Disarray"
amcivwar.232.d:0 "Turmoil has broken the union and the United States had erupted into civil war. With the federal government unable to exert a modicum of the influence it once had, our status as all but a puppet of the United States has become increasingly flimsy. Should we expel the Americans from our government or remain loyal?"
amcivwar.232.a:0 "Break Free"
amcivwar.232.b:0 "Stay Loyal"

amcivwar.233.t:0 "Cuba Defies Us"
amcivwar.233.d:0 "Cuba has broken its obligations to us and treaties concerning our relationship and arrest several American citizens influential in Cuba. With the civil war raging, we have lost much of our influence in the country."
amcivwar.233.a:0 "Horrible"

amcivwar.234.t:0 "Our Friends in Havana"
amcivwar.234.d:0 "In spite of the civil war and subsequent collapse of our influence in their nation, Cuba has promised to remain by our side and not only support our war against the traitors, but offer to provide us with materiel where possible as well. As their loyalty seems assured and we can no longer effectively administer our naval base at Guantanamo Bay, it may be wise to transfer control of the bay over to the Cubans. Whether this will be a temporary or permanent solution, only time will tell."
amcivwar.234.a:0 "Give it to them"
amcivwar.234.b:0 "Keep it"

amcivwar.235.t:0 "The United States Returns Guantanamo Bay"

amcivwar.235.a:0 "Great!"

amcivwar.236.t:0 "The United States Defeated"
amcivwar.236.d:0 "The United States of America has been defeated. While this will of course also destroy their influence over our government and many loyalist politicians will be granted asylum, without our friend in Washington, our regime faces a great deal of uncertainty."
