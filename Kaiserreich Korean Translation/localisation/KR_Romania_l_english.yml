### Events ###
romania.0.t:0 "[From.GetName]"
romania.0.d:0 "Following the independence from the Ottoman Empire under King Carol in 1878 Romania began its slow process of modernisation and of turning to the west. In 1913 it entered the Second Balkan War, tipping the balance against Bulgaria and subsequently annexing southern Dobrogea from them.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Weltkrieg in 1914 Romania initially remained neutral but would join the Entente in 1916, led by Carol's successor Ferdinand. After a failed attempt to invade Transylvania, nearly 2/3 of the country was occupied by the Central Powers. Even though the army fought an effective defensive war from its last remaining holdout in Moldova, the government was forced, following the Russian collapse, to sign the Treaty of Bucharest in 1918. The southern part of Dobrogea was returned to Bulgaria, Oltenia was de-militarised, the oilfields were leased to Germany until 2012 and various other sectors of the economy became dominated by German and Austrian companies, with Romania getting the province of Bessarabia from the fallen Russian Empire in return.\n\nAfter the death of Ferdinand in 1927, the military managed to effectively seize the reigns of government, installing the 6 year old Michael, Ferdinand's grandson, as their puppet king, completely bypassing Carol II, the late king's disgraced son. Of the various groups which collaborated with the military, the right-wing Iron Guard, led by Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, proved the most dangerous. They managed to acquire more and more power within the state apparatus, eventually violently ousting the part of the military government still opposing them in 1935 and setting Codreanu up as the new Conducător, while the young king fled the country.\n\nCodreanu now rules over a divided nation, promising to restore Romania to its former greatness, throw off the shackles of its oppression and be rid of its enemies both foreign and domestic."

romania.28.d:0 "Serbia, wishing to maintain positive relations with Romania, handed Codreanu and the entire leadership of the Iron Guard back to Romania. What should we do with these traitors to the Romanian state?"
romania.28.a:0 "Hang them high!"
romania.28.b:0 "Imprison them for the rest of their lives."

romania.29.t:0 "Serbia refuses to extradite the Iron Guard leadership"
romania.29.d:0 "The Serbian government stated that they will not extradite Codreanu and the rest of the Iron Guard leadership to stand trial in Romania."

romania.30.t:0 "Royalist coup crushed!"
romania.30.d:0 "Iasi and Chisinev along with the rest of Moldova has fallen before our brave soldiers. The remaining soldiers loyal to the treacherous royalists are surrendering in droves, and our forces are retaking power in the streets of our major cities."
romania.30.a:0 "Long live the Iron Guard!"
romania.30.tt:0 "Parts of the rebels' army are seized."

romania.31.t:0 "Iron Guard terror"
romania.31.d:0 "During the ongoing civil war some of our commanders started to use rather doubtful methods to permanently suppress the civilian populations suspected of helping our mortal enemies. Such policies, even if they look drastic are necessary in these dark times."
romania.31.a:0 "War is war"

romania.32.t:0 "Monarchist terror"
romania.32.d:0 "During the ongoing civil war some of our commanders started to use rather doubtful methods to permanently suppress the civilian populations suspected of helping our mortal enemies. Such policies, even if they look drastic are necessary in these dark times."
romania.32.a:0 "War is war"

romania.33.t:0 "Romania claims Transylvania"
romania.33.d:0 "The Iron Guard government of Romania has pressed their claims on Transylvania. In some parts of Transylvania the population already is majority Romanian, and now Romania has claimed the whole of Transylvania, including Cluj and Banat."
romania.33.a:0 "Transylvania is [This.GetAdjective]!"

romania.34.t:0 "The oil of Ploiesti"
romania.34.d:0 "After Romania's defeat in the Weltkrieg, we were promised control over the rich oilfields of Ploesti. Our spies report however that the current dictator, Codreanu, is about to nationalise the oilfields. With the current crisis though, any open attempt to stop him would spark fears of war and drive away capital, wrecking us financially. What should we do?"
romania.34.a:0 "Bribe ministers and offer promises."
romania.34.b:0 "Arrange an 'accident' for Codreanu."
romania.34.c:0 "Do nothing."

romania.35.t:0 "Ministerial concerns"
romania.35.d:0 "Several of our ministers, including prime minister A.C. Cuza, have expressed concern about the planned nationalisation of the oilfields and fear moving against Germany. They also point out the promises made by the German ambassador and urge our great leader to find a compromise."
romania.35.a:0 "Cowards!"

romania.36.t:0 "Bribery scandal"
romania.36.d:0 "Party Vice President Sima has accused several ministers, including Prime Minister A.C. Cuza, of receiving bribes and working for Germany, calling them 'the worse kind of traitors' at last nights party meeting. Meanwhile Cuza accused Sima of being a power-hungry backstabber who would sell out his own mother if he thought it might help him. What shall we do?"
romania.36.a:0 "Nothing but lies!"
romania.36.b:0 "Sima is right. A.C. Cuza is a traitor."

romania.37.t:0 "Execution of A.C. Cuza"
romania.37.d:0 "Prime Minister A.C. Cuza has proven to be a liability and a threat to our great leader's authority, and, by extension, a threat to the Romanian nation."
romania.37.a:0 "There is only one fate for enemies of the people."

romania.38.t:0 "Assassination attempt"
romania.38.d:0 "An assassin tried to shoot our great Leader today. Luckily his bodyguards intervened in time and he is unharmed. The assassin was killed in the exchange, but sadly with nothing on him to allow us to identify him."
romania.38.a:0 "This was the work of a lone madman."
romania.38.b:0 "It must have been a monarchist"
romania.38.c:0 "Obviously a foreign agent. But from where?"

romania.39.t:0 "Assassination of the Romanian leader failed"
romania.39.d:0 "Unfortunately, our assassin has failed. We knew killing Codreanu was a long shot, but it was worth the try. We can expect Codreanu to nationalise the oilfields any day now. If he also stops the shipments, we may have no choice but to invade."
romania.39.a:0 "It was worth a try."

romania.40.t:0 "Cuza protests"
romania.40.d:0 "Prime Minister A.C. Cuza has spoken out against 'the indiscriminate violence perpetrated by paramilitary groups affiliated with the party', and even had the audacity to call for those responsable to be 'brought before justice'. According to party Vice President Sima, he even began secret talks with party leaders about his bid for party presidency."
romania.40.a:0 "This traitor must be stopped!"

romania.41.t:0 "Violence against suspected monarchists"
romania.41.d:0 "News that Codreanu's attacker had been a supporter of the old regime has spread like wildfire. Paramilitary Iron Guard groups have begun attacking all those known or suspected to have ties with the former King or his supporters, as well as settling some old scores in the process. Prime Minister A.C. Cuza is reportedly very upset about this turn of events."
romania.41.a:0 "A.C. Cuza orders the police to end violence."
romania.41.b:0 "Nothing is worse than traitors in our midst!"

romania.42.t:0 "Violence against foreigners"
romania.42.d:0 "Individuals and businesses belonging to foreigners, as well as to various ethnic minorities, have begun to come under increasing attack in the streets following the failed plot against Codreanu. Worse, paramilitary Iron Guard groups seem to be at the forefront of such actions. Prime Minister A.C. Cuza is reportedly very upset about this turn of events."
romania.42.a:0 "A.C. Cuza orders the police to end violence."
romania.42.b:0 "Foreigners are a plague upon our nation!"

romania.43.t:0 "The Romanians have nationalised the Ploiesti oil fields!"
romania.43.d:0 "After Romania's defeat in the Weltkrieg, we were promised control over the rich oilfields of Ploiesti. The current dictator, Codreanu, taking advantage of the state of our economy, has just nationalised the oilfields with much fanfare, yet didn't dare stop the oil shipments and also promised to compensate our oil companies. Opposing him at this point would likely frighten investors even more, potentially killing any chance of stopping our current economic crisis."
romania.43.a:0 "Okay, but we will be watching them."

romania.44.t:0 "Romania declares the Bucharest Treaty dead"
romania.44.d:0 "In our darkest hour the treacherous Romanians have decided to stab us in the back and stop their oil shipments. One day they will pay for their treachery."

romania.45.t:0 "Plebiscite in Dobrudzha?"
romania.45.d:0 "Since the end of Weltkrieg, Dobrudzha is a part of our homeland. The new Romanian government has the audacity to ask us to launch a plebiscite to determine the destiny of our rightful territory - Dobrudzha. No doubt, that in case of a real plebiscite, there is a chance that we will lose this province. What shall we do?"
romania.45.a:0 "No way."
romania.45.b:0 "Allow it, but rig the results."
romania.45.c:0 "Allow the plebiscite."
romania.45.tt1:0 "the people vote for union with Romania."
romania.45.tt2:0 "the people vote to remain part of Bulgaria."

romania.46.t:0 "Bulgaria refused the plebiscite!"
romania.46.d:0 "The Bulgarian government doesn't want to give the people a chance to choose their destiny! What will we do?"
romania.46.a:0 "Send the army!"
romania.46.b:0 "We can't do anything at the moment."

romania.47.t:0 "Bulgaria rigs the plebiscite!"
romania.47.d:0 "The government of Bulgaria has seen reason and agreed to give the people of Dobrudzha a plebiscite to determine whether they want to rejoin Romania. However, we have been informed that there are certain irregularities in the procedure which will probably result in a negative result of the plebiscite. What shall we do?"
romania.47.a:0 "Never mind, we shall await the results."
romania.47.b:0 "How dare they? Send the army to reclaim Dobrudzha!"

romania.48.t:0 "The result of the Dobrudzha plebiscite"
romania.48.d:0 "The Plebiscite has passed yesterday. Most of the population of Dobrudzha chose our state! The question is, will Bulgaria hand over the province?"
romania.48.a:0 "They better do."

romania.49.t:0 "Dobrudzha refuses unification"
romania.49.d:0 "The plebiscite has passed. People of Dobrudzha have refused our proposition. We can't take the province back at the moment."
romania.49.a:0 "Awful."

romania.50.t:0 "Transfer of territory"
romania.50.d:0 "The plebiscite has resulted in a vote for union with Romania, so we must transfer Dobrudzha to them."
romania.50.a:0 "Democracy has minuses."
romania.50.b:0 "Refuse to transfer Dobrudzha!"

romania.51.t:0 "Dobrudzha joins Romania"
romania.51.d:0 "Bulgaria has decided to honour the results of the plebiscite and has handed over Dobrudzha to us."

romania.52.t:0 "Bulgaria ignores the result of the plebiscite!"
romania.52.d:0 "Despite the people voting for union with Romania, the government of Bulgaria has decided to ignore the results of the plebiscite and refuses to hand over Dobrudzha."

romania.55.d:0 "Our glorious army has successfully conducted a full-scale invasion of Romania and now its armed forces are utterly vanquished. We can offer the Romanians peace in exchange for the disputed territory of Bessarabia. Desperate as they are, the Romanians will likely accept this offer."
romania.55.a:0 "Offer peace."
romania.55.b:0 "We fight on!"

romania.56.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] armies have conducted a successful invasion of Bessarabia and Moldova. Now their government offers us peace, on the terms that we cede Bessarabia to them. Refusing might see even more of our country occupied."

romania.59.t:0 "Ukraine is defeated"
romania.59.d:0 "We have successfully liberated the Romanian ancestral lands of Transnistria. The Ukrainian military situation is dire, and we can offer them peace, which they will probably accept.

romania.59.a:0 "Transnistria remains in Ukraine but must be demilitarised."
