### Events ###
unionstate.1.t:0 "Foundation of the Union State"
unionstate.1.d:0 "NEW ORLEANS. Our beloved leader, Huey Long, today addressed the nation, proclaiming the inauguration of a New Union State over America, which will organise the productive and social resources of the nation, end social conflict, maintain peace and order, and eliminate all enemies of the Republic. This bold new initiative shall be headed by..."
unionstate.1.a:0 "Charles Lindbergh - A popular man of the people"
unionstate.1.b:0 "Gerald L. K. Smith will overhaul the economic and political system"
unionstate.1.c:0 "Father Charles Coughlin will promote a paternal corporate state"
unionstate.1.e:0 "William Pelley will root out sedition and enemies of the Republic!"
unionstate.2.t:0 "Where Will We Govern From?"
unionstate.2.d:0 "With the end of the Civil War, we should decide where our capital will be. Will it be moved back to Washington?"
unionstate.2.a:0 "Washington is a corrupt city."
unionstate.2.b:0 "Washington has been cleansed of the Corruption."
unionstate.3.t:0 "Rebirth of the Country"
unionstate.3.d:0 "After the devastation of the American Civil War, Long and the America First Party were hoping to rebuild America stronger than before. The Syndicalist threat was still present around the world and a strong America was needed to meet that threat. Due to the war there was a significant labour shortage and tough decisions would be needed to get the country back on its feet."
unionstate.3.a:0 "Conscript the labour required"
unionstate.3.b:0 "The corporations can handle this"

unionstate.571.t:0 "The American Union State Youth"
unionstate.571.d:0 "William Pelley has submitted a plan to start a Youth Foundation in the AUS and is looking for approval. The Foundation would show Adolescents the purpose of America First and to teach them discipline above all things and loyalty to the New State. We're in need of new recruits, and Pelley's Youth Foundation may be part of the solution."
unionstate.571.a:0 "Let Pelley have his Daycare"
unionstate.571.b:0 "We don't feel comfortable about this..."

unionstate.6.t:0 "The CSA Escapes to France"
unionstate.6.d:0 "Reed and the CSA leadership were forced to flee to the Commune of France to escape the wrath of the victorious American Union State."
unionstate.6.a:0 "He better not return"
unionstate.7.t:0 "Long and the PSA Leadership"
unionstate.7.d:0 "After the end of the civil war, the question of the PSA leadership was put before Long. The insolence of the PSA leadership needed to be punished but it could alienate the west coast and cause further problems. If the PSA leadership was removed, the industry of the west coast would be available but the expertise of the pacific industries would be diminished."
unionstate.7.a:0 "Hang them all"
unionstate.7.b:0 "Amnesty it is"
unionstate.8.t:0 "US Government in Exile"
unionstate.8.d:0 "The victory of America First over the US government has forced them to flee from the country to Canada. The government has vowed to keep on fighting but without a firm power base there is very little chance of making a difference."
unionstate.8.a:0 "Ha."
unionstate.12.t:0 "Long's Tariff"
unionstate.12.d:0 "To encourage the expansion of American industry, Long planned on implementing a hefty tariff on imported goods. He was warned that the tariff may be worse for the economy in the end."
unionstate.12.a:0 "Implement the tariff"
unionstate.12.b:0 "We can do without this"
unionstate.13.t:0 "American Union Recession"
unionstate.13.d:0 "Long's tariff had initially helped build a greater reliance on American industry but it was unsustainable in the long run. The American Union State fell into recession and unemployment began to rise."
unionstate.13.a:0 "Damn."
unionstate.14.t:0 "Show Trials"
unionstate.14.d:0 "American socialism had been defeated and now Long was going to make them pay the price. Socialists, Anarchists, and anyone who had supported the CSA had been subject to prosecution by the American Union State. Minute Men began rounding up members of the left and special tribunals were setup. These were nothing more than show trials that humiliated and lambasted the accused."
unionstate.14.a:0 "Hang them all!"
unionstate.14.b:0 "Exile the bastards"



unionstate.11.t:0 "The Poll Tax"
unionstate.11.d:0 "Long wished to abolish the Poll Tax to reduce the racial tensions of the south. His proposal was met with immediate condemnation by the extremists within his party. Pelley and others denounced Long as trying to destroy the sacred institutions of the South. Long retorted that racist and sacred were two different things and rallied the people against what he saw as an evil institution."
unionstate.11.a:0 "Abolish the damn thing."
unionstate.11.b:0 "No. We need to maintain the party."
unionstate.16.t:0 "The Long Night"
unionstate.16.d:0 "The rift between Long and Pelley had been growing since before the Civil War and with the Civil War over their differences grew more and more. Pelley moved against him. In the dark of night in New Orleans, Pelley and his goons put into place their plot to assassinate Long and wrest power away from Long. Soon enough...."
unionstate.16.a:0 "The Minutemen rush in and arrest Pelley and the Traitors!"
unionstate.16.b:0 "The Minutemen rush and find Long dead!"



unionstate.17.t:0 "The Industrial Security Act"
unionstate.17.d:0 "The Industrial Security Act was Long's answer to the trade unions of the north. The act would make any disruption of essential industries by work stoppages a conspiracy to commit industrial sabotage and would be punishable by imprisonment. The wording on the act was intentionally vague to give the President a highly effective means with which to defeat the unions."
unionstate.17.a:0 "Pass the act"
unionstate.17.b:0 "This is too much"
unionstate.18.t:0 "Industrial Decentralisation Act"
unionstate.18.d:0 "Long had seen the rust belt as being corrupted by the trade unions and socialists. The amount of industry in the rust belt had given the syndicates a large advantage against the former US government and Long wanted to ensure that this did not happen again. A plan was put forward to move the industry from the rust belt into the mid-west and south to defeat the corruption of the Rust Belt and further castrate the trade unions."
unionstate.18.a:0 "Pass the act"
unionstate.18.b:0 "We should avoid this."
unionstate.19.t:0 "Industrial Resources"
unionstate.19.d:0 "The American Union State government has come into possession of resources that were left behind. They will help our government in the future."
unionstate.19.a:0 "Excellent"
unionstate.35.t:0 "New flag for the Republic"
unionstate.35.d:0 "While most of the troops of the American Union State are battling both the old regime and the Combined Syndicates under the eagle banner of the America First Party, some units, especially those raised on the deep south, have been flying their own colours. As this situation has come to the attention of president Long, a special committee was raised to determine a single flag for all the forces of the Republic."
unionstate.35.a:0 "Choose the 'Coast Guard' flag"
unionstate.35.b:0 "Adopt the 'Saltire-and-star'"
unionstate.35.c:0 "'The 'Sword-and-torch' flag"
unionstate.35.e:0 "Keep using the current party banner"
unionstate.36.t:0 "The Long Doctrine"
unionstate.36.d:0 "With the American Union State firmly established, defeating the syndicates in Central and South America was necessary to ensure the security of the new state. A strong position would allow for interventionism against the syndicates before they could successfully secure a position in the Western Hemisphere. Some were concerned that the AUS was spreading itself thin and that internal issues should be addressed first."
unionstate.36.a:0 "Syndicalism must be stopped."
unionstate.36.b:0 "America first."
unionstate.38.t:0 "The Syndicate Threat"
unionstate.38.d:0 "With the fall of Berlin serious questions about the American Union's security were raised. Syndicate domination of Europe was not in the American Union's best interest. Debate as to what action the AUS should take was becoming a major issue. Most were in favour of supporting Germany in its war against the syndicates but an isolationist movement was forming to keep America out of a foreign war."
unionstate.38.a:0 "We should remain neutral"
unionstate.38.b:0 "We need to send support!"
unionstate.38.c:0 "War!"
unionstate.38.e:0 "Join Mitteleuropa!"
unionstate.39.t:0 "The Issue of New England"
unionstate.39.d:0 "The independence of the state of New England had been a contentious issue for the government of the AUS. The reintegration of the state back into the American Union had been made the highest priority and it was unlikely that the government would be deterred by a possible war with the Entente. The stakes were high for the American Union State."
unionstate.39.a:0 "Demand their return"
unionstate.39.b:0 "We should not risk it"
unionstate.40.t:0 "Canada Responds to the AUS Demands"
unionstate.40.d:0 "The alliance between New England and Canada had been one of opportunity but the demand made by the AUS caused strain. The conservatives led by the King were unwilling to alienate Long over New England but others did not wish to abandon New England after what they had been through."
unionstate.40.a:0 "The King is right. We need the AUS"
unionstate.40.b:0 "We must stand by our friends"
unionstate.41.t:0 "New England Stands Alone"
unionstate.41.d:0 "The Entente has abandoned New England to the hands of the AUS. The people of New England have very little hope of overcoming the AUS and the feeling in the state is that they have very little hope."
unionstate.41.a:0 "We have no choice..."
unionstate.41.b:0 "...but to fight!"
unionstate.42.t:0 "New England Accepts Our Demands"
unionstate.42.d:0 "New England has surrendered to our demands and they have been reintegrated into the American Union."
unionstate.42.a:0 "Excellent"
unionstate.43.t:0 "New England Refuses Our Demands"
unionstate.43.d:0 "New England has refused to accept our demands and it is causing a great deal of dissent in the country. The people do not wish another war but it may be inevitable because of how New England has responded."
unionstate.43.a:0 "Outrageous. We will destroy them."
unionstate.43.b:0 "Another war is intolerable."
unionstate.44.t:0 "Entente supports New England!"
unionstate.44.d:0 "The Entente will support New England against the AUS. But, the people of New England feel they still have very little hope of overcoming the AUS and the feeling in the state is that they should surrender anyway."
unionstate.44.a:0 "We have no choice..."
unionstate.44.b:0 "...but to fight!"
unionstate.45.t:0 "New England Stands Alone"
unionstate.45.d:0 "New England stands alone against the AUS and most of the people in New England are unwilling to fight the AUS. Surrender seems inevitable."
unionstate.45.a:0 "We have no choice..."
unionstate.45.b:0 "...but to fight!"
unionstate.46.t:0 "The Long Doctrine"
unionstate.46.d:0 "The new American Union State has proclaimed a policy aimed at extinguishing Syndicalism throughout the Americas. Such a policy is an obvious threat to Mexico."
unionstate.46.a:0 "A new threat arises"
unionstate.47.t:0 "The Long Doctrine"
unionstate.47.d:0 "The new American Union State has proclaimed a policy aimed at extinguishing Syndicalism throughout the Americas. Such a policy is an obvious threat to Brazil."
unionstate.47.a:0 "A new threat arises"
unionstate.48.t:0 "The Long Doctrine"
unionstate.48.d:0 "The new American Union State has proclaimed a policy aimed at extinguishing Syndicalism throughout the Americas. Such a policy is an obvious threat to Centroamérica."
unionstate.48.a:0 "A new threat arises"
unionstate.49.t:0 "The Long Doctrine"
unionstate.49.d:0 "The new American Union State has proclaimed a policy aimed at extinguishing Syndicalism throughout the Americas. Such a policy is an obvious threat to Bolivia."
unionstate.49.a:0 "A new threat arises"
unionstate.50.t:0 "The Pacific Question"
unionstate.50.d:0 "The American Union state had been victorious in the war and now was forced to deal with the PSA. The Pacific states were rich in resources and the government was unfriendly to the AUS so removing that threat was an option but some less radical elements believed that the AUS had been at war enough and that a further war would put unnecessary strain on the delicate hold the government had."
unionstate.50.a:0 "War will end this!"
unionstate.50.b:0 "We should try and coexist with neighbours."
unionstate.51.t:0 "The Mexican Question"
unionstate.51.d:0 "With territory of the former USA under our firm control, time has come to directly implement the Long doctrine and eradicate syndicalism from America. We should start with our southern neighbour - Mexico. The incompetence of the previous governments allowed Syndicalism to root deeply within Mexican society. The only way how to solve this matter is direct military confrontation..."
unionstate.51.a:0 "War will end this!"
unionstate.51.b:0 "We should try and coexist with neighbours."
unionstate.52.t:0 "Aid from the AUS!"
unionstate.52.d:0 "The American Union State, fearing Syndicalist dominance over Europe, decided to support our armed struggle with large amounts of military supplies and volunteers eager to see Syndicalism crushed."
unionstate.52.a:0 "Better than nothing!"
unionstate.53.t:0 "Our place in the sun"
unionstate.53.d:0 "The occupation of American overseas territory by foreign powers during the Civil War was an affront to the Union State. The establishment of Canadian authority over the Panamá Canal Zone, however, was a provocation that could not be overlooked. The victorious government now looked to restore those lands seized by their neighbour to the north."
unionstate.53.a:0 "Demand the return of the canal zone!"
unionstate.53.b:0 "Our concern is elsewhere"
unionstate.54.t:0 "The Demands of the American Union State"
unionstate.54.d:0 "The victorious government of the American Union State has requested we return control of the Panamá Canal back to them."
unionstate.54.a:0 "We must comply"
unionstate.54.b:0 "They'll get over it"
unionstate.55.t:0 "The Return of the Canal Zone"
unionstate.55.d:0 "The Canadians have agreed! Barbecues and hot dogs for everyone!"
unionstate.55.a:0 "American control returns to the Canal"
unionstate.56.t:0 "The Canadians Retain the Canal!"
unionstate.56.d:0 "The Canadians have refused!"
unionstate.56.a:0 "This slight will not go unanswered"
unionstate.56.b:0 "This hubris will be met with arms!"
unionstate.57.t:0 "The Case of Guantanamo Bay Naval Base"
unionstate.57.d:0 "The occupation of American overseas territory by foreign powers during the Civil War was an affront to the American Union State. The establishment of Cuban authority over the Guantanamo bay naval base, however, was a provocation that could not be overlooked. The victorious government now looked to restore those lands seized by their neighbour to the south."
unionstate.57.a:0 "Demand return of the naval base"
unionstate.57.b:0 "Our concern is elsewhere"
unionstate.58.t:0 "The Demands of the American Union State"
unionstate.58.d:0 "The victorious government of the American Union State has requested we return control of the Guantanamo naval bay base back to them."
unionstate.58.a:0 "We must comply"
unionstate.58.b:0 "They'll get over it"
unionstate.59.t:0 "The Cubans Have Complied"

unionstate.62.d:0 "The American Union State has finally established itself as the legitimate successor to the old and corrupt Federal Republic. However, even though America was only saved from Syndicalist tyranny thanks to the prowess of our military, there are some who suggest we need to incorporate those who served on the Federal side in the Civil War. The Kingfish and his party must decide."
unionstate.62.a:0 "Together we shall make America great again!"

TEX_FEDERAL_IFFICIER_CORPS:0 "Old USA leaders will be added to our army."
unionstate.100.t:0 "The New America"
unionstate.100.d:0 "The failure of the plot against Huey Long has allowed him to remove his political rivals and opponents. This has given him a great leeway in reshaping America. A new day is rising in America, and Long's presence is felt everywhere even if it is not seen. America is still a republic and democracy still exists, but the American First Party dominates. The ever fickle American mob is sated by Long's Populism and peace and order has returned to America."
unionstate.100.a:0 "Every man a king!"
unionstate.101.t:0 "Vice President elections"
unionstate.101.d:0 "While power remains with Huey Long, democracy still technically exists and to keep the American mob sated and on his side, Elections have been called to keep the people happy. Various factions are competing for influence and power. The question though is whom shall win the elections?"

unionstate.101.c:0 "Father Caughlin wins with Lindbergh's support"

unionstate.130.t:0 "The New America"
unionstate.130.d:0 "The death of Huey Long swept the American Legion into power lead by William Dudley Pelley. This allowed the extremists within the American First to reshape America to their own desires. And today a new dawn has risen in America. Once located to mainly the south, Jim Crow laws now are the law of the land throughout the country. Christianity has been reinforced as the religion of the people and the country."
unionstate.130.a:0 "God Bless America!"
unionstate.131.t:0 "Vice President elections"
unionstate.131.d:0 "Democracy must remain in America, at least for the right kind of Americans. While we shall make sure that all factions remain loyal to the values of our new America. Elections have been called to keep the people happy. Various factions are competing for influence and power. The question though is whom shall win the elections?"

unionstate.200.d:0 "The American union State has sent us a request to join Mitteleuropa. The industrial might of America would be a great boon to the German Empire, and the Americans have promised to help us do everything they can to destroy syndicalism throughout America. It does help that there many German-Americans in the American Union State government. This alliance would help strengthen the ties between America and Germany, though some wonder if we should ally with such a regime in America."

unionstate.202.t:0 "Canada Holds Alaska"
unionstate.202.d:0 "After the American Union had triumphed in the American Civil War they looked to reclaim the territories that were lost to non-Americans. The Canadians had seized Alaska at the beginning of the war and there was some concern that they did not plan to return it. Long and the leaders of the American Union were considering war with the Entente to reclaim Alaska."

unionstate.207.t:0 "The AUS demand!"
unionstate.207.d:0 "The American Union State has arrived in Honolulu to demand that we surrender to them and join the American Union State. They have arrived with several battleships off the coast of Hawai'i to back up this claim. Many are saying that they rather fight and die for Hawai'i. Of course some politicians are saying that it would be better to save Hawai'ian lives by surrendering"
unionstate.207.a:0 "Never Surrender!"
unionstate.207.b:0 "Surrender!"
unionstate.208.t:0 "The AUS gives up Hawai'i"
unionstate.208.d:0 "While there were numerous concerns that the American Union State would be going to go to war for Hawai'i, an American envoy has arrived saying that the American Union State no longer claims Hawai'i as American territory. We are free from the American Menace."
unionstate.208.a:0 "Great!"
unionstate.209.t:0 "Hawaii refuses!"
unionstate.209.d:0 "The Hawaiians have responded to our demands by saying that they rather risk war then join America. The question is should we go to war for the islands of Hawaii or should we give up and not risk a conflict in the Pacific?"
unionstate.209.a:0 "They shall feel the might of America!"
unionstate.209.b:0 "It is not worth it"
unionstate.210.t:0 "Hawaii gives in!"

unionstate.211.d:0 "The Mexican government is an affront to America. They are a godless syndicalist nation and we can not tolerate such a government on our borders.

unionstate.211.a:0 "Launch the Coup!"
unionstate.212.t:0 "Garza's Coup!"
unionstate.212.d:0 "Pablo González Garza and a number of men have surrounded the Presidential Palace. With aid obviously coming from America he is making a power grab to take control of Mexico and destroy our government. As the dust settles the coup turns out to be..."

unionstate.213.a:0 "Great!"
unionstate.214.t:0 "Treaty with America?"
unionstate.214.d:0 "Now that Garza is in control of Mexico, it would be good to sign a treaty with the American Union State giving us better relations.

unionstate.214.a:0 "Let us join the League of American States"
unionstate.214.b:0 "Let us sign a treaty of friendship"
unionstate.215.t:0 "The Coup Fails!"
unionstate.215.d:0 "Pablo González Garza and his band of traitors have been dealt with. Their plan to destroy the Mexican revolution has been foiled. Now however we must make plans for war. The Americans are not likely to accept the fact that their coup failed lightly and will likely go to war to destroy Mexico."
unionstate.215.a:0 "Bloody Gringos!"
unionstate.216.t:0 "The Coup Fails!"
unionstate.216.d:0 "The coup in Mexico has failed and we now must figure out how to proceed with Mexico. Many are demanding that we declare war on Mexico to restore peace and order and set up Mexico suitable for American business and our interests. A few are saying we should have peace with the Mexicans."
unionstate.216.a:0 "War against the godless Syndicalists!"
unionstate.216.b:0 "War is not needed"
unionstate.217.t:0 "Treaty with America?"
unionstate.217.d:0 "The United states have come with a treaty to improve relations between our two nations.
