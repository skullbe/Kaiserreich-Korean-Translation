### Huey Long Path ###
TEX_new_washington:0 "신 워싱턴"
TEX_new_washington_desc:0 "The new American seat of government will throw off the old shackles of Capitoline tradition and rebuild itself as a defensible and secure location for the three branches to seat power. Boulevards are now too wide for barricades, structures are now supplied with emergency power, and shelters are guaranteed for residents."
TEX_root_out_out_traitors:0 "반역자 색출"
TEX_root_out_out_traitors_desc:0 "Following the trail of convicted traitors, President Huey has found a group of Congressmen that were in contact with business executives planning against us. Although they are now behind bars, some have eluded capture through political avenues. We are investigating whether the captured Richard Butler in his asylum will lead us to any more traitors."
TEX_expand_the_minute_men:0 "미닛맨 확충"
TEX_expand_the_minute_men_desc:0 "In order to preserve the integrity of our armed forces, we must expand the Minutemen into the field of civil protection and border monitoring.

TEX_election_monitoring:0 "선거 감시"
TEX_election_monitoring_desc:0 "The only force that can ensure the democratic process is carried out is the Minutemen, who shall be deployed every November to safeguard voting areas from harm.

TEX_destroy_the_klan:0 "KKK 박멸"
TEX_destroy_the_klan_desc:0 "Hiram Wesley Evans and his cadre of his Grand Wizards are finally arrested and brought to trial for their terroristic actions. Murders, lynchings, and voter intimidation is being brought against this most dangerous group of traitors. With their conviction we have finally pacified the most extreme that sought to poison the American First Party."
TEX_ensure_loyalty:0 "Ensure Loyalty"
TEX_ensure_loyalty_desc:0 "Members of Congress have devised a way to establish a baseline of trust in our democratic system that is sorely needed. The so-named Fish Act would require every party representative, labor union leader and public servant to sign an affidavit stating that they will never aid the CSA or MacArthur junta."
TEX_reward_loyalty:0 "Reward Loyalty"
TEX_reward_loyalty_desc:0 "The Fish Act's critics rightfully stated that there was no incentive for officials to sign the affidavits. In response a second Act is passed to provide compensation for the time spent in the public service during the Civil War that was postponed by the Federalists. This back-pay would require signing the aforementioned affidavit, of course."
TEX_national_political_machine:0 "국가 정당 조직"
TEX_national_political_machine_desc:0 "Executive acts have been used to create agencies to serve the American people in the past, so long as it does not intrude into state sovereignty. In the past, this power has led to corruption from corporate interests. Huey Long is however incorruptible. Turning the tables against the monopolies and grafters is Huey's promise America."
TEX_new_democracy:0 "신 민주주의"
TEX_new_democracy_desc:0 "New Democracy as Huey Long describes it is a new social contract between the American people and leadership. New Democracy promises a politician that will work in his constituents’ interests through adversity, even through violence. Loyalty to your constituents will be rewarded until every man is a king."
TEX_peoples_commission:0 "People's Commission"
TEX_peoples_commission_desc:0 "Inspired by the judicial districts of his home state of Louisiana, Huey Long has created a para-legal representative entity called the Peoples Commission. The Peoples Commission is a nonpartisan forum for public discussion that will allow the AFP to directly communicate with the American people and hear issues that politicians will not report on."
TEX_every_man_a_king:0 "모든 사람이 왕이다"
TEX_every_man_a_king_desc:0 "What began as a dream and lifted from a motivational book by Orison Swett Mardin, Every Man a King is now a political reality. It is positive thinking and the end of pessimistic greed that caused the Great Depression that will save America. Following Huey Long's economic and social plans to transform America and rewrite the political landscape."
TEX_for_the_poor_man:0 "가난한 사람을 위하여"
TEX_for_the_poor_man_desc:0 "Now Huey Long has brought to Congress legislation to furnish a homestead allowance of 1/3rd the average wealth. A guaranteed annual income of $2000 and old-age pensions is ready to be distributed to loyal Americans. Until such a time when the proper income tax changes are made, these benefits are coming out of the National Treasury."
TEX_populist_education:0 "대중을 위한 교육"
TEX_populist_education_desc:0 "Across this great nation there are millions more children struggling to resume normal life and facing a future no better than that of their parents without education. President Long has approved the bill Congress sped through to rebuild schools and reopen colleges for Americans in need."
TEX_road_map_for_the_future:0 "미래를 향한 로드맵"
TEX_road_map_for_the_future_desc:0 "The expenses Huey Long has taken out for Every Man a King requires a fundamentally different means of tax collection and public financing to sustain itself.

TEX_national_youth_adminstration:0 "National Youth Administration"
TEX_national_youth_adminstration_desc:0 "The orphans of the Civil War need not only education to uplift themselves, but discipline as well. A visit to Boys Town near Omaha Nebraska has inspired President Long to create the National Youth Administration. A work training and activism group for young Americans that gives orphans a place to stay and trains them in important life skills."
TEX_share_the_wealth:0 "부를 공유하다"
TEX_share_the_wealth_desc:0 "It has come time for the rich that helped plunge America into civil war to pay. No person will be allowed to accumulate more than 300 times the annual income. Incomes are capped at $1 million, and inheritances capped at $5.1 million. President Long will prove the newspapers who decried him wrong."
TEX_imperial_presidency:0 "제왕적 대통령직"
TEX_imperial_presidency_desc:0 "With traitors uprooted and exposed, public opinion polls show an overwhelming support for President Long's re-election. Unrestrained by pressure to conform or be threatened by members within the AFP, Huey Long has begun what many are calling his 'imperial presidency'. The two-term limit is respectfully discarded until a lesser man is in charge."
TEX_fire_with_fire:0 "이열치열"
TEX_fire_with_fire_desc:0 "The ideological fight against the political and social enemies of America has been done thus far with welfare and incentives.

TEX_perfect_democracy:0 "완벽한 민주주의"
TEX_perfect_democracy_desc:0 "The original Constitution set out to create the perfect union in America. This union failed, America died, but through President Long it was saved. Huey Long and the American people have agreed that the Constitution is now a document to build a more perfect democracy. The uninterrupted will of the American peoples as exerted by its leaders."
### George Van Horn Moseley Path ###
TEX_the_business_plot:0 "The Business Plot"
TEX_the_business_plot_desc:0 "In order to keep the reputation of the War Powers Committee away from the public eye, we have chosen to extend the facade of the 'Arsenal of the Republic' into the new America. The reborn American Republic will return to the fundamental values of our Founding Fathers, and clearly say to the world that America is a Republic, not a Democracy."
TEX_use_the_fbi:0 "FBI 활용"
TEX_use_the_fbi_desc:0 "J. Edgar Hoover understands the needs of the new American Republic to safeguard against syndicalists. Cooperation of the FBI is also popularly received as it signals stability. We can trust the FBI to look in all the wrong places for Huey Long. If J. Edgar ever steps out of line, his relationship with Clyde Tolson will be public knowledge."
TEX_alien_and_sedition_act:0 "New Alien and Sedition Acts"
TEX_alien_and_sedition_act_desc:0 "One of the most important acts of the early American Republic was the Aliens and Sedition Act passed by President John Adams, a wise statesman. We must revive the Act to protect true Americans from syndicalist infiltrators. Firstly, being a danger to public safety or national integrity is now grounds for imprisonment and deportation."
TEX_cointelpro:0 "COINTELPRO"
TEX_cointelpro_desc:0 "The success of the New Aliens and Sedition Act has allowed us to identify several non-political and religious organizations with known syndicalist members. These groups will be monitored under the new COINTELPRO program, a the first fully empowered counterintelligence program capable of monitoring communications between group members."
TEX_purge_dissidents:0 "Purge Dissidents"
TEX_purge_dissidents_desc:0 "Through the Aliens and Sedition Act we have gathered a list of known enemies of the War Powers Committee. They are welfare Longists, anti-progress religious fundamentalists, and mutualists. We are prepared to arrest every ground member and have prepared to export certain as-of-yet untouchable politicians who support these dissidents."
TEX_office_of_policy_coordination:0 "Office of Policy Coordination"
TEX_office_of_policy_coordination_desc:0 "The Office of Policy Coordination, or OPC, was proposed as a means to influence local politics in our favor through agent provocateurs, small scale sanctions, and directly sabotage. The OPC will enable us to softly muscle out radicals and indignant federalists that wish to re-enter the US government on their terms."
TEX_the_black_chamber:0 "The Black Chamber"
TEX_the_black_chamber_desc:0 "Another safety objective is to revitalize the Black Chamber with something Vannevar Bush calls Memex. It is a hypothetical system that would be able to store and transmit microfilm and make information search-able from a station that is connected through telephone wire to other stations. This proposed plan could lead us to a golden age of security."
TEX_american_nationalism:0 "American Nationalism"
TEX_american_nationalism_desc:0 "The American Dream, or Creed, or even Ideal is the often-described glue that holds together our national integrity and prevents civil disturbances. The cascade of failure that was epitomized by Hoover and turned over by Huey Long is now fertile for the American Republic to replant American Nationalism."
TEX_the_american_legion:0 "The American Legion"
TEX_the_american_legion_desc:0 "The end of Huey Long would have ended in disaster if not for the brave veterans of the American Legion. It was the American Legion under Moseley that stood tall when public hysteria grew against syndicalists. It was also the American Legion that convinced Huey Long's Minutemen bodyguards to take that necessary detour."
TEX_nationalize_boy_scouts:0 "Control the Boy Scouts"
TEX_nationalize_boy_scouts_desc:0 "Patriotic youth organizations have existed in Europe for decades. Our own Boy Scouts of America are an untapped well of support for the American Republic to encourage loyalty in Americans subtlety. The War Powers Committee authorizes the appropriation of the Boy Scouts facility to educate and foster true Republicanism."
TEX_fordism:0 "포드주의"
TEX_fordism_desc:0 "Although scientific management was not invented by Henry Ford, it was Ford that proved that measuring time spent on work tasks could lead to faster and more efficient time management. To thank our Committee member Ford, we have granted him the intellectual property over the assembly line method, as well as promoted it in publications."
TEX_american_capitalism1:0 "미국 자본주의"
TEX_american_capitalism1_desc:0 "The American Republic is a capitalist nation, and through the War Powers Committee we can revitalize the age of progress that dissidents and populists intended to destroy. Through our loyal Congressmen, Business Councils will be formed again in the Capitol, taxes will be lowered, and the stock market will be made safe from terrorism."
TEX_capitalist_education:0 "Create the ESMWT"
TEX_capitalist_education_desc:0 "The Engineering, Science, and Management War Training, or ESMWT, is the brainchild of the Department of Commerce to decentralize technological changes. Instead of cooperation that would disrupt competition and give an unfair advantage to certain businesses, this program disburses its findings freely to the public."
TEX_captains_of_industry:0 "Captains of Industry"
TEX_captains_of_industry_desc:0 "Without the noble self-sacrifice of the Captains of Industry, America would have been lost. We should push through Congress a new income tax bracket for those earning more than $10 million dollars annually. With many exceptions designed to give these useful industrialists tax breaks if they are engaged in philanthropy."
TEX_industrial_security_act:0 "Industrial Security Act"
TEX_industrial_security_act_desc:0 "The need for work-site security has never been greater. The average working man is besieged by syndicalist infiltrators, Longist provocateurs, and federalist malcontents. We need to authorize the use of strikebreakers and integrate our loyal American Legionaries into the new National Guard so as to quickly respond to industrial sabotage."
TEX_pass_nira:0 "National Labor Relations Act"
TEX_pass_nira_desc:0 "A permanent solution to the labor crisis has presented itself in the form of then executive order by Moseley to set up a national labor relations bureau. The NLRB will remedy unfair labor practices by both unions and business owners. The impartial wording of the agency has received widespread support from third parties."
TEX_red_scare:0 "붉은 공포"
TEX_red_scare_desc:0 "The FBI has announced that after many months of searching for President Long, he can no longer be presumed alive. The uproar against any socialist groups remaining in America is enormous. The War Powers Committee can barely keep up with all the state laws being passed to stop socialism. Public approval for Moseley is at an all-time high."
TEX_traditional_values:0 "Traditional Values"
TEX_traditional_values_desc:0 "An address by President Moseley has denounced the changes of the last thirty years as the agenda of foreigners that sought to destroy America's industrious nature. The press is divided between those that know Moseley as an antisemitic canard and those who truly believe in the American Republic. Nevertheless, the public loves it."
TEX_republic_without_democracy:0 "Republic without Democracy"
TEX_republic_without_democracy_desc:0 "The American public is now in agreement that Huey Long's true vision of America was that of a Republic without Democracy. Moseley's term has been extended for another four years due to the continued emergency that threatens the American continent. Americanism as the War Powers Committee sees it grows as the term oligarchy loses its stigma."
### Pelley Path ###
TEX_mine_have_seen_the_glory:0 "Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory"
TEX_mine_have_seen_the_glory_desc:0 "It took many Americans by surprise to hear Huey Long's confession of being a syndicalist broadcast that night. The initial backlash could have ended the brief revolution had the Silver Legion faltered. Thankfully, the American Legion and Prohibition Party had deserted Long after his betrayal of his promises. This is the beginning of a new America."
TEX_the_silver_legion:0 "The Silver Legion"
TEX_the_silver_legion_desc:0 "The Silver Legion is currently the unofficial head of the American Legion, with propaganda delivered slowly through agents. This has led to pockets of dissent in some American Legion outposts. We must identify these dissidents and redistribute them to far flung outposts in order to minimize their potential."
TEX_absorb_the_klan:0 "Absorb the Klan"
TEX_absorb_the_klan_desc:0 "Hiram Wesley Evans has been officially inducted into the Silver Legion at a mass Klan gathering in the capital today. His word carries weight in the KKK and will be essential to reel in the Klan. We will also require that Klansmen no longer conceal their faces. In order to use the influence of members to the fullest extent."
TEX_crackdown_on_traitors:0 "Crackdown on Traitors"
TEX_crackdown_on_traitors_desc:0 "A group of stubborn Klansman that refuse to reveal their names have come to Pelley seeking exception. Our Chief Pelley made an enlightened decision to this issue, and has sent the Klansmen into a Secret Service. With a portion of the Klan still undercover, we will be able to seek out and eliminate those with reservations against us."
TEX_covenant_sword_and_arm:0 "The Covenant, Sword, and Arm"
TEX_covenant_sword_and_arm_desc:0 "Members of the Silver Legion in the White Identity Church of Jesus Christ-Christian have reported that many local financial institutions in their area are controlled by syndicalists and foreigners. Since the Legion is overstretched, our Chief Pelley has authorized the Church to appropriate wealth from citizens whether willing or not."
TEX_camps_for_syndies:0 "Criminalise Syndicalism"
TEX_camps_for_syndies_desc:0 "The future of Syndicalism and Longism has been decided. Labor re-education and internment camps are authorized by the shell Congress to house suspected syndicalists indefinitely until the national emergency of the Civil War has truly ended.

TEX_forced_labor:0 "강제 노동"
TEX_forced_labor_desc:0 "The loss of one hundred thousand people from the labor market has angered what used to be loyal Legionaries.

Forced labor for traitors at the service of the corporation that is the Commonwealth."
TEX_jim_crows_america:0 "짐 크로의 미국"
TEX_jim_crows_america_desc:0 "The way of life in the South that the northerner Pelley found, that of segregation and state laws that prevented blacks from exercising civil rights, struck Pelley as the true soul of America. Finally, with total control and the world to gain by acting, Pelley has begun to suggest northern states pass Jim Crow laws of their own."
TEX_protecting_our_race:0 "Revive Nativism"
TEX_protecting_our_race_desc:0 "The foundations of America as Pelley and Armstrong see it are connected not only to the former nation of Britain, but to Anglo Saxons as a race.

TEX_christian_commonwealth:0 "기독교 공동체"
TEX_christian_commonwealth_desc:0 "Pelley's grand vision of the American Commonwealth is a country free of debt and bonds by turning the entire government into a gigantic corporation.

TEX_white_welfare:0 "시민을 위한 공공복지"
TEX_white_welfare_desc:0 "First order is to determine who is a true natural citizen and deserving of stock in the Common-wealth.

TEX_christian_education:0 "Christian Education"
TEX_christian_education_desc:0 "Harvard's Divinity School should have been the gold standard for education since its inception.

Now the public shall know of this danger."
TEX_church_and_state:0 "교회와 국가"
TEX_church_and_state_desc:0 "There are implicit religious values within America that only the Silver Legion can see.

TEX_christian_service_brigade:0 "Christian Service Brigade"
TEX_christian_service_brigade_desc:0 "What began as a volunteer organization for young boys during the Civil War has now become a nationally funded organization, The Christian Service Brigade.

TEX_citzens_council:0 "백인 의회"
TEX_citzens_council_desc:0 "The legacy of civil disobedience that shook the 1930s has stayed with the members of the White Citizens Council.

TEX_christian_work_ethic:0 "Christian Work Ethic"
TEX_christian_work_ethic_desc:0 "With the advent of the Commonwealth, there begins a split in work ethic across the nation that the Silver Legion did not intend.

TEX_america_is_born_again:0 "미국은 다시 태어났다"
TEX_america_is_born_again_desc:0 "Many doubted the ability for the Silver Legion to succeed Huey Long, but those that took the risk are now enjoying the fruits of America's credit system and renewed faith.

This has even led to the AFP ending Dr. Maurice Brodie's polio vaccine research, which we could really have used.

unionstate.57.d:0 "The official records in the United States has always been biased in favor of the ruling party. Once in office, Thomas Jefferson slandered the memory of the great patriot John Adams and fooled subsequent generations into believing that his love for Nativism was tyranny. Now we must erase the great lie perpetrated by presidential candidate and Governor of Ohio Warren G. Harding to hide his black ancestry. We have the papers to prove that beyond a shadow of a doubt that Harding's father was a black man and therefore complicit in a worldwide conspiracy against the Commonwealth."

unionstate.58.t:0 "The Sound and the Fury in theaters"
unionstate.58.d:0 "Today famed author William Faulkner's seminal work The Sound and The Fury releases in theaters to critical acclaim. Most reviewers have praised the exaltation of the Compson family by the prodigal son Jason. In the film Jason sacrifices his hard earned wealth to save his brother Benjy from a lifetime of pain, and saves his family's honor by sending his brother Quentin away to the barren North. Disaster strikes him when his niece Miss Quentin defrauds the family fortune and leaves town. Some critics have commented that the film is facetious and actually highlights the flaws in the Compson family and thus Southern society as a whole. Supporters of this interpretation cite author William Faulkner's liberal leanings, but those reviews were all published by known malcontents. "

unionstate.59.d:0 "The wave of public education changes implemented by Pelley in order to solidify Christian Identity into the America youth is nearly complete. his final act which passed with unanimous approval by the shell of Congress is the Black Education Act. The Black Education Act totally redefines education practices for ethnic minority communities and in particular African-Americans. Notably it focused the education of African-Americans for their role as labors and distances themselves from older notions of religious unity across races. As part of his speech announcing the law, he famously stated, 'There is no place for the Negro in the Anglo Saxon community above the level of laborer. What is the use of teaching the Negro child mathematics when it cannot use it in practice?'. "

unionstate.60.d:0 "One of the more controversial acts that Pelley is proposing is to extend the 1899 Indian Appropriations Act into the African-American community. The proposed Black Belt Act would make communities in the South with majority African-American populations into a reserved space with independent public services. At least on paper the Silver Legion claims these areas will be administered by African-Americans under the regime's jurisdiction, similar to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Moreover the Act would strip citizenship and any previous common-wealth to African-Americans nationwide. However, there comes even from our loyal members murmurs that a whites within the Black Belt would also lose their rights. What shall become of this act?"

unionstate.61.d:0 "The Silver Legion has begun issuing a passbook to African-Americans throughout the Commonwealth in anticipation of the Pass Laws taking effect next year. This law is similar to older internal passport used during the time of the Confederacy to identify freemen and slaves. The Silver Legion strongly discourages any comparisons to past laws and has defended their claims with violence. This has resulted in numerous African-Americans being forbidden from traveling outside of the south with plans to extend zoning into the rest of the Commonwealth. "

unionstate.62.t:0 "The Penal Act"
unionstate.62.d:0 "The Thirteenth Amendment made slavery illegal throughout the country. However, the Amendment allows for involuntary servitude as a punishment for crime. A new order passed by the shell Congress has increased the sentence time for moral crimes and provided for more use of indentured labor in industry, thus being named the Penal Act. This Penal Labor has been given boost by reviving various Black Codes that criminalize attempting to vote as an African-American. The boisterous speeches Pelley delivers on the radio have tried to obfuscate the unfolding truth that slavery is back."

Groups like the International Labor Defense and the NAACP are now working together with the Red Cross to evacuate the masses of people struggling to remain free. To the Silver Legion and their leaders, this plays into a longstanding fear of a united front against their rule. At the same time, the fewer the dissidents internally the safer loyal Legionaries can sleep. The question is what shall we do. Shall we let them leave or shall we keep them here? "

unionstate.64.d.liberia:0 "The thousands that arrived with Marcus Garvey in the early 1930s anticipated that more refugees would come. Even the strongest pessimist could not anticipate the overflow of refugees the Black Star Line has picked up and dropped off in Monrovia. Families are reunited, and the Grain Coast now swells with thousands more Americo Liberians. Those more concerned with food production however have noted that we can't really handle a growing population at this time."
unionstate.64.d.mexico:0 "The existence of American refugees in Mexico has generally been ignored by the Central Government, as we have had amicable relations with America in the past. However, this Pelley is a threat to the entire continent, and the thousands more refugees crossing the Rio Grande tell of the Silver Legion's horrors. These refugees are far different from the Ambrose Bierce's' looking to retire, they are scarred and determined to end the Legionary regime of America. "
unionstate.64.d.haiti:0 "Haiti has always portrayed themselves as the second home for African-Americans. A common story to tell was that the first Haitian was a refugee of Ethiopia that ran with such force that he only stopped when he fell into Haiti. Now we see this again coming out of the USA. The sinister Pelley should not have the right to do this to American people! We feel the refugees outrage, at the same time we struggle to determine whether our fragile economy can handle a labor surplus of this magnitude."
unionstate.64.d.cuba:0 "Just a 300 mile boat trip separated the thousands of American refugees from Cuba. Families in Cuba have been calling for months to their families to escape the very real threat of a nationalist takeover. None of them anticipated that the bottleneck in Florida would be opened all at once, causing hundreds of boats to show up at Varadero today. The flood of refugees from America has clogged up our ports, tied up or landlines, and put strain on the government ministry to respond. What should be our answer?"
unionstate.64.d.hawaii:0 "An incredible amount of the Pacific separated us from the carnage in America, as well as the hand of that monster Pelley. We can only keep such good tabs on the so-called Commonwealth because trade with them is good, and now those trading ships have stowaways. These arrivals tell tales of burning towns and rampant pillaging by the Silver Legion that forced them to evacuate the continent to Hawaii. We may have issues handling the immigration process from a legal standpoint as well, so we must decide the fate of these American passengers. "

Many of those bells were ringing in the ghettoes and reservations by the starving Americans hoping that Pelley's death would bring relief. These hopeful millions were scorned when the Vice Chief Gerald L.K. Smith announced at the funeral that he would serve as Chief in Pelley's stead until his Judgement Day. Despite this show of strength, American expats around the world cheer for the dictator's death and have pressed for condemnation of Chief Smith's continued Silver Legion regime in America."
