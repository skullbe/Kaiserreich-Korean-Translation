BRA_election_year_desc:0 "Tensions rise as vastly different factions prepare for what will probably be the most violent and contentions election in the history of Brazil. Political talk is almost synonym with heated arguments, and an air of ideological extremism looms over the nation's populace."
BRA_decentralization_desc:0 "The United States of Brazil has always prized the autonomy of its states. Each has its own president, its own political parties, and its own military, and the people have shown themselves willing to die for these regional rights. However, this does result in a very weak and toothless central government, which cannot act decisively when required."	
BRA_wake_of_civil_war_desc:0 "Few wounds take longer to heal than a civil war. The War Between the States left thousands dead, and many more orphaned and homeless, as the tensions between the political oligarchies and regional identities finally boiled over to the battlefield after troops from Minas Gerais trespassed into São Paulo. Any actions the central government tries to do are now viewed with immense distrust, and the sheer damage caused on the border between Rio and São Paulo has not yet been fully been repaired"
BRA_fatherland_volunteers_desc:0 "Honouring the legacy of our army in its great history, the Fatherland Volunteers are more than a force raised from common Brazilians, but it is a symbol of their willingness to die for the nation and its freedom"
BRA_forager_idea_desc:0 "Our troops need to have the capacity to strip the land of as much resources as they possibly can, for the logistics of supplying an army in Brazil demand that level of autonomy from our soldiers."
BRA_planningspeed_desc:0 "Our officers are well capable of planning offensives in unison, and to adapt said plan to any occasion; after all, a battleplan seldom survives contact with the enemy."
BRA_we_werent_expecting_special_forces_desc:0 "The special foces of Brazil are a well trained lot, who spent years praticing the art of war to defend their country against foreign invasion. Their numbers and mastery of terrain are certainly a factor to be examined by any would be invader."
BRA_state_armies_desc:0 "Brazil's armed forces are, simply put, a ragtag group of 26 state militias, a so called 'Federal Army' in Rio de Janeiro, and its navy is pretty much the only arm of the military under actual federal chafing. These archaically organized forces have immensily differing quality in both training and equipment, and are simply unsuited to modern combat in any way whatsoever, especially if required to fight for a nation they feel little alleigance to."
BRA_militiagungs_desc:0 "The militas have been properly integrated into the army of the nation as special state guard regiments, organized and equipped in a modern fashion and ready to fight and die for Brazil."
BRA_merchant_marine_desc:0 "Brazil has always been a nation of international trade, for its very name comes from its very fist export, Brazilwood. Our capacity to import goods is an important strategical factor, and expansion of the merchant marine is officially state sponsored."
BRA_patriotism_desc:0 "Our citizens are being slowly accustomed to the notion of a Brazil as an united country, but in time, our efforts to build an united identity will surely take root."
BRA_cangaco_is_over_desc:0 "Banditry between the states is at an all time low, and both rural and urban population feel much safer now that criminals can't just run across state borders to avoid capture."
BRA_higher_learing_desc:0 "A great deal of funding is being diverted to increase the number of people in our country who complete college education. We hope to turn what was once a privilege into something that is accessible by all."
BRA_manter_isso_ai_viu_desc:0 "From public letters of support to shady meetings, we have spared absolutely no measure in ensuring political and economical stability. Politics is a cruel and evil game, but the consequences for losing would be chaos!"
BRA_cheap_cars_desc:0 "Thanks to generous tax breaks, our automotive industry is working with great efficiency and even greater profits, and can supply the state with all manner of vehicles for our needs."
BRA_black_monday_1_desc:0 "Black Monday's devastation upon our economy is on a collosal scale. We can do little but to weather the storm and attempt to make ends meet with our fast diminishing budget..."
BRA_black_monday_2_desc:0 "The new government has taken proper measures to deal with the crisis on our economy, and the worst is over. However, the damage is still done, an open wound on our markets, and further measures must be taken"
BRA_bigger_salaries_desc:0 "The rate of increase in salaries for state officials has been increased officially, as promised during campaign by our president. Naturally, this improves our political situation, even if at a cost."
BRA_it_prints_money_desc:0 "Excessive spending has resulted in what could be the beginning of a significant inflation problem. We should deal this problem immediatly, lest we might suffer immensily under the weight of ever rising prices."
BRA_freedom_of_press_desc:0 "The right for every journalist to report on all matters is a fundamental aspect of freedom, and we will never allow that to be at risk; our anti-censorship legislation is perhaps the most robust in the western hemisphere."
BRA_freedoms_desc:0 "The rights of individuals always come before the needs of the state: The main priority of the government should be to protect their citizens rights, not treating them as tax income reserves to be drained!"
BRA_tax_breakings_desc:0 "Significant tax breaks were given to several strategical sectors, such as plantation owners, as an emergency recovery measure in the fallout of the Black Monday crisis"
BRA_salarys_marlib_desc:0 "Taking a step back and re-evualutating public salaries, we have set their raises at a much more reasonable rate, giving the budget some grealy needed breathing room."
BRA_marlib_loans_desc:0 "Intense and extensive fiscal reforms have greatly improved the budgetary situation of both the government and federal units such states."
BRA_am_i_being_detained_desc:0 "Our laws have been always the cornerstone of our freedoms, and in these troubled times it is no different. We must always take the freedoms of the people above all else."
BRA_good_natives_desc:0 "The first Brazilians are protected under harsh, but fair laws, and if they wish to live in isolation from the rest of the Empire, it's well within their rights to do so. Who are we to taint their noble and pure lifestyle?"
BRA_advisory_parliament_desc:0 "The parliament now has a simple advisory role, and the word of the monarch is final and absolute, the way it was always meant to be."
BRA_anmon_gang_desc:0 "The powers of the so called states, little more than tools of the republicans to dismantle Brazil, have been properly dealt with. Brazil is one step closer to a government that works for its people."
BRA_are_you_threatening_me_master_jedi_desc:0 "A truly organic and decentralized state, properly representing the will of the people, is now a reality, as each city has more freedom than a syndicalist slave could conceive. God has truly blessed our Empire."
BRA_blueguard_desc:0 "The Imperial Blueguardsa are more than resourceful and loyal; they are the first line of defense against both foreign spies and syndicalist lies. "
BRA_krush_desc:0 "We have restored both the traditions and the funding of the army's cavalry corps, and now these mighty defenders of the empire have the training and equipment they always deserved."
BRA_stubborness_desc:0 "Our Empire will never fall to the dark forces that oppose us, no matter how high the cost!"
BRA_the_romena_desc:0 "A new constitution is in effect in Brazil, and is the legal basis of the New State. Pejoratively called the 'Romanian' by its opponents due to its authoritarian leanings, it's in fact far less radical that anything the Iron Guard could come up with, but is still a brazen attempt by the New State to seize utter control of the country nonetheless, with open margin for critics to be arrested for 'treason'."
BRA_voz_do_brasil_desc:0 "Na Guanabara, dezenove horas"
BRA_estado_novo_youth_desc:0 "The youth of our new state is more than ready to deal with Syndicalists and other rabble that constantly seek to sabotage Brazil's prosperity."
BRA_populsit_education_desc:0 "Since their youngest days, the new generation of Brazilians will know that the Father of the Poor saved the country from utter ruin and brought it back to greatness."
BRA_CLT_Vargas_desc:0 "The New State has always had the interest of the workers at heart, and few can claim that the new charter of worker's rights is not both fair and well overdue."
BRA_unlimited_powa_desc:0 "The New State has achieved perhaps the greatest degree of centralization any state ever had in South American history. Vargas' personal directives may as well be laws in this new era."
BRA_anarcho_hueism_desc:0 "Brazil's unique history and culture means we can't just apply ideas thought for France and Britain, nor that we should be so rigid reading ownership of private property. Ideological orthodoxy can't get in the way of Brazilian progress!"
BRA_shrukie_state_desc:0 "While certainly a difficult process, we are spending a great deal of effort diminishing the impact of the apparatus of state on people's lives."
BRA_mst_desc:0 "Farmland has largely been redistributed to local cooperatives both owned and operated by those who toil on the land. Individuals, however, are still allowed to possess the value that they add to the land."
BRA_women_homefront_desc:0 "We must ensure that, in the event of wartime, the entire population of Brazil is ready to do its part, on and off the battlefields."
BRA_radsoc_literay_desc:0 "Grand strikes are being taken in the herculean effort that is to ensure that every Brazilian, no matter where he lives, knows how to read and write."
BRA_christian_socialism_desc:0 "Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money."
BRA_radsoc_literay2_desc:0 "Grand strikes are being taken in the herculean effort that is to ensure that every Brazilian, no matter where he lives, knows how to read and write."
BRA_people_militias_desc:0 "The people's militias are the descendants of the state miltias of the previous republic, and deal with both law enforcement and garrisoning activities"
BRA_guns_desc:0 "The best defence against tyranny is to ensure that the people can arm themselves, as we are doing right now."
BRA_nomnom_desc:0 "Erradicating hunger will not be by any measure something we can achieve in a few years. But we are doing immense strides towards that goal, and we may in a few short decades ensure that not a single Brazilian, no matter where he hails from, spends a day of his life wanting for food."
BRA_kids_learn_materialism_desc:0 "Educating the people properly is perhaps the most imprtant task of our state, especially the children, who must be taught from birth the values of Syndicalism"
BRA_cs_union_desc:0 "The Congress of Trade Unions is the new legislative body of the Union of Brazil, a shining example of worker's democracy for the world to see"
BRA_cs_main_legistaltive_desc:0 "The Congress of Trade Unions is the new legislative body of the Union of Brazil, a shining example of worker's democracy for the world to see"
BRA_cs_local_aswell_desc:0 "The Congress of Trade Unions is the new legislative body of the Union of Brazil, a shining example of worker's democracy for the world to see"
BRA_adults_learn_materialism_desc:0 "Our grand educational reforms now reach every level of teaching, with a new generation of intellectuals fast rising to bring us to the future"
BRA_cs_powerful_desc:0 "The Congress of Trade Unions is the new legislative body of the Union of Brazil, a shining example of worker's democracy for the world to see"
BRA_washy_washy_desc:0 "The romantization of poverty and living in abjectly unhygienic places is a disgusting pratice. The personal wishes of individuals most not take precedence to the needs of society, especially in matters of public health"
BRA_shining_syndies_desc:0 "The Union of Brazil is the example of what a Syndicalist state should aspire to be. The chains were broken, replaced with books and bread, as the entire nation now lives an unprecedented era of peace and stability"
BRA_pray_or_gulash_desc:0 "Our clergy now fully support our new regime, for they know the alternative is to risk the souls of the people."
BRA_helpful_spies_desc:0 "Without any alliegances or ties in the country, these foreign spies are perfect for the cold and necessary work of military intelligence. Worker's solidarity does come in many forms..."
BRA_dops_desc:0 "The Departament of Political and Social order makes the rounds in universities and other hotbeds of counterrevolutionary unrest, always ready to defend our grand principles "
BRA_pravda_desc:0 "So much of the state press is propaganda now, that few can even be sure of what is news and what is pamphleteering."
BRA_thats_racist_desc:0 "Brazil now has the most robust anti-racism legislation on the world, and spouting a slur against a fellow citizen is not something tolerable. We are all equal under God and Emperor, and to think otherwise is treason!"
BRA_the_red_army_desc:0 "The Army of the Union of Brazil has been reformed and reorganized into the pinnacle of the will of he workers for a better future: The Red Army."
BRA_industrialist_soft_approach_desc:0 "We are taking a soft approach towards the powerful industrial barons of the country"
BRA_industrialist_harsh_approach_desc:0 "We are taking a harsh approach towards the powerful industrial barons of the country"
BRA_in_revolt_desc:0 ""
BRA_american_refugees_desc:0 "As chaos and trumoil engulf the United States of America, many of its citizens come to Brazil in search of a better and safer life."

##Focuses 
BRA_archipelago:0 "Bridging the Brazilian Archipelago"
BRA_archipelago_desc:0 "To many of our military analysts and theorists, Brazil is akin to an Archipelago, with cities and major centres beings its islands. The vast, inaccessible unknown of nation can greatly hinder our reaction speed to an invasion, but also may come to save it from invasion in the near future. What we need is not to complain about the cards we got, but learn a way to know what to do with them; establish a series of radio stations, for our army can always be ready act at a moment's notice!"
BRA_general_staff:0 "General Staff"
BRA_general_staff_desc:0 "For decades our military has been fractured among cliques and factions, weak and ineffectual. We need to bring them closer, into one, singular general staff where the defence of the homeland can be properly planned."
BRA_logistics_battalions:0 "Logistic Battalions"
BRA_logistics_battalions_desc:0 "An army is made of more than just guns and uniforms. Medics, engineers, officers and scouts are of vital importance, but their effectiveness is hindered by our sheer lack of equipment."
BRA_scouts_trackers:0 "Scouts and Trackers"
BRA_scouts_trackers_desc:0 "The treacherous terrain of our home is a blessing and a curse for our army planners; it is not that uncommon for our own forces need proper guidance from locals to navigate the lands. However, by establishing proper scouting and planning procedures, we can ensure that we always have the edge. "
BRA_doctrine_mass:0 "Mass Assault"
BRA_doctrine_mass_desc:0 "Brazil may not have the most advanced equipment, or the best trained troops, but there is one thing we do have: A people that is not afraid to fight and die for their country! Our neighbours' small forces will not be able to confront the will of the people of Brazil."
BRA_not_one_step_back:0 "Not One Step Back"
BRA_not_one_step_back_desc:0 "Brazil will endure! Not one man will allow himself to be conquered by fear of the enemy, for our nation is built on the courage of every citizen and soldier. Cowards and deserters will gain something to fear, that is for sure!"
BRA_fatherland_volunteers:0 "Fatherland Volunteers"
BRA_fatherland_volunteers_desc:0 "Honouring the legacy of our army in its great history, the Fatherland Volunteers are more than a force raised from common Brazilians, but it is a symbol of their willingness to die for the nation and its freedom."
BRA_forager_squads:0 "Forager Squads"
BRA_forager_squads_desc:0 "When you lead a grand army, supplies are always a colossal issue. In order to aid in that endeavour, scouts and forager battalions will be trained specifically to gather food, in addition to some survival training to our troops so they can feed off the land."
BRA_grand_battleplan:0 "Grand Battleplan"
BRA_grand_battleplan_desc:0 "Preparation is the key to success, in war and in life. If we truly are to keep our position as South America's greatest and wealthiest nation, we must prepare for war, wherever it may come from."
BRA_exercises_large:0 "Large Scale Exercises"
BRA_exercises_large_desc:0 "He who desires peace should prepare for war; and these preparations should be of the proper size and scale that our nation's defence demands."
BRA_plano_infalivel_n1936:0 "Planning Staff"
BRA_plano_infalivel_n1936_desc:0 "Our general staff will now have a hand in preparing every major operation our troops perform on the field. While some critize this as an overcentralizing move that could potentially diminish operational autonomy, we cannot simply assume every officer knows his Grand Strategy."
BRA_macro_battlelines:0 "Strategical Battlelines"
BRA_macro_battlelines_desc:0 "The age of pitched battles is long gone; now, operations occur on a strategical level, with fronts going for hundreds of kilometers as the battlelines of war extend themselves. We must ensure that our generals can think and plan in such a scale."
BRA_united_brazilian_army:0 "Unite the Army"
BRA_united_brazilian_army_desc:0 "Our army has traditionally been more decentralized than even the state itself, with local regiments and militias operating in a nearly independent fashion from each other. The civil war broke almost any semblance of federal authority over the army, and now our forces are truly a mess of commanders and officers. Serious steps must be taken to overcome this, no matter the political cost."
BRA_southern_strongholds:0 "Southern Strongholds"
BRA_southern_strongholds_desc:0 "If all else fails, and one of our lines break, our defensive planners have a contingency. By fortifying the São Paulo and the outlying hills and areas, we can establish a perimeter around Rio and the coastline, and using the São Francisco river as the northern, natural part of the line, we can ensure that we are not caught unprepared in case initial engagements fail against a certain unnamed radical regime to the South."
BRA_techslot:0 "Military Science"
BRA_techslot_desc:0 "Tanks, submarines, planes, radar; the battlefield is ever changing, especially in the interesting times we live in. We must ensure that our military not only gets up to date equipment, but also that our generals and admirals can keep up with this age of ever changing warfare."
BRA_adapt_militias_into_hieracy:0 "Adapt State Militias into Hierarchy"
BRA_adapt_militias_into_hieracy_desc:0 "Hile heterogenous in efficiency, our militias have the same rankings and order of battle as the regular army does. Direct integration is possible and desirable, but we have to remember many still dont trust the Federal Government and such a move may be unpopular."
BRA_joint_planning_staff:0 "Joint Staff"
BRA_joint_planning_staff_desc:0 "Centralizing the very top of the military hierarchy should be our utmost priority in our task to unify our armed forces. This will no doubt be a complicated process, but it's a necessary one."
BRA_joint_exercises:0 "Joint Exercises"
BRA_joint_exercises_desc:0 "Not only military exercises are not common, but they also most often feature just a few members of a given state militia praticing a mock war agaisnt their fellow Brazilians. To create a sense of unity, these exercises must be reorganized to more productive and realistic outcomes."
BRA_federal_intervention_corps:0 "Federal Intervention Corps"
BRA_federal_intervention_corps_desc:0 "The forces of the federal government nomially don't exist, but this could be used to justify the creation of an elite force, the Federal Intervention Corps, as a national guard doubling as special forces. Naturally, we'll need to hand pick soldiers from every state for this endeavour."
BRA_selva_forces:0 "Jungle Warfare"
BRA_selva_forces_desc:0 "The vast jungle that runs through most of our coastline has massive military implications. Its mountainous terrain is too rugged and forested for usual land combat to occur. We must train special units to properly garrison and for effective counter operations if need be."
BRA_federal_army:0 "The Federal Army"
BRA_federal_army_desc:0 "The armies of states should be abolished formally, and as soon as possible; they are nothing but a scar reminding us of troubled and uncertain times."
BRA_modern_army_corps_organization:0 "Modern Army Corps Organization"

BRA_regionalist_recruiting_tactics_desc:0 "In a country as large as ours, convincing folks to fight for far away lands can always be complex, especially for those to whom cities are an abstract context.

BRA_afro_religions:0 "Safeguard African Culture"
BRA_afro_religions_desc:0 "The African people of Brazil have long been ignored by the republic; an unsurprising fact, considering how it was founded and maintained by former slave owners, who resented the monarchy for ending the cruel practice.

bra.1.d:0 "Brazil's neutrality in the Weltkireg kept the country at peace and with stability until the economical collapse following the crisis in it's main trade partners after the British Revolution. The period of trumoil came to a head as the balance at play was put in jeopardy after both São Paulo and Minas Gerais each launched their own candidates for the 1926 elections. The stage was set for a major crisis, and thus began the Interstate War, also referred to as the Civil War.  São Paulo had widespread support in its war against the federal government; especially important was that of the northern and eastern state governors led by João Pessoa, and the Rio Grande do Sul state, whose historical borderland status meant it possessed a disproportionately strong military. This support, coupled with its manufacturing and monetary advantages and the mutiny of the federal navy, resulted in the war ending in a victory for the rebels, and Fernando de Melo resigning in favour of Borges de Medeiros, who briefly ruled over the republic and transitioned into the current constitution.  Ever since, the republic has transformed in many ways, especially economically, and has prospered in many ways.c as two presidents in a row were democratically elected. However as the 1936 elections approach, political radicalism rises as Syndicalists, Anarchists and Integralists continue to engage in street fights and rethoric from politicians becomes more divisive and agressive"

Said frequent comparisons have drawn the ire of the German embassator to Brazil, as he claims they are 'slanderous claims on governor Goering's upstanding character'.

He announced his intentions to run for president officially earlier today in Porto Alegre, to a roaring crowd of citizens who wish for the republic to finally achieve stability, and are tired of opportunists attempting to decieve them.

While their meeting was publically regarding donations to poor neighbourhoods in cities near Rio, the fact is that they are likely maling plans for an eventual Integralist electoral victory. Integralism in Brazil is highly influenced by Portugal, even if being an openly monarchist party is technically illegal, and thus the meeting stirred up much controversy, for it is proof for many of the AIB's true alliegance.

Said participation and commitment to racial equality is represented by their former candidate to the presidency, and current VP nominee Arlindo Veiga dos Santos, a deeply monarchist intellectual who denounces the leaders of the republic as former slave lords, who just mask themselves under new guises. However, the presidency candidate, Gustavo Dodt Barroso, is far more hostile and has not been shy in demostrating his anti-semitism, claming the capitalist classes of Brazil are puppets of the Elders of Zion.

bra.16.d:0 "The Democratic Left is very much a broad front, formed by people that range from former Republicans, frustrated with the lack of aid to the common people, to syndicalists who seek to gain power via democratic methods. This big tent organization of the party made choosing a presidential candidate difficult, even if it wasn't a particularly contentious process. João Mangabeira is probably more well known for being the left wing brother of president Mangabeira than his own career, but this recognition may very well be his greatest asset in what is probably going to be a complicated electoral process. The nomination is just the begninng of his journey, for he needs to properly build a left front with several factions, such as with unions and the FAB"

Perhaps the most well organized and influential leftist organization in the country, it's natural that João Mangabeira and his allies in the Left Front have spared little time in bringing them under the ED umbrella. While many in the CGT have their reservations on working with someone who is clearly less radical than themselves, the idea of peaceful transition to a worker's government has grown in some circles, especially after the violent repression of several strikes recently "

The FAB is, unsurprisingly for an Anarchist organization, very decentralized, and the meeting was mostly on topics of worker's rights and payments, rather than formal coalition talks.

Naturally, it's an exaggeration, but the effect of this red scare was significant enough for Mangabeira to publically say that he, in fact, is not a Syndicalist in any way, and mention that European Syndicalism is 'not an example to be followed', citing the civil war in Italy as a warning to the consequences of extremism.

Today, an unkown person in Chilean politics, Mr. Labarca, visited the Catete and was welcomed by president Mangabeira, something that caused nothing less than a panic in the nation. The idea of a known syndicalist radical meeting with the president is seen as both absurd and borderline treason, and many military offiers, and the press, issued statements that more read like ultimatums to our government than anything. If we fold to their demands, we will be arresting an innocent man and falling out of favour with any leftists in our nation and abroad; the opposite is true if we do not, but the danger of civil war looms on the horizon.

Many local syndicalists already were based in Rio for political reasons, but the decision on how Brazil will head towards socialism is now up in the air, to be decided by the first congress of trade unions. Three main ideological factions arose in the small time we had to ponder and debate. The Orthodx Syndicalists are, as the name suggest, the ones that are attuned to foreign intellectuals and European syndicalism, while the Autonomists see the European governments as exessively large and centralized, and claim that Brazil is simply too large and varied to be administrated in such a way. The third faction, the Maximalists, are a minority by a large margin, but their loud cries for action and strong leadership resonate with some leaders. No matter who walks off this first congress in power, this choice is an irreversible one for the path that our nation must take in following decades, and thus many debates are being held, even as forces outside the state seek to push for counterrevolution."

But now, after a brief stint returning as the syndical leader of the very influention union of artists, she has announced her intention to run for the post of chairman, and enjoys the support of the vast majority of modernists. Her daring attitude and long history of struggle made her famous both in Rio and other cities, and such a well known public figure is likely to have to spend little effort in making herself known.

Now, he seeks to ensure the safety of the nation and his great popularity; while it's unlikely that he will outlive chairman Abilio, he certainly seems to be his current heir apparent."

Known for his modernist and innovative style, the author has frequently gone against the current of 'well organized' poetry, especially in recent years. Having arrived back in Brazil after years in Europe at the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, his work gradually became more heterodox in each book, with subjects of poems often mixing comedic, deathly or even vulgar tones, and this drift towards modernism is very well shown in his most recent book.
