BRA_last_line_desc:0 "If all else fails, and one of our lines break, our defensive planners have a contingency.

BRA_iguacu_line_desc:0 "Even with the Iguaçu River protecting it, the border between the State of São Paulo and La Plata could well be used as a point of breakthrough to encircle the bulk of our army in Rio Grande do Sul.

BRA_amphibious:0 "Amphibious Operations: War Plan Ciano"
BRA_amphibious_desc: "La Plata knows we are coming, and no doubt has increased defences at the border and in a direct path to Buenos Aires.

BRA_jungle_army:0 "Atlantic Jungle Training"
BRA_jungle_army_desc:0 "The vast jungle that runs through most of our coastline has massive military implications. Its mountainous terrain is too rugged and forested for usual land combat to occur. We must train special units to properly garrison and for effective counter operations if need be"
BRA_rubber_army:0 "The Rubber Army"
BRA_rubber_army_desc:0 "Many in Brazil need jobs. Many in Brazil wish only the best for our country.

BRA_nuke_desc:0 "Nuclear power, in useful amounts, would be incredibly hard to amass.

BRA_syndie_amnesty_desc:0 "Capitalism was built on the shoulders of the workers. Many were simply too scared or too week to rise against their masters.

BRA_national_guard:0 "Establish a new National Guard!"
BRA_national_guard_desc:0 "The coup attempts and civil unrest make it clear that words alone will not keep the republic safe. Establishing and maintaining a national guard will be mostly symbolic, but will be a useful way to incorporate militia members into our order of battle"
BRA_rule_of_law:0 "Rule of Law Prevails"

bra.1.t:0 "The Political Situation"
bra.1.d:0 "Brazil's fragile First Republic has been on the brink of its end since her humiliating defeat by Argentina on last year's war. The apparent stability represented by the 'Café com Leite' doctrine - the dominance of Brazilian politics by the landed oligarchies of São Paulo and Minas Gerais - is revealing itself a farce, as general dissent against the federal government becomes more and more apparent. Old rivalries between different sectors of society are awaken. Dissatisfaction by the local elites of the South and Northeast against the government in Rio, and also by the industrialists in São Paulo, is growing. The 'cangaço' bandits, led by figures like Lampião and Corisco, are running rampant and harassing farmers in Ceará, Bahia and Pernambuco. The Brazilian Workers Confederation, an umbrella organisation for the syndicalist movement, is sponsoring heavy labour strikes in the South-Southeast. Meanwhile, populist and nationalist thoughts are growing among the army and the middle class. Not even the armed forces can be trusted anymore: the 'Tenentes', the nonpartisan junior officers who organised the mutinies among the Army during the final stages of the war, can - and will - be mobilised by any side of the political spectrum. Emergency elections have been called for August, and some say that only a miracle can save democracy in Brazil."
bra.1.a:0 "Let us wait until August, then."
bra.2.t:0 "Padre Cícero passes away."
bra.2.d:0 "This morning, father Cícero Romão Batista, died peacefully during his sleep at the old age of 92. The local leader, revered as a saint by the peasantry of the north-eastern states, was seen as an éminence grise by the political class in Ceará, acting as a neutral mediating party on disputes between the Coronéis, the landed oligarchs of the northeast."
bra.2.a:0 "His charisma will be missed."
bra.3.t:0 "The Brazilian Communist Party dissolves itself"
bra.3.d:0 "This morning, the small city of Cruzeiro, São Paulo, was visited by the remaining leaders of the Brazilian Communist Party (PCB, Partido Comunista Brasileiro) as they organised their clandestine IV Party Congress. Founded in 1922 and much present on the very early days of the labour movement, the PCB is now a shadow of its former self, as a great part of its leaders and members have moved to other movements and parties, such as the Workers and Peasants Bloc (BOC, Bloco Operário e Camponês), the Brazilian Workers' Confederation (CBT, Confederação Brasileira dos Trabalhadores) and the Socialist Revolutionary Party (PSR, Partido Socialista Revolucionário). The strict adherence to the old Soviet Bolshevist doctrine by the party inner circle is seen by most as the main reason for its failure. With this in mind, the rump party voted by a great majority to dissolve itself and be absorbed by the CBT. A small part of the old guard, however, led by Octávio Brandão, is keeping an eye on the developments of the Totalist ideas in Britain, and have already announced that the Party may be re-founded on the near future."
bra.3.a:0 "Okay."
bra.4.t:0 "Major industrial strike in São Paulo"
bra.4.d:0 "Today the Brazilian Workers Confederation, led by Astrogildo Pereira, announced a major strike in São Paulo. All the industry has stopped producing as most of the city's workers have joined the movement. The picketers are demanding a complete review of the labour laws, instituting a common minimal wage for all states and other workers' rights. The organisation is willing to negotiate starting now."
bra.4.a:0 "Cave in to their demands."
bra.4.b:0 "We will not negotiate with them unless they stop their strike."
bra.4.c:0 "They are simply bandits, send in the police."
bra.5.t:0 "CBT strike in São Paulo continues"
bra.5.d:0 "The main industrial hub of the country is still on a complete halt as the Brazilian Workers Confederation maintains their picketing. The movement now is threatening to spread west to Rio de Janeiro, as the local CBT chapter led by Minervino de Oliveira has already announced their intent to join in. Some in the government say that we can't be held ransom by syndicalist scum and recommend a heavy police action."
bra.5.a:0 "We can't risk an escalation, negotiate with the syndicates."
bra.5.b:0 "Send in the police, the army and everything we have!"
bra.elections.1.t:0 "Brazilian Presidential Election, 1936"
bra.elections.1.desc:0 "Due to the unstable political situation in our country, especially after our defeat on the Platine War, emergency elections have been called for the 1st of August. Four main coalitions are disputing: first, we have the Aliança Nacional Libertadora (ANL, National Liberation Alliance), a broad front for the left-wing parties, composed of the Socialist Revolutionary Party and the political sides of the BOC and CBT syndicates. Next, we have the Liberal-Democrats (Liberal-Democratas), an ad-hoc coalition of centre-left and liberal forces under former president Júlio Prestes, politically-experienced and presenting themselves as a moderate alternative to the present situation. Further to the right we have the Republicans (Republicanos), a union of conservative parties, joining landowners and industrial capitalists with the right-wing forces of the military under the leadership of populist Getúlio Vargas. The fourth main coalition are the authoritarian Brazilian Integralist Action (AIB, Ação Integralista Brasileira), the nationalist and populist party under Plínio Salgado. After a very passionate campaign, the elections took place today. As the votes were counted, the next President of Brazil was announced..."

bra.elections.2.t:0 "Edgard Leuenroth inaugurated as President"
bra.elections.2.d:0 "Despite all of the setbacks we have suffered on the previous years, the Aliança Nacional Libertadora grand coalition has managed to elect Edgard Frederico Leuenroth, of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, as the next president of Brazil. The fifty-five-year-old journalist and long-time anarchist was one of the organisers of the general strikes in São Paulo in 1917-1919, helping establish the anarcho-syndicalist movement in the country. He was seen, thus, by the ANL leadership, as their obvious candidate for the presidency. And today is his inauguration day! Despite what some purists think, we may be forced to work on a coalition with some left-wing elements of Liberal-Democrats to appease some parts of the middle classes. A much more palatable solution for us would be asking the left-wing Tenentes into our coalition. Others, however, still think we can handle the whole government all by ourselves."
bra.elections.2.a:0 "Ask for support from the Liberal-Democratas."
bra.elections.2.b:0 "Invite the left-wing Tenentes into the ANL."
bra.elections.2.c:0 "The syndicalist movement needs no alliances."
bra.elections.3.t:0 "The new Chief Minister"
bra.elections.3.d:0 "At least until we enact a new constitution, the President of Brazil acts as Head of State, although real power must be shared with his Chief Minister of the Presidency (Ministro-Chefe da Casa Civil). He is responsible for assisting the President, overseeing all cabinet requests and bureaucratic procedures involving the Presidency, and is also responsible for negotiations with the state governments, with both houses of the Congress and with the remaining Ministers. All the three main parties of the ANL have put forward their own candidates for the post. Lívio Xavier of the BOC, Astrogildo Pereira of the CBT, and João da Costa Pimenta of the PSR. So, who shall we choose?"

bra.elections.4.t:0 "Júlio Prestes returns to the presidency"
bra.elections.4.d:0 "We were assured that the Brazilian people still believes on democracy. Júlio Prestes, president from 1930 to 1934, will return to office. Despite all the mess which has been brought to the country by the incompetence of the present government and by extremists from the right and left, the very institutions upon which the Federative Republic has been laid down were not shaken. And we know democracy is all about negotiating and laying alliances, right? Some parts of our bloc believe in asking the centre-left elements of the military into our coalition, which will appease the armed forces. Others, however, think that inviting Getúlio Vargas and his Republicans would calm down the landowners and other conservative forces. So, what shall we choose?"
bra.elections.4.a:0 "Form a coalition government with the centre-left Tenentes."
bra.elections.4.b:0 "Invite Getúlio!"
bra.elections.4.c:0 "Our coalition needs no alliances."
bra.elections.5.t:0 "The next Chief Minister"
bra.elections.5.d:0 "Although the President of Brazil acts as Head of State, real power must be shared with his Chief Minister of the Presidency (Ministro-Chefe da Casa Civil). He is responsible for assisting the President, overseeing all cabinet requests and bureaucratic procedures involving the Presidency, and is also responsible for negotiations with the state governments, with both houses of the Congress and with the remaining Ministers. Our bloc has put forward three different candidates for the post. Washington Luís, president from 1926 to 1930, supported Júlio Prestes both on his 1930 campaign and on this year, so he would be a most likely choice. Two other candidates must also be considered, however: former Piauí governor Olímpio de Melo and Borges de Medeiros, the traditional gaúcho politician. Choosing a chief of staff from a smaller state, instead of the paulista Washington Luís, would grant us a greater support base among the traditionalist classes, although we will miss the former president's political expertise."

bra.elections.5.c:0 "Borges de Medeiros"
bra.elections.6.t:0 "Getúlio Vargas assumes the presidency"
bra.elections.6.d:0 "Tradition has scored a victory. The people of Brazil has chosen Getúlio Vargas of the Republican bloc as the new president. Coming from a traditional rancher family of the southern Pampas, Vargas was seen by his coalition as a compromise candidate, appeasing the landowners from the South, Southeast and Northeast, the industrial bourgeoisie and, thanks to him states' rights platform, the whole range of conservative forces. Plus, his populist speeches also seduced a portion of the proletariat, thanks to his promises of new labour laws and a more efficient social security system. Now, for a even more effective governing of Brazil, we must consider some political alliances with the other voting blocs. Should Vargas attempt a deal with the right-wing Tenentes led by Eurico Gaspar Dutra, his old friend from his time on the army? Some, however, are dreaming about a coalition with the nationalist Ação Integralista Brasileira. Despite the obvious differences between the pro-states' rights Republicanos and the authoritarian AIB, some of their policies are perfectly compatible with ours. Plus, this would mean a greater support from the middle classes."
bra.elections.6.a:0 "Invite the right-wing Tenentistas under Dutra."
bra.elections.6.b:0 "Try a deal with Plínio Salgado's Integralists."
bra.elections.6.c:0 "Do nothing - We can run everything by ourselves."

He is responsible for assisting the President, overseeing all cabinet requests and bureaucratic procedures involving the Presidency, and is also responsible for negotiations with the state governments, with the ministers and with both houses of the Congress. Our bloc has put forward three different candidates for the post. Former governor of São Paulo, Altino Arantes, would surely appease the industrialist classes and the coffee breeders of the state. Another good choice would be Eurico Gaspar Dutra, Vargas old friend from the army and one of the few successful leaders of the war against Argentina. Finally, if we want to please the oligarchs from the Northeast, Paraíba governor João Pessoa would be the ideal candidate."

We are also fed up of harassing by the syndicalist bandits! This decadent and unpopular government will be rebuilt from scratch according to our ideology. However, it would be wise to form a coalition government with like-minded politicians... Inviting the more far-right elements of the armed forces would be a nice move, according to some. Others, however, believe in striking a deal with Getúlio Vargas' Republicans - their populist ideas actually match several points of our own agenda!"

#bra.6.t:0 "Berlin crisis is approaching Brazil"
#bra.6.d:0 "Brazil was hit hard by the Berlin Stock Market Crash, as the country has a heavy dependence on foreign markets and loans. Despite the industrial development in São Paulo, the export of coffee and other primary products is still the mainstay of the economy. Days after the Berlin stock market crash, coffee quotations immediately fell 30 percent. Now, while we still are the government of Brazil, we must take a decision. Sticking to the principles preached by the foreign bankers may preserve our economy from some of the worse effects of the crisis, but will anger the people even more. However, suspending the convertibility of the Real and the Papiermark would be disastrous for our economy and foreign trade."
#bra.7.t:0 "Effects of the Berlin crisis"
#bra.7.d:0 "Following the Berlin panic, the Brazilian government has decided to stick to its policies of pleasing foreign creditors by maintaining convertibility according to the principles defended by the European and North American bankers who set the terms for our country's relations with the world economy. These acts have left the regime even more alienated from just about every segment of society."
#bra.8.t:0 "Bank panic!"
#bra.8.d:0 "Due to our horrible decision of suspending convertibility of the Real, a huge part of the middle classes and industrialists are running to the banks and withdrawing their deposits fearing the bankruptcy of these institutions. Many economists are now fearing even greater effects of the Berlin crisis in Brazil."
#bra.9.t:0 "The Economy Recovers"
#bra.9.d:0 "Brazil's economy has finally recovered from the backlash of the Berlin crisis. Our economists are saying that the worse is now behind us and Brazil can again look for a better future."
bra.10.t:0 "Agricultural Crisis"
bra.10.d:0 "We will now face our first challenge: how to deal with the current economic crisis? Our cabinet believes that the first steps must be taken on the fields. Since the beginning of the Berlin panic, world demand for our agricultural products has fallen dramatically, and the grand landowners (mainly the sugar and coffee barons) are struck with unsellable harvests. Soon more and more poor peasants will either starve or look for better opportunities in the cities, while the landowners will take the opportunity to blame the federal government for not helping them out of the mess. We could use this opportunity to initiate a broad land reform programme, but the landowners (especially the north-eastern coronéis) would of course raise their voices."
bra.10.a:0 "Land reform it is! Start the programme!"
bra.10.b:0 "We mustn't irritate the coronéis, hold the land reforms for a time."
bra.11.t:0 "Liberal-Democratas protest against the land reform"
bra.11.d:0 "Upon hearing about the planned land reform programmes, Chief Minister Borges de Medeiros rushed to the Palácio do Catete to demand explanations! He and the other Liberal-Democratas on the government see these programmes as an affront to the right to private property. Now, should we honour the will of the Brazilian workers and peasants who voted for us, or should we respect our coalition partners?"
bra.11.a:0 "Let him protest - the programme will go on."
bra.11.b:0 "We must respect our coalition partners - hold the land reforms for now"
bra.12.t:0 "The Second Coluna Prestes"
bra.12.d:0 "Two years ago, as the war against Argentina was still ongoing and the first mutinies were emerging, Luís Carlos Prestes led a battalion of some two hundred like-minded officers and corporals away from the front lines. Influenced by syndicalist ideals, the group spent the following years travelling across Brazil on horseback, speaking to the crowds about the futility of the war and spreading the word of social justice, while also fleeing from chasing police, army regulars and, especially in the north-eastern states, from paramilitary units of jagunços, the coronéis' thugs. The 'Prestes Column', as the group came to be known, camped from January to September 1935 on the hinterlands of Bahia, Pernambuco, Paraíba, Ceará and Piauí, seeing with their own eyes the harsh and miserable life of the poor sertanejo peasants, a chapter of our recent history that is seen as the birth of the left-tenentista movement. Now, as the syndicalist government of Brazil has announced their plans for an extensive land reform programme, Prestes has offered his services to us and will lead a new two-months-long survey mission to Bahia and Ceará, thus helping the commission to better implement their new policies and adapt them to the regional necessities."

bra.14.t:0 "The Second Coluna Prestes and the Cangaço"
bra.14.d:0 "Today, the 'Prestes Column' approached the city of Juazeiro, Ceará, where they were greeted on the outskirts of the city by a band of a few dozen cangaceiros under the command of Lampião, so-called the 'King of Cangaço'. On their constant fighting against the landowners' thugs, sometimes for their own personal glory, sometimes for a sincere protection of the poorer peasants, labelled either as heroes or bandits, the cangaceiros are an integral part of the complex social-political landscape of the north-eastern states. One of the column's members, a devoted Marxist of the PSR, lectured both the Coluna and the cangaceiros on how the movement can be seen as a spontaneous revolutionary movement of the poor men and women against the feudal oppression of the coronéis. Thus, he continues, if we could introduce the cangaço bands to the ANL programmes, they could serve us very well on political brawls against the conservative landowners of these states."

bra.17.d:0 "After dozens of surveys during the past months, a commission made up of members of the BOC, CBT and PSR, led by Minervino de Oliveira, has produced a white paper detailing three main plans for agrarian reform in Brazil. 'Plan A', defended by the BOC, proposes the collectivisation of all arable land and their reorganisation into smaller plots, headed by the peasants themselves, who will then organise and combine into cooperatives to sell their produce. The CBT-supported 'Plan B' sees the confiscation of all land by the federal government and its reorganisation into grand state farms employing the majority of the rural population. There's still one more possibility, the 'Plan C' defended by the PSR. This third, more moderate option, proposes the collectivisation of all the bigger farms and lands, while leaving the medium-sized and smaller lands still as private property. Plan C also defends the confiscation of unused plots and their reorganisation into cooperatives - a system similar to the Ejidos adopted by Mexico after their revolution. Any of these options will make the big landowners complain, of course, but we must stick to our plans if we want the betterment of Brazil!"

News of this growing conspiracy have already reached some parts of our cabinet. Now, how should our government act? We can't simply dismiss Prestes from the army, as that would bring the whole armed forces against the government. We could, instead, remove him from his present post and relocate him to some remote station... That would be enough of a punishment for him and would save everyone from any major scandal.

In Rio de Janeiro, president Edgard Leuenroth fled to the mountain areas of the state with his cabinet, while Prestes and Isidoro entered the Palácio do Catete.

Having arrived on Recife the previous night, the men moved northwest to Chico Heráclio's ranch. After a quick gunfight which left five of his jagunços dead, the remaining thugs surrendered. The hostages - two men and one woman - were freed and finally proceeded to deliver their eviction note to Heráclio, who was then arrested. This farm, formerly a land of exploitation, will be ploughed by his own former employees. Now that we have shown the coronéis our force and will to defend our ideals, the land reforms will go on untroubled. However, we must decide now on how to deal with the conservative state governments. Should we replace these governors with our own appointed Federal Auditors?

bra.27.d:0 "The 40-strong army detachment led by captain Juarez Távora sent to deal with the hostage crisis in Limoeiro, Pernambuco, has failed in their mission! Having arrived on Recife the previous night, the mission probably fell victim of an informant. As the men moved northwest to Chico Heráclio's ranch, a band of thirty jagunços shot on our surprised troops! Ten of our men died on the scene, and a fierce gunfight ensued, in which twelve of the thugs fell. An advanced party ran to the farmhouse only to find the three hostages - two men and one woman - dead and Chico Heráclio fleeing to the hinterlands. We have been humiliated! Not only that, but now he has to deal with the conservative state governors who take us responsible for the bloodbath!"

bra.28.d:0 "While Lampião and his band were approaching the city of Limoeiro, they were attacked by a small patrol of the Força Pública. The ill-prepared policemen, however, were no match for the cangaceiros, who proceeded to take control of the local police station and remaining public buildings. Meanwhile, the main force of thirty men under Lampião himself advanced towards Chico Heráclio's ranch, and a quick gunfight with the jagunços followed. Two of the cangaceiros fell on the scene, but they managed to kill or capture all thirty of Heráclio's thugs. Another five of Lampião's men raided the main farmhouse, where they found the three hostages - two men and one woman. As they were approaching one of the rooms to apprehend Chico Heráclio, the farmer shot the cangaceiros with his own revolver and hit two before being killed. Despite the bloodshed, the cangaceiros' raid was a success. This farm, formerly a land of exploitation, will be ploughed by Heráclio's own former employees. Plus, we are now sure of the loyalty of Lampião and his men to our agenda. Now that we have shown the coronéis our force and will to defend our ideals, our land reforms will go on untroubled.

bra.29.d:0 "Representatives of the Ministry of Agriculture met today in Recife with a delegation of state governors led by Pernambuco's Carlos de Lima Cavalcanti. The central government demands a greater cooperation of the conservative forces to our socialist reforms - something that the reactionaries find an insult. The governors, on the other hand, want less pressure from Rio and the option to a less severe application of the land reforms. With this conservative initiative receiving more and more support from the north-eastern elites, any concession may be seen as a threat to our progressive policies and will be regarded by other sectors of society as a sign of weakness by our government."

Some economists say that these enterprises are somewhat of a money drain to the state, big and ineffective companies diverting capital that would see better use in other areas. So, why don't we share these troubles with the private initiative? We could promote the establishment of public-private partnerships and make some of our companies into mixed-capital ventures. That way, we could use the expertise of the industrial capitalists but work them on a socialist framework. Orthodox Marxist economists, however, defend that we should keep these companies entirely with us, since they were established with taxpayer's money and thus belong to the people and the state of Brazil."

The CBT's Hermogênio da Silva Fernandes, however, defends that we should increase our investments into military research."

Unemployment rates still haven't dropped, while the increase in industrial output has been minimal. We are even starting to lose support among our own power base! The CBT syndicate has organised a four-hour-long strike in Rio de Janeiro demanding a review of these policies. Minervino de Oliveira, a leading figure of the CBT, proposes the transformation of more companies into cooperatives. According to him, if we give up some control of our companies and divert these responsibilities to the factory managers and to the workers themselves, they will come up with smartest decisions - better than handling every single local problem to a bureaucrat far away in Rio! Some parts of our cabinet, including our Minister of Industry, believe instead in increasing state control over these companies."

Much like the north-eastern coronéis in the past attempted to block the entrance of our federal employees to their farms, representatives of the Ministry of Industry are being prohibited from entering factories in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro by private security personnel.

It is hoped that we will be able to finally reach an agreement and continue our industrial reforms unimpeded.

Our security services are positioned on the harbour and expect an order from the federal government.

These latifúndios, however, also hold many unused plots, which could very well be occupied by landless farmers. One of our congressmen has put forward a proposal for a land reform programme which would distribute this empty land among poorer peasants.

Vargas himself has called the group to Rio de Janeiro to assure there's nothing to worry about. These measures will be useful to diminish the popularity of the extremist socialist movements among the peasants and even the urban proletariat - after all, why should they put their faith on a syndicate like the BOC if the federal government itself is fulfilling their needs?

With this in mind, our cabinet has proposed three different solutions to this issue. Filinto Müller of the Federal Police proposes a simple crackdown and dissolution of the trade unions! If we force these organisations underground, their political power will simply disappear. Our Ministry of Industry proposes instead that we simply replace their leadership with more loyal workers. By putting Integralist proletarians in power, we will be sure of the continuous support of the unions to our doctrine. The core of our regime, however, made of Plínio Salgado and other theorists like Gustavo Barroso and Miguel Reale, defend the integration of the syndicates on our government structure. 'Only by granting the proletarians an active voice on our government', they say, 'we can be sure that the demands of even the humblest of Brazilians will be listened'"
bra.68.a:0 "We must get rid of these socialist organisations."
bra.68.b:0 "Replace their leadership with loyal proletarians."
bra.68.c:0 "They will have an important place on Integralist society."
bra.69.t:0 "Outlaw the socialist parties?"
bra.69.d:0 "One of our senators has proposed legislation which outlaws all political organisations the government decides to label as 'socialist'. This would effectively move all serious opposition to our government underground. However, some elements of our cabinet think we should be very cautious now. A persecution of our opposition would alienate the tenuous support we have from the workers and the middle classes."
bra.69.a:0 "Of course! Get rid of this syndicalist scum!"
bra.69.b:0 "Now is not yet the time, that comes later."
bra.70.t:0 "The Patrianovistas"
bra.70.d:0 "Arlindo Veiga dos Santos, the leader of the Ação Imperial Patrianovista Brasileira (Brazilian Imperial New-Fatherland Action), has approached us. The Patrianovistas are a traditionalist Catholic group, professing a anti-liberalist, anti-socialist doctrine, favouring the restoration of the House of Braganza and a complete reshuffling of Brazilian society along a doctrine much similar to the Action Française of Nationalist France or Spanish Carlism - in fact, a thought much similar to our own Integralism. Many members of the Patrianovistas are also sympathisers (when not full members) of the Brazilian Integralist Action. The opposite is also true, with a few committed Integralists being also high-ranking Patrianovistas. Veiga dos Santos, now, has proposed a full merging of both movements, with the Patrianovistas becoming full members of the AIB. No matter how tempting this proposal may seem, we must take a careful approach. Many Integralists are traditionalist Catholics, but the militant monarchism of the Patrianovistas goes against some of our core principles."
bra.70.a:0 "These Traditionalists can be useful - Integrate them on the AIB."
bra.70.b:0 "Church boys? How can they be any useful? Ignore them!"
bra.71.t:0 "The Archbishop of São Paulo supports the AIB"
bra.71.d:0 "Dom Duarte Leopoldo e Silva, the archbishop of São Paulo, has congratulated the government on our decision to integrate the Patrianovistas into our Party. 'Catholicism is a part of Brazilian society since its beginning', he said. 'Having a government that will truly support the ideals of the Church will be a bless to this country'. So, we now are sure to have a greater support base for our policies."
bra.71.a:0 "The fire rises."

### Brazil-Bolivia Events ###
bra.200.t:0 "Alliance with Bolivia?"
bra.200.d:0 "The world is a dangerous place, so we need alliances with sworn enemies of the capitalism. Bolivia and Brazil could benefit from joining forces in a crusade for a new, brave world. Anti-socialist warmongers from La Plata are seeking war to crush the successful Brazilian and Bolivian revolutions, so we need to combine our powers to defend the spoils of our proletarian uprisings!"
bra.200.a:0 "Send a proposition."
bra.200.b:0 "There is no need for an alliance."
bra.201.t:0 "Alliance with Brazil?"
bra.201.d:0 "Syndicalist Brazil needs allies to crush the bourgeois La Plata. Do we want to sign an alliance with Brazil knowing that they can involve us into new local war?"
bra.201.a:0 "Yes, socialist countries should keep together."
bra.201.b:0 "No, Bolivia and its people need isolation."
bra.202.t:0 "Alliance between Brazil and Bolivia is formed"
bra.202.d:0 "The Bolivian state expressed its intention to join our alliance. For the world revolution!"
bra.202.a:0 "Welcome!"
bra.203.t:0 "Revolution in Bolivia!"
bra.203.d:0 "A few months ago, the rightful government of the Republic of Bolivia has been overthrown by syndicalist bands! Already their president has sought asylum in La Plata. We must find a way to prevent this rebellion from spreading towards us. Our military leaders have suggested increasing our presence in the border areas."
bra.203.a:0 "Raise new troops in the area."

### Civil War Events ###

bra.300.d:0 "Shocking news have just arrived from our capital as we learn that defeated presidential candidate Getúlio Vargas has gathered a few hundred followers in downtown Rio de Janeiro. What appeared to be a simple protest turned into a coup attempt, as an army unit showed up on the scene in support of Vargas. The mob is now threatening to invade the Palácio do Catete and depose our government!"

bra.301.d:0 "The Presidential Guard were given orders to crush the mob outside the Palace. Small in numbers, their morale at an all-time low, these elite men refused to fire on their own countrymen and instead joined the rebellion! With no other choice, Edgard Leuenroth was forced to flee the Palácio do Catete together with his cabinet. As Getúlio Vargas entered the building, army units soon recognised him as the new president of Brazil, followed by several state governors. By the end of the day, despite the heavy unrest, his rule went unopposed. He announced the formation of a new 'Government of National Security'. Their first act was the dissolution of the old Congress, which indicates that the new president will now rule by decree. A friendly cabinet of conservative politicians has also been called, headed by former Pernambuco governor Carlos de Lima Cavalcanti. On a long speech, Vargas and Cavalcanti denounced the wrongdoings of the ANL government, 'a government contaminated by the foreign and anti-Brazilian ideology called Syndicalism', and spoke on how their new government will work hard to undo all those 'polemic reforms which did so much harm to our society'. With syndicalist feelings still strong, they have a long road ahead."
