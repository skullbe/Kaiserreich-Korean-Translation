The MVSN, or as they are informally called 'Camicie Nere' for their black shirts have been popping up throughout the kingdom, from Naples to Palermo and everything in between. Supposedly lead by Achille Starace, this paramilitary organisation is described as the muscle behind the Integralisti in the Kingdom for they have been keeping watch during their rallies, as well disrupting and breaking up rallies of the left wing. Their disciplined, militaristic marches through the streets of major cities draw large crowds, and drum up more recruits, especially amongst the youth.\n\nThe Camicie Nere is rapidly becoming a force to be reckoned with, and their numbers are still expanding - it's unlikely they'll stay silent during the elections..."

This disruption quickly turned into a bloody battle that left quite a few injured, and even worse a few fatalities on both sides. While the CGSL has forsworn syndicalism, the Camicie Nere have been lately decrying their members as agents to the Socialist Republic in the North.\n\nNow the outcome of this particular case must be decided. Are these members innocent, or do the words of the Camicie Nere hold merit and truth? Many conservatives are siding with the Camicie Nere, declaring that they are traitors to the Kingdom, while some of the Liberals claim that they are innocent."

This liberal pact is dedicated to preserving and strengthening liberal values within the Kingdom.\n\nThe creation of this alliance, however, weakens the Social Democratic party, for in the past the Partito Librale tended to support the Partito Cristiano Democratico.

sic.61.d:0 "One of the concerns for the Kingdom is the succession to the throne of the Two Sicilies. The issue is that King Ferdinand only has daughters and at 67 years old, he is rather unlikely to have any more children. However, the issue is that his two brothers dispute whom should be the heir as the current law states only men can inherit.\n\nNormally according to the laws of the land, the throne would go to Ferdinand's brother Prince Carlos and his decedents, however, Ferdinand's other brother, Prince Ranieri disputes that claim citing the act of Cannes of 1900, due to Carlos' marriage to the Spanish princess Mercedes that put him in line for the Spanish throne.\n\nHowever a third alternative is to declare that the throne will instead follow male-preference, and thereby make Ferdinand's eldest daughter Princess Maria Antonietta the heir whom would become Queen in her own right."

sic.64.d:0 "When the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was re-made after the Weltkrieg, an act by the Parliament in Naples granted the Isle of Sicily considerable autonomy. This act granted the island its own regional parliament. This has granted the island quite a bit of power and influence within the Kingdom's politics."
