### Events ###
afg.0.t:0 "The 5th Anglo-Afghan War?"
afg.0.d:0 "In the remnants of the Raj to our south, dissent has sprung up like wildflowers in the wake of Edward VIII's succession. In Kabul, we have our own troubles keeping the latent discontent of reform down. A repeat of the victorious Fourth Anglo-Afghan War might cement our own position whilst winning new lands and subjects for the crown!"
afg.0.a:0 "The time is ripe! Let us repeat our victories!"
afg.0.b:0 "What does India have but cows?"

afg.1.t:0 "The Third Treaty of Rawalpindi"
afg.1.d:0 "Catastrophe! Our campaign against the Delhi Government has been crowned with spectacular failure and our armies forced through the Pass of Khyber, fleeing in panic. The vice-roy, Ganga Singh, has offered peace - demanding a restoration of the pre-1926 borders. Unfortunately we are unable to decline, lest our very nation be destroyed..."
afg.1.d.puppet:0 "Catastrophe! Our campaign against the Delhi Government has been crowned with spectacular failure and our armies forced through the Pass of Khyber, fleeing in panic. The vice-roy, Ganga Singh, has offered peace - demanding a restoration of the pre-1926 borders and the permanent submission of our government to theirs. Unfortunately we are unable to decline, lest our very nation be destroyed..."
afg.1.a:0 "We yield because we have no other choice..."

afg.2.t:0 "The Third Treaty of Rawalpindi"
afg.2.d:0 "Victory is ours! The decadent British lapdogs in Delhi have been utterly routed and our forces are entrenched in the smouldering remains of their capital. Now might be the best time to demand concessions, whilst we still carry the lead."

afg.3.t:0 "Demands of the Emir"
afg.3.d:0 "Curses! The Afghan dogs have completely overpowered us and have reduced our proud nation to humiliation. Now the Afghan Emir demands our surrender of the princely state of Kashmir and access to the Mouth of the Indus. Although these are harsh terms, it might be wise to comply - lest our rivals on the continent act on our exposed situation."
afg.3.a:0 "We yield because we have no other choice..."
afg.3.b:0 "They must be joking, Hindustan Zindabad!"

afg.5.t:0 "Shia Muslims Flee The War"
afg.5.d:0 "For decades the situation of the Shia minority in Afghanistan have been bad, the post-war situation wasn't gold, and another war could possibly only make it worse. Shia imams in the provinces of Herat and Farah have encouraged the shia minority to flee into their friendly neighbour Persia. Let's hope the Persians send them back, we need that manpower."
afg.5.a:0 "Traitors!"

afg.6.t:0 "Refugees from Afghanistan"
afg.6.d:0 "Yet another war has started between Afghanistan and Dehli. The Shia minority in Afghanistan fears this will only make their situation worse, therefor they have decided to start a new life here, however this situation might be more problematic then what we think. If we accept these people into our nation the government of Afghanistan will be deeply upset with us."
afg.6.a:0 "They shall be more than welcome, settle them in Mashad!"

afg.10.t:0 "Afghanistan in Chaos!"
afg.10.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, rebel forces have pushed the troops of king Amanullah out of Kabul and are in effect in control of the country!"

afg.11.t:0 "The Foreign Relations of the Emirate of Afghanistan"
afg.11.d:0 "Habibullah Kalakani has finally brought Islamic order to the people of Afghanistan and established himself as the undisputed ruler of our nation. After our defeat by the Indian government, his majesty has proposed to court the Islamic Federation of Turkestan for an alliance to safeguard us from further military conflict with the Indians."
afg.11.a:0 "Let us align with the Islamic Federation of Turkestan!"

afg.14.t:0 "Mohammed Nadir Shah's Claim to the Throne"

afg.15.b:0 "The assembly denounces Mohammed Nadir!"

afg.16.t:0 "Nadir Shah's Royal Oligarchy"
afg.16.d:0 "With the war-torn country finally resembling some kind of order, Nadir Shah has resolved to reorganise his cabinet to secure continued stability for Afghanistan. Packing the government with relatives would be the obvious way to bind the state apparatus to Nadir's ambitions, but reaching out to some of Amanullah's supporters might also bridge a wide gap between the radical and moderate reformists."
afg.16.a:0 "Let my younger brother, Shah Wali Khan, enforce my will!"

afg.17.t:0 "Status of Amanullah's Reforms"
afg.17.d:0 "Mohammed Nadir Shah has taken control of our shaken nation after the failure of Amanullah Khan to enforce Afghan progress. Well aware that a great contributing factor of his predecessor's downfall was the speed of his westernisation reforms, Nadir Shah none the less has to address the great issue of rebuilding Afghanistan."
afg.17.a:0 "Discontinue social reform, but galvanise the improvement of our infrastructure!"
afg.17.b:0 "Cave in to the traditionalists and abandon all pretence of modernity!"
afg.17.c:0 "I shall succeed where Amanullah failed and bring Afghanistan into the modern world!"

afg.18.t:0 "Sarrafs have left Afghanistan"
afg.18.d:0 "Sarrafs are a group of Indian merchants who travel between Afghanistan and Delhi, exchanging money and trading goods in both of them. Our economy hardly depends on their visits. Now, the war has come and borders are safe no more. Only a few of these sarrafs are brave enough to continue trading with us. With most of their caravan are gone we now suffer from economic crisis."
afg.18.a:0 "We don't need these Indian dogs anyway!"

afg.19.t:0 "Sarrafs returns"
