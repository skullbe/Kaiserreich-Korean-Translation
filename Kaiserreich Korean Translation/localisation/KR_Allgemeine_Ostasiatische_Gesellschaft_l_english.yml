allgost.3.b:0 "NO! We cannot let this happen! Buy them now!"
allgost.4.t:0 "The Reactionary Reforms"
allgost.4.d:0 "Since the Burning of the Head-Office, the Board realises a change in policy is required if its going to improve its fiscal outlook and keep Nationalist sentiments in Southern and Central China under control.

Almost overnight, fully one third of Southern China's workforce was unemployed. A large majority of these people became migratory workers, moving from job to job in great masses.
