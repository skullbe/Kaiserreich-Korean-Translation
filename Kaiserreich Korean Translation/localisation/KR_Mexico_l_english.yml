mexico.1.t:0 "Assassination attempt on President Zapata"
mexico.1.d:0 "Breaking news from Mexico City! This morning, as he was about to attend a meeting with local syndicalists in the Zócalo square, president Emiliano Zapata was stabbed in the head with an ice-pick by an unknown assailant! The suspect fled through the narrow streets of downtown Mexico City, and the local police is still after him. Meanwhile, Zapata was rushed to a nearby hospital, where a battle between life and death ensues..."
mexico.1.a:0 "He quickly recovers and will be back to action in a few days"
mexico.1.b:0 "Our dear president is dead and a power struggle ensues"
mexico.2.t:0 "Zapata is dead!"
mexico.2.d:0 "This morning, the Hero of the Revolution and President of Mexico, Emiliano Zapata, passed away from the injuries he sustained after a terrorist attack in Mexico City. Immediately after his death, several groups, from loyal politicians to reactionary generals, initiated a power struggle to seize control of the government and the military."

mexico.3.d:0 "Yesterday, following the death of President Zapata, Vicente Toledano was sworn-in by the Senate. The new president is now expected to deliver his first words to the nation. Most importantly, the people is anxious regarding the next presidential elections, scheduled for June. Will they still happen? Maybe they will only be postponed?"

mexico.4.d:0 "Yesterday, following the death of President Zapata, Plutarco Calles and his military clique seized the Palacio Nacional. The new president is now expected to deliver his first words to the nation. Most importantly, the people is anxious regarding the next presidential elections, scheduled for June.

The new president is now expected to deliver his first words to the nation. Most importantly, the people is anxious regarding the next presidential elections, scheduled for June.

mexico.5.a:0 "The elections will take place as expected"
mexico.5.b:0 "The elections will be postponed until December"
mexico.5.c:0 "Suspend the elections, the Junta is here to stay"

mexico.6.a:0 "We need this guy alive! Get him!"
mexico.7.t:0 "Ramón Mercader under arrest"
mexico.7.d:0 "Just a few hours ago, the police has managed to arrest Ramón Mercader in connection to the attack on Emiliano Zapata! Mercader, a 23-year old immigrant from Spain, was captured in the neighbourhood of Villa Coyoacán.

mexico.7.c:0 "Arrest Calles and all those involved in this conspiracy!"
mexico.8.t:0 "Presidential Elections, 1936"
mexico.8.d:0 "The 1936 presidential elections have begun today. The many factions of the hegemonic Party of the Mexican Revolution (PRM), from the mainstream Villistas and Zapatistas to the anarchist Magonistas, the Social-Democrats and even the fringe Totalists, have all fielded their own candidates. Challenges for our next president range from internal political opposition to instability in the USA across the Rio Grande."
mexico.8.a:0 "Pancho Villa will keep the revolutionary ideals alive"
mexico.8.b:0 "Vincente Toledano, the dean of Mexican Syndicalism"
mexico.8.c:0 "Plutarco Elías Calles, the hard-line general"
mexico.8.e:0 "Lazaro Cardenas, the middle-ground moderate"
mexico.9.t:0 "Reclaiming our lost territories"
mexico.9.d:0 "In 1848, as a result of our defeat in the Mexican-American War, we were forced to cede nearly half of our territory to the United States as per the provisions of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The reversion of this treaty has been a dream for the Mexican people since then. Now, with the USA at war, this could be our chance to regain our lost lands and reassert Mexican control north of the Rio Grande, from California all the way to Texas!"
mexico.9.a:0 "Demand the return of our territories"
mexico.9.b:0 "We can't afford direct conflict, just stake our claims"
mexico.9.c:0 "Are you mad? This is too dangerous!"
mexico.10.t:0 "Mexican territorial demands"
mexico.10.d:0 "Mexico has decided to use the ongoing American Civil War as an opportunity to reclaim the territories they lost to us due to the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo! How should we react?"
mexico.10.a:0 "Cede disputed territory, we can't afford another front"
mexico.10.b:0 "Never! Those lands are American!"
mexico.11.t:0 "The Americans refuse our demands"
mexico.11.d:0 "The foolish leadership of the United States has refused to accept our rightful territorial claims. What shall we do now?"
mexico.11.a:0 "War will solve this!"
mexico.11.b:0 "We are not ready for war"
mexico.12.t:0 "The second Mexican-American War"
mexico.12.d:0 "Our refusal to accept the Mexican territorial claims was the last straw. They decided to declare war upon us in order to try to gain those disputed territories by force. Now, troops of the National Guard, together with volunteers from local population, are being mobilised to repel the Mexican assaults!"
mexico.12.a:0 "They must be stopped!"
mexico.13.t:0 "The Treaty of Acapulco"
mexico.13.d:0 "We've successfully beaten the American army and conquered the disputed border states. Now, we can send their humiliated leadership a peace in which they promise to recognise our territorial gains and withdrawn from disputed territory, however we could keep going in this war to try and get more land. What should we do?"
mexico.13.a:0 "Sue for peace, we have had enough"
mexico.13.b:0 "We shall reclaim all of our lands"
mexico.14.t:0 "We have lost much of our territory!"
mexico.14.d:0 "What a disaster! A good portion of the Southwestern USA has been lost to the advancing Mexican Army. The Mexicans have offered us peace, with their troops threatening to advance even deeper, this is the time to accept our defeat and cede them the disputed territory."
mexico.14.a:0 "Accept their claims, we must end this war right now"
mexico.14.b:0 "No compromise until we are marching on their capital"
mexico.15.t:0 "The Treaty of Acapulco"
mexico.15.d:0 "According to the Treaty of Acapulco, the Americans must cede a good part of their territory to us"
mexico.15.a:0 "Hooray!"
mexico.16.t:0 "The Treaty of Acapulco"
mexico.16.d:0 "We've successfully beaten the American army and conquered the disputed border states. Now, we can send their humiliated leadership a peace in which they promise to recognise our territorial gains and withdrawn from all the territories that we cede them in our last war. Taking any more would be loco!"
mexico.16.a:0 "Sue for peace"
mexico.17.t:0 "Peace offer from Mexico"
mexico.17.d:0 "What a disaster! A good portion of the Southwestern USA has been lost to the advancing Mexican Army. The Mexicans have offered us peace, with their troops threatening to advance even deeper, this is the time to accept our defeat and cede them the disputed territory."
mexico.17.a:0 "Accept The Offer"
mexico.17.b:0 "Decline The Offer"
mexico.18.t:0 "The Treaty of Acapulco"
mexico.18.d:0 "According to the Treaty of Acapulco, the Americans must cede all the lands we ceded to them in our last war back to us"
mexico.18.a:0 "Hooray!"
mexico.28.t:0 "War against the Pacific States?"
mexico.28.d:0 "Another rebel faction of the American Civil War, the Pacific States of America, currently control an area composed of the western seaboard - this includes our rightful territories of Alta California. We should attack them immediately!"
mexico.28.a:0 "Attack!"
mexico.28.b:0 "We are tired of conflict already"
mexico.29.t:0 "Victory over the Pacific States"
mexico.29.d:0 "The Mexican army has overcome the armies of the Pacific States of America and are now in a position to demand terms. Some in the government want the whole of California to be returned to Mexico but others feel that aggressive demands will lead to another possible war in the future."
mexico.29.a:0 "Demand all of California"
mexico.29.b:0 "Demand the southern half of California"
mexico.29.c:0 "Continue the Offensive, the Pacific coast shall be ours"
mexico.30.t:0 "Mexico demands all of California"
mexico.30.d:0 "We have been beaten by Mexico in the war and they have demanded Arizona and all of California. The people want to keep resisting but there may be no options left..."
mexico.30.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept"
mexico.30.b:0 "No deal, we fight to the end"
mexico.31.t:0 "Mexico demands Southern California"
mexico.31.d:0 "We have been beaten by Mexico in the war and they have demanded Arizona and Southern California. The people want to keep resisting but there may be no options left."
mexico.31.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept"
mexico.31.b:0 "No deal, fight to the end"
mexico.32.t:0 "The PSA accepts Our Demands"
mexico.32.d:0 "The PSA has seen the wisdom of accepting our demands and we can now look forward to having California back. This is a great day for Mexico."
mexico.32.a:0 "Excellent"
mexico.33.t:0 "The PSA refuses our demands"
mexico.33.d:0 "The PSA has refused to accept our demands and now we must destroy them."
mexico.33.a:0 "Bastards"
mexico.34.t:0 "PSA troops occupy Baja California"
mexico.34.d:0 "Troops of the Pacific States have occupied the Baja California peninsula of Mexico! With our troops about to advance deeper into Mexico, maybe this is the perfect opportunity for press claims for a peace settlement to our advantage."
mexico.34.a:0 "Send the envoys"
mexico.34.b:0 "No peace until we're marching on Mexico City"
mexico.35.t:0 "Peace proposal from the Pacific States"
mexico.35.d:0 "Troops of the Pacific States have occupied the Baja California peninsula of Mexico! With their troops about to advance deeper into Mexico, they have seized the opportunity and sent their envoys to negotiate a peace settlement that is most advantageous to them. Should we accept their claims to Baja California and end the conflict?"
mexico.35.a:0 "Accept their offer"
mexico.35.b:0 "No peace until we're marching on Sacramento"
mexico.35.c:0 "Continue the war, we will crush the PSA"
mexico.36.t:0 "Old and new dynasties"
mexico.36.d:0 "As our government has decided to restore the Mexican monarchy, now we must decide which dynasty shall ascend to the throne. Should we invite Doña María Anna Tunkl-Iturbide, of the House of Habsburg-Itúrbide? Since she is, famously, granddaughter of Salvador de Itúrbide (grandson of our first emperor Agustín and an adopted son of our second monarch Maximilian I), she would be most appreciated by the traditional Catholics, conservative politicians and would put us on good relations with the European powers. On the other hand, a 'nativist' clique has emerged, supporting the claims of Don Fernando de Teruel, current holder of the Spanish title of Duke of Moctezuma de Tultengo - thus, a descendent of Aztec emperor Moctezuma II."
mexico.36.a:0 "Support the claims of Doña María Anna de Habsburgo-Itúrbide"
mexico.36.b:0 "Choose Don Fernando, the Duke of Moctezuma"
mexico.37.t:0 "The Sinarquistas Attack!"
mexico.37.d:0 "The top leadership of the Unión Nacional Sinarquista are at this moment attempting a coup against our government! Hundreds of their Goldshirt militias have surrounded the Palacio Nacional, while rumour has it that army troops sympathetic to their cause are rushing towards Mexico City. They demand the surrender of the current cabinet and their replacement by their own party!"
mexico.37.a:0 "The Sinarquistas succeed and establish a new government"
mexico.38.t:0 "The Anglo Rebellion"
mexico.38.d:0 "The vast majority of the population in our new northern states are English speaking "Anglos" who are resisting our rule. They are well armed and many fear that they will try to rebel against us."
mexico.38.a:0 "The Gringos will learn to accept our rule"
mexico.39.t:0 "Gringo Riots!"
mexico.39.d:0 "The Anglo population in our occupied territories have staged a number of protests, ranging from peaceful gatherings and illegal parades to major protests and acts of vandalism. Obviously, it will take a really, really long time until these gringos accept our rightful rule over Tejas, Nuevo Mexico and Alta California…"
mexico.39.a:0 "Riots occur in major cities"
mexico.40.t:0 "Actions of the Anglo resistance"
mexico.40.d:0 "The resistance of the Anglo population against our occupation forces continues. Once again, terrorist groups operating within the Northern territories have staged a number of attacks aimed on crippling our infrastructure, our industrial output and the morale of our forces."
mexico.40.a:0 "Saboteurs bomb a number of important factories"
mexico.40.b:0 "Guerrilleros sabotage our transport infrastructure"
mexico.40.c:0 "Guerrilleros stage organised hit-and-run raids against our troops"
mexico.41.t:0 "Major Anglo Offensive!"
mexico.41.d:0 "We are under attack! Leaders of the Anglo resistance in the North have launched a major coordinated uprising against our troops!"
mexico.41.a:0 "¡Oh! Y ahora, ¿Quién podrá defenderme?"
mexico.42.t:0 "Attack by Anglo guerrillas!"
mexico.42.d:0 "The Anglo insurrectionists in the North have launched a full-on assault against our occupation forces!"
mexico.42.a:0 "Damn them!"
mexico.45.t:0 "The anti-clerical policies of Mexico"
mexico.45.d:0 "Our president is a known militant atheist and an opponent of the Catholic Church. Over the past months, he and his close advisers have begun to move to enforce the anti-clerical articles of the Mexican Constitution of 1917 — including provisions such as depriving the Church of its property rights and depriving the clergy of a number of civil liberties."
mexico.45.a:0 "Yes, begin persecution of the Catholic Church"
mexico.46.t:0 "Catholic unrest"
mexico.46.d:0 "The Catholics in our country are not reacting well to our persecution of their church, and they are beginning to rebel against us. Should the persecution continue?"
mexico.46.a:0 "Keep up the anti-clerical campaign"
mexico.46.b:0 "They already had enough, suspend further persecution"
mexico.47.t:0 "The Cristero Uprising begins"
mexico.47.d:0 "The anti-Catholic persecution of our president has caused a number of rebellions in Central Mexico. Local peasants, aided by conservative politicians and the remainders of the Catholic hierarchy, have taken up arms! Rallying under the banner of the Cristo Rey and Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe, these bandits have pledged to defend their right to practice their faith!"
mexico.47.a:0 "To arms!"
mexico.48.t:0 "Catholic uprising in Mexico"
mexico.48.d:0 "The anti-Catholic persecution undertaken by Mexico's socialist president has reached such outrageous results that tens of thousands of peasants have taken up arms against the government! Aided by the remnants of the old elites and local priests, these rebels are rallying under the banners of El Cristo Rey and Nuestra Señora de Guadaloupe and pledged to defend their faith! Some members of our foreign service have proposed that we send supplies and volunteers to help this rebellion."
mexico.48.a:0 "Support them, send supplies and volunteers"
mexico.48.b:0 "We should not get involved"
mexico.49.t:0 "Italian involvement in La Cristiada"
mexico.49.d:0 "The Papist government of Italy has lent their support to the Catholic uprising in Central Mexico. Hundreds of their military advisers and a good cache of arms have arrived to the rebel-held lands. We can't tolerate their meddling in our internal affairs!"
mexico.49.a:0 "Damn them!"
mexico.50.t:0 "The end of the Cristero Uprising"
mexico.50.d:0 "The Mexican Army, after a tough fight, has managed to defeat the Cristero Uprising, also known as La Cristiada. At last, Mexico is free from the perfidious influence of the Catholic Church! We can now continue our reforms and keep up with our project of transforming the country into a respected atheist republic."
mexico.50.a:0 "At last, establish official state atheism"
mexico.51.t:0 "Calles Embraces Totalism"
mexico.51.d:0 "After his return flight from the Union of Britain there are rumours that he is working on a new project to reform the Partido and advance his brand of Totalism here in Mexico..."
mexico.51.a:0 "Let's hope it doesn't come to that"
mexico.52.t:0 "Fate of Hollywood"
mexico.52.d:0 "With Alta California finally ours again, we need to decide what to do with its film industry, once a pillar of U.S. capitalist propaganda. The Comité is divided between leaving them be (barring our new film censorship and approval board), expropriation, and purging the area to build something far more useful for el pueblo. While industrialising the studios would boost California's recovery, the studios make a lot of taxable money, and our new citizens Norteños will be upset…"
mexico.52.a:0 "Leave them alone, remember they helped finance los Villistas"
mexico.52.b:0 "Consolidate the studios under government control"
mexico.52.c:0 "Hollywood belongs to its workers!"
mexico.52.e:0 "Purge the studios and build heavy industry!"
mexico.53.t:0 "Reorganisation of the Territories"
mexico.53.d:0 "National elation over La Reconquista continues in full swing. Unfortunately, overwhelming euphoria is not without its overzealous drawbacks. Recently, certain national activists, civil administrators and other (generally traditionalist) voices have advocated that since the old northern territories have returned to us, we should likewise return the nature of their civil administration along revanchist lines - that is, the former U.S. states should be redrawn to match the pre-1848 borders of Alta California, Nuevo Mexico, Texas, even the Oregon Territory if our new gains allow it. These 'conservatives' argue that such a reorganisation would centralise administration of the old U.S. states and streamline governance over the North while exalting Mexican pride and erasing the estadounidense colonialism over Mexico's ancestral lands. The 'progressive' faction, meanwhile, dismiss these borders as vague even for the time, and further denounce the scheme as archaic, impractical and bound to outrage the Anglos more than ever. Instead, the progressives argue, the established former U.S. State administrations are already functional, well-organised and stable, and therefore should be adopted in full and merely expanded upon. Today, the Comité de Ocupación del Norte is scheduled hold a meeting and to adjourn with a decision on the matter.
mexico.53.a:0 "Conservative: Revert to traditional borders"
mexico.53.b:0 "Progressive: Expand on existing state apparatus"
mexico.54.t:0 "The Fate of the Alamo"
mexico.54.d:0 "It was inevitable that the question of that decaying symbol known as the Alamo would arise. As it stands, the Alamo is a rallying point for insurrectionists and a shrine for the old regime. Therefore, a resolution has been called for to renovate the building and thus repurpose its symbolic value — but again, this may only serve to incur the wrath of the gringos. As per the directive of the Comité de Ocupación del Norte, the Alamo will be…"
mexico.54.a:0 "Preserved as a cultural heritage site"
mexico.54.b:0 "A war dead memorial"
mexico.54.c:0 "Demolished! With urban expansion built over it for good measure!"
mexico.55.t:0 "The Status of American Indians"
mexico.55.d:0 "With a change in government it is only natural that ostracised groups will seek support from the new government in hopes of finally overturning their fortunes. In this case, it is America's first peoples, with which we share a lineage of American nativity and European colonialism. Deprived also of their territory, as well as their sovereignty, Indians now live like zoo animals in reservations, where poverty is rampant, and the Indian Citizenship Act of 1936 does not go far enough in repairing centuries of subjugation. Therefore, we should expand on the act, as it is our moral imperative that we grant assistance to the destitute American Indian and begin lifting them from oppression at last."
mexico.55.a:0 "Yes, we stand alongside the oppressed Indian"
mexico.55.b:0 "Will we ever stop enraging the Americans with all the guns?!"
mexico.56.t:0 "Status of Women in the Territories"
mexico.56.d:0 "Anglo women have taken to the streets in planned demonstrations — not against Mexican occupation, but for women's rights. While generally critical of Mexico's actions, suffragists have decided to make the best of our progressive government and have thus petitioned Mexico to succeed where Washington failed — officially extend Mexico's Constitutional rights of women to the territories."
mexico.56.a:0 "Grant universal rights for all women!"
mexico.56.b:0 "Grant women voting rights in all local assemblies!"
mexico.56.c:0 "Now is not the best time"
mexico.57.t:0 "Status of Religion in the Territories"
mexico.57.d:0 "While Mexico has historically been a Catholic country, the Anglos take on the religious heritage of England, Protestantism. The people in the territories — Texas in particular — are deeply religious, so the Comité has to tread carefully on religious policy. It would be foolish, however, to ignore intelligence reports from our spy service which emphasise how the local churches are condoning, aiding and abetting the insurrectionists, many of whom are zealous Protestants themselves."
mexico.57.a:0 "Enforce Catholicism as the state religion"
mexico.57.b:0 "Enforce anti-clerical laws of 1917 Constitution"
mexico.57.c:0 "Let the Protestants freely go about their business"
mexico.58.t:0 "Status of Language in the Territories"
mexico.58.d:0 "The majority of both the Mexican and Anglo populations do not speak the others' language, which is already causing incidents in the territories. While forcing the entire Anglo population to learn and speak Spanish would be… impractical, perhaps some basic public works could assist our troops and settlers in the North. The principal subject of today's Comité meeting is: From schools and government to restaurants and street signs, what will be the official language in the territories?"
mexico.58.a:0 "Español"
mexico.58.b:0 "Bilingüe/Bilingual"
mexico.58.c:0 "English"
mexico.59.t:0 "The Reintegration of the Mexican Cession"
mexico.59.d:0 "After many years of extensive resettlement, intensive propaganda efforts and numerous crushed uprisings, organised revolt against Mexican governance has largely subsided. While some resistance persists among old militia extremists, Anglos at large have gradually come to terms with our rule and settlers are now a significant minority in the North. With Los Territorios Reconquistados firmly under our control, we've won unhindered access to its resources and industry."
mexico.59.a:0 "Finally!"
mexico.60.t:0 "Restructuring The Regime"
mexico.60.d:0 "The Junta has now ruled for quite a while, and keeping the people under control has been difficult, some are calling for a restructuring of the regime, and we are faced with 3 options. The first option is to find an ally for the Junta, either the Industrialists or the Hacienderos, The second option is to restore the monarchy to try and gain legitimacy for our regime, The third option is to invite the Sinarquistas into our government to gain another ally in Mexico. What should we choose?"
mexico.60.a:0 "Keep The Junta"
mexico.60.b:0 "Restore The Monarchy"
mexico.60.c:0 "Invite The Sinarquistas"
mexico.61.t:0 "Choosing An Economic Plan"
mexico.61.d:0 "It is time for Mexico to choose an economic plan for the coming years. On one hand we have Plan "Hope" which focuses on the civilian sector of our economy and improving infastructure and on the other hand we have Plan "Unity" which focuses on heavy industrial expansion and military industry. Which one should we pick?"
mexico.61.a:0 "Plan Hope"
mexico.61.b:0 "Plan Unity"
mexico.62.t:0 "Teacher's Union Demands"
mexico.62.d:0 "The powerful Teacher's Union have a strong position in the CTM, and have just come forward with demands for better rights and pay for teachers. Fulfilling their demands will likely improve the quality of our nation's education, but it will obviously cost us some money. What should we do?"
mexico.62.a:0 "Fulfil their demands"
mexico.62.b:0 "Refuse to fulfil their demands"
mexico.63.t:0 "Railway Worker's Union Demands"
mexico.63.d:0 "The powerful Railway Worker's Union have a strong position in the CTM, and have just come forward with demands for better rights and pay for Railway Workers. Fulfilling their demands will likely improve the quality of our nation's railways and trains, but it will obviously cost us some money. What should we do?"
mexico.63.a:0 "Fulfil their demands"
mexico.63.b:0 "Refuse to fulfil their demands"
mexico.69.t:0 "Miner's Union Demands"
mexico.69.d:0 "The powerful Miner's Union have a strong position in the CTM, and have just come forward with demands for better rights and pay for Miners. Fulfilling their demands will likely improve the quality of our nation's mines and resource excavation, but it will obviously cost us some money. What should we do?"
mexico.69.a:0 "Fulfil their demands"
mexico.69.b:0 "Refuse to fulfil their demands"
mexico.64.t:0 "The Americans demand their lost territories"
mexico.64.d:0 "During the American Civil War, the Mexican army managed to conquer a good part of the western and southwestern American states. Despite a well-organised campaign of both non-violent resistance and guerrilla attacks by the local Anglo population, we are determined to continue our occupation. Now, with their Civil War over, the American government is demanding that we return them these former territories. And, according to our intelligence reports, they are even considering going to war against Mexico for this! Even if we know that we have a historical right to those lands, we must keep in mind that the Americans are much more strong and organised now - it is very possible that, in case of war, we may not resist their offensive."
mexico.64.a:0 "Accept their demands, we can't hope to win another war"
mexico.64.b:0 "Let them come, we're ready to defend our land"
mexico.65.t:0 "Mexico accepts our demands"
