FNG_CHI_CONQUERED:0 "We Unified China"
FNG_Fortress_Manchuria_i:0 "Fortress Manchuria"
FNG_Fortress_Manchuria_i_desc:0 "The Yan Mountains to the South, the Lesser Khigan Range to the West, and the Bohai Gulf to the East create a natural fortress around the Manchurian plain, leaving the Shanhai Pass as the only easy point of entry. It is easy to fortify the Northeast when nature has already done so much of the work."
FNG_The_National_Reclamation_War:0 "The National Reclamation War"
FNG_The_National_Reclamation_War_desc:0 "The time has come to reclaim the South and cast down the regressive Qing. The nation rallies behind its leader in the push toward victory!"
FNG_Backward_Industry:0 "Backward Industry"
FNG_Backward_Industry_desc:0 "While Fengtian may contain the second largest industrial base in East Asia, its size conceals obsolete machinery, inefficient practices, and severe mismanagement. Only extensive reforms, backed by a great deal of investment, can overcome these challenges."
FNG_Unscrupulous_Governance:0 "Unscrupulous Governance"
FNG_Unscrupulous_Governance_desc:0 "Despite its claims to the contrary, the Fengtian Government is plagued by endemic corruption, incompetence, and abuse of power. While this is nothing out of the ordinary for China, it impedes the proper functioning of government, and limits support for the regime."
FNG_Investment_Dearth:0 "Investment Dearth"
FNG_Investment_Dearth_desc:0 "The economic collapse that followed Fengtian's entry into the Civil Wars severely damaged its fiscal base and financial credibility, leaving the government with few creditors, and private businesses with severely limited options. Few have the confidence to invest in Fengtian, either at home or abroad."
FNG_Land_Reform_Underway:0 "Land Reform Underway"
FNG_Land_Reform_Underway_desc:0 "Land reform is a long and difficult process, and will cost the state in the short term, but prosperity awaits over the horizon."
FNG_Japanese_Aid_Cut:0 "Japanese Aid Cut"
FNG_Japanese_Aid_Cut_desc:0 "Japan has cut all aid to the government as a means of punishment for what it sees as insubordination."
FNG_Buying_Silver:0 "Buying Silver"
FNG_Buying_Silver_desc:0 "Silver, by definition, is expensive and the government is presently buying a great deal of it. Once the reserve is full, however, it will have a reliable basis for currency and credit."
FNG_Central_Bank_Collapse:0 "Central Bank Collapse"
FNG_Central_Bank_Collapse_desc:0 "The Central Bank seems to have misplaced millions of taels worth of silver precisely as Japanese banks called for their loans to be repaid. How could this have happened?"
FNG_Japanese_Military_Mission:0 "Japanese Military Mission"
FNG_Japanese_Military_Mission_desc:0 "Japan has had a military presence in Fengtian since at least the early twenties, but the intervention of 1926 saw the dispatch of a permanent military mission, which provides military aid and 'advises' the government. Unfortunately, ignoring this advice can have dire consequences."
FNG_Educational_Vacuum:0 "Educational Vacuum"
FNG_Educational_Vacuum_desc:0 "The sudden absence of Japanese teachers, professors, and scientists has left a troublesome educational vaccuum. Foreign and domestic replacements can be found, but at a cost, and not without great inconvenience."
FNG_Post-Colonial_Chaos_1:0 "Post-Colonial_Chaos"
FNG_Post-Colonial_Chaos_1_desc:0 "Even at its most limited, Mantetsu's grip on Fengtian's economy and infrastructure was tight, and now as its carefully laid systems and structures collapse, the country as a whole is crippled. It will take time to rebuild and reorganize, but if Mantetsu's influence was greater, it could have been far worse."
FNG_Post-Colonial_Chaos_2:0 "Post-Colonial Chaos"
FNG_Post-Colonial_Chaos_2_desc:0 "Mantetsu's grip on Fengtian's politics, economy, and infrastructure was tight, and now as its carefully laid systems and structures collapse, the country as a whole is crippled. It will take time to rebuild and reorganize, but if Mantetsu's influence was even greater, it could have been worse.""
FNG_Post-Colonial_Chaos_3:0 "Post-Colonial_Chaos"
FNG_Post-Colonial_Chaos_3_desc:0 "Mantetsu's grip on Fengtian's politics, economy and infrastructure was choking, and now as its carefully laid systems and structures collapse, the country as a whole is utterly crippled. It will take a very long time to rebuild and reorganise."

### Informal Empire Mechanic ###
FNG_informal_empire_1:0 "Expel the Japanese Bandits!"
FNG_informal_empire_1_desc:0 "The time has come to declare our independence, drive the Japanese intruders from China, and end a century of unbearable national humiliation!"
FNG_informal_empire_2:0 "Preservation of the Xinhai Order"
FNG_informal_empire_2_desc:0 "Fengtian is the sole standing government upholding the order established by the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, which called for the overthrow of the Qing and the establishment of a Republic. This is the core of the government's legitimacy."
FNG_informal_empire_3:0 "Mantetsu Influence"
FNG_informal_empire_3_desc:0 "Mantetsu's economic influence spreads across the country and through the Assembly. While the government is committed to privately resisting, their efforts grow weaker by the day."
FNG_informal_empire_4:0 "Pervasive Mantetsu Influence"
FNG_informal_empire_4_desc:0 "Our factories rumble with activity, churning out weapons, supplies, and every-day conveniences at an astounding rate. None of this would be possible without Japan, but whispers of discontent abound. Foreigners have long exploited China."
FNG_informal_empire_5:0 "Mantetsu Dominance"
FNG_informal_empire_5_desc:0 "Japanese expertise and Mantetsu's influence propels Fengtian forward in ways previously thought impossible, but for all intents and purposes most meaningful control has passed from the hands of the Assembly to Japan. The Grand Marshal stands alone before Mantetsu's overwhelming power in the country."

### Focuses ###
FNG_Preservation_of_the_Xinhai_Order:0 "Preservation of the Xinhai Order"
FNG_Preservation_of_the_Xinhai_Order_desc:0 "Ironically, Fengtian is the sole national government upholding the order established by the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, which called for the overthrow of the Qing and the establishment of a Republic. Although its republican commitments are questionable, and Southern reclamation is currently unrealistic, the government has loudly advocated both goals, as they foster domestic legitimacy."
FNG_Fuguo_Qiangbing:0 "Fuguo Qiangbing"
FNG_Fuguo_Qiangbing_desc:0 "Translating roughly to 'Enrich the Nation, Strengthen the Army', this proverb dates back to pre-Han legalist philosophers, but has been used more recently to inspire reforms in both Guangxu Era China and Meiji Era Japan. Now it is applied again in Fengtian, as the government seeks to modernise and eventually strike South against the resurgent Qing Dynasty, and from there establish control over all China."
#Enrich the Nation Branch
FNG_Enrich_the_Nation:0 "Enrich the Nation"
FNG_Enrich_the_Nation_desc:0 "Manchuria's strength lies in its bountiful natural resources, characterised by Japanese publications as a 'boundless cornucopia', and its deposits of strategic resources like coal and iron have been designated as of "world-class significance". With a little Japanese help, Fengtian can forge for itself both a prosperous future and a mighty war-machine!"
#Mantetsu Collaboration Section
FNG_Mantetsu_Collaboration:0 "Mantetsu Collaboration"
FNG_Mantetsu_Collaboration_desc:0 "Mantetsu, also known as the 'South Manchuria Railway Company', exerts an enormous amount of control over our economy, with numerous subsidiaries ranging from flour mills to hospitals. Its aid will unfortunately be essential to developing most aspects of our economy that require Japanese technical expertise."
FNG_Yamato_Hotel_Licenses:0 "Yamato Hotel Licenses"
FNG_Yamato_Hotel_Licenses_desc:0 "One of Mantetsu's most successful ventures in Manchuria is its Yamato Hotel franchise, which serves the countless Japanese businessmen who make their way to and from the Home Islands every day. Despite the unwelcome influence they bear, their skills and capital are crucial."
FNG_The_Soy_Agricultural_Initiative:0 "The Soy Agricultural Initiative"
FNG_The_Soy_Agricultural_Initiative_desc:0 "Fengtian's significant Korean minority are skilled rice planters, but soybeans have become an extremely desirable cash crop, as they provide not only an excellent source of food, fertiliser, and animal feed, but also soy oil with industrial applications. Mantetsu undertook an effort to educate Koreans in Soy farming, but the response has been mixed. They now want our help to push this through."
FNG_Japanese_Electrical_Expertise:0 "Japanese Electrical Expertise"
FNG_Japanese_Electrical_Expertise_desc:0 "Thanks to China's backwardness over the past century, and the chaos of the past two decades, the country has few native engineers. Japanese assistance will be essential in bringing modernity to Manchuria."
FNG_Mantetsu_Research_Wing:0 "Mantetsu Research Wing"
FNG_Mantetsu_Research_Wing_desc:0 "Mantetsu's Research Wing, known as 'Mantetsu Chōsabu', serves as the centrepiece of Japan's colonial program, and pursues a wide variety of scientific goals. Its massive funding and talent pool could be of great use to us in our own efforts."
FNG_Mantetsu_Civil_Engineering_Projects:0 "Mantetsu Civil Engineering Projects"
FNG_Mantetsu_Civil_Engineering_Projects_desc:0 "While the Japanese have much to benefit directly from large civil engineering projects in Fengtian, they also do so indirectly by helping to present our regime as successful at improving the everyday lives of citizens. In this respect, our interests are mutually aligned."
#Crossover Section
FNG_Manufacture_Minsheng:0 "Manufacture Minsheng"
FNG_Manufacture_Minsheng_desc:0 "In late 1931 Zhang Zuolin's son, Xueliang, commissioned an American engineer to create China's first automotive vehicle, called 'Minsheng' or 'people's livelihood'. Fearing compeition to their own vehicles, the Japanese made efforts to interrupt and stall mass-production, but now after many years the pieces have finally fallen into place."
FNG_Fengtian_Society_for_Light_Metals:0 "Fengtian Society for Light Metals"
FNG_Fengtian_Society_for_Light_Metals_desc: "Significant deposits of Bauxite and Alunite have been known to exist in Liaoning for many years, but recent advances by Mantetsu sponsored laboratories in Fushun and Tokyo have enabled Aluminium production via a number of electro-chemical processes."
FNG_Yalu_and_Songhua_Hydroelectricity:0 "Yalu and Songhua Hydroelectricity"
FNG_Yalu_and_Songhua_Hydroelectricity_desc:0 "Manchuria's abundant coal deposits make for an excellent power source, but the strong currents of the Yalu and Songhua rivers could provide additional power at minimal expense. With Japanese expertise, we might harness these mighty rivers to power more homes and industry."
FNG_Japanese_Coal_Gasification_Methods:0 "Japanese Coal Gasification Methods"
FNG_Japanese_Coal_Gasification_Methods_desc:0 "Japan's quest for crucial oil lead it to Manchuria, but now with disappointing results from prospecting, coal gasification seems the only logical path forward. Though energy intensive, Fushun's enormous coal deposits could make the complex processes worthwhile."
FNG_Manchurian_Model_Cities:0 "Manchurian Model Cities"
FNG_Manchurian_Model_Cities_desc:0 "Japan sometimes goes to surprising lengths to portray its role in Fengtian as one of benevolent paternalism, to which end Mantetsu plans to install state of the art electrical, sewer, and tram systems in the major cities of Mukden, Yingkou, Changchun, and Harbin."
#Industrial Development Committee Section
FNG_Found_the_Northeast_IDC: "Found the Northeast IDC"
FNG_Found_the_Northeast_IDC_desc:0 "At Japanese recommendation, a proposal has been put forth to organise several influential businessmen and politicians into a body called the 'Northeastern Industrial Development Commission' that might guide Fengtian's industrial development."
FNG_Expand_the_Anshan_Mines:0 "Expand the Anshan Mines"
FNG_Expand_the_Anshan_Mines_desc:0 "The enormous iron deposits in Anshan have been described as being of 'world class significance', and churn out nearly 7 million tonnes of iron, with the potential to triple output by 1942. This expansion seems likely to propel Anshan toward becoming one of East Asia's largest industrial centres."
FNG_Establish_the_Jinzhou_Industrial_Zone:0 "Establish the Jinzhou Industrial Zone"
FNG_Establish_the_Jinzhou_Industrial_Zone_desc:0 "Jinzhou's docks and strategic position in the 'Liaoxi Corridor', which connects land transportation between North China and Northeast China, make it a prime target for government incentivised development. It remains to be seen whether special rules will be applied to this zone favouring Chinese or Japanese companies."
FNG_Expand_the_Fushun_Mines:0 "Expand the Fushun Mines"
FNG_Expand_the_Fushun_Mines_desc:0 "The mines around Fushun churn out nearly 11 million tons of coal per year, with deposits promising to produce over 4.5 billion tonnes total. While some modern trains and ships in the West use oil, the Japanese Empire runs on coal, and the strategic significance of these mines cannot be understated."
FNG_Yingkou_Commercial_Development:0 "Yingkou Commercial Development"
FNG_Yingkou_Commercial_Development_desc:0 "The port city of Yingkou serves as Fengtian's primary gateway to the world, and the second largest port on the Bohai Gulf after Japanese-controlled Dalian. The tremendous increase in material production in Fengtian demands an equally large investment in commercial infrastructure."
#Develop the Nine Provinces Section
FNG_Develop_the_Nine_Provinces:0 "Develop the Nine Provinces"
FNG_Develop_the_Nine_Provinces_desc:0 "The Nine Provinces of Manchuria, split from the original three, already contain over 30% of China's railroads and feature relatively widespread heavy industry, but if Fengtian is to move into the future these will have to be expanded upon and improved. Ideally this would be achieved solely by the Chinese people, but reality dictates that the Japanese will lead much of the path forward."
FNG_Reorganize_the_NTC:0 "Reorganise the NTC"
FNG_Reorganize_the_NTC_desc:0 "Founded by the Fengtian Government shortly after its creation, the National Transportation Commission serves as a planning board for infrastructure construction across the country. The Japanese allege that its foremost aim is to disrupt Mantetsu's operations, and there may be at least some truth to this claim."
#Resume the Wang Yongjiang Reforms Section
FNG_Resume_the_Wang_Yongjiang_Reforms:0 "Resume the Wang Yongjiang Reforms"
FNG_Resume_the_Wang_Yongjiang_Reforms_desc:0 "Zhang Zuolin's financial minister for many years, Wang Yongjiang, was almost singlehandedly responsible for the development of Manchuria from a weak borderland into one of China's most prosperous regions. Unfortunately he was taken from us some years ago, but his work and vision live on."
FNG_Reform_the_Civil_Service_Examination:0 "Reform the Civil Service Examination"
FNG_Reform_the_Civil_Service_Examination_desc:0 "In use for well over 2,000 years, the Imperial Civil Service Examination saw only minor reform during the later years of the Qing Dynasty, and is now desperately in need of review in order to form a capable and modern civil service for Fengtian."
FNG_Centralize_the_Banks:0 "Centralise the Banks"
FNG_Centralize_the_Banks_desc:0 "Fengtian currently features four note-issuing banks, namely the Bank of the Three Eastern Provinces, the Bank of Kirin, the Bank of Heilungkiang and the Frontier Bank, each of which are products of earlier centralisation efforts. Now it seems pertinent to complete this process and unify them all under a single Central Bank."
FNG_Re-Introduce_the_Fengtian_Dollar:0 "Re-introduce the Fengtian Dollar"
FNG_Re-Introduce_the_Fengtian_Dollar_desc:0 "The Fengtian Dollar was one of Wang Yongjiang's later experiments, and served as a currency un-backed by silver but still payable in tax, demonstrating the government's faith in its value but requiring no extra silver to print. Following enormous government expenditures during the Civil Wars and subsequent inflation, the currency was discontinued, but its flexibility could be useful today."
FNG_Support_Sino-Japanese_Joint_Companies:0 "Support Sino-Japanese Joint Companies"
FNG_Support_Sino-Japanese_Joint_Companies_desc:0 "A great number of businesses in Fengtian offer shares to both Chinese and Japanese, including the infamous Mantetsu, but relatively few Chinese have the funds to invest and as a result most joint companies are Japanese dominated. Government backing may permit us to provide means and incentives to fellow Chinese and gradually shift this balance."
FNG_Encourage_Chinese_Investment:0 "Encourage Chinese Investment"
FNG_Encourage_Chinese_Investment_desc:0 "Chinese investment is at the heart of our efforts to return at least some control of Fengtian's economy to its people, instead of Mantetsu. Incentives and careful planning are the only way forward."
FNG_Fill_the_Silver_Reserve:0 "Fill the Silver Reserve"
FNG_Fill_the_Silver_Reserve_desc:0 "The Fengtian Yuan, our principal currency, is backed by silver and in the past has even gained value against the Japanese Yen. This has been met by Japanese insistence that our reserves have never held enough silver to properly back the currency. Regrettably, there may have been some truth to this, and so more silver must be purchased if we are to attract additional investment."
FNG_Encourage_Japanese_Investment:0 "Encourage Japanese Investment"
FNG_Encourage_Japanese_Investment_desc:0 "Unfortunately foreign capital is crucial to our development efforts, and so we must make attempts to attract Japanese alongside Chinese investors. While they won't receive the same incentives as our own citizens, they should be comforted by our recent filling of the silver reserves."
#Political Branch
FNG_Courting_the_Grand_Marshals_Favour:0 "Courting the Grand Marshal's Favour"
FNG_Courting_the_Grand_Marshals_Favour_desc:0 "The Fengtian Government consists of several groups competing for the attention and favour of Grand Marshal Zhang Zuolin, around whom most state functions revolve. The Communications Clique and others in the assembly clamour for a constitution, while the generals call for a return to military rule, but Zhang may instead be able to quell the chaos and replace the squabbling factions with his own iron fist."
#Warlord Section
FNG_Revise_the_Military_Leadership:0 "Revise the Military Leadership"
FNG_Revise_the_Military_Leadership_desc:0 "For several years the military establishment has been divided between old and young factions, its more venerable members veterans of the Civil Wars, and its newer members trained at the Japanese Army War College. Serious conflict has emerged between them, and if progress is to be made, the Grand Marshal must pick a side."
FNG_Empower_the_Warlords:0 "Empower the Warlords"
FNG_Empower_the_Warlords_desc:0 "Until the foundation of the Republic, Zhang Zuolin never possessed complete control over the four provinces. Instead he exercised hegemony over a series of weaker warlords, who were later folded into the new government through a Japanese backed centralisation campaign. These Warlords now serve as Zhang's generals through a semi-feudal leadership structure, but their own ambitions remain."
FNG_The_Generals_Know_Best:0 "The Generals Know Best"
FNG_The_Generals_Know_Best_desc: "The corrupt politicians of the Assembly have allowed Fengtian to meander aimlessly for too long. Only the Grand Marshal and his generals are capable of leading the country forward. It takes the iron mettle of disciplined military men to resist temptations posed by the Japanese and other forces that seek to divide and weaken China!"
FNG_The_Jilin_Incident:0 "The Jilin Incident"
FNG_The_Jilin_Incident_desc:0 "It has become clear that the divide between the Old and Young Guard factions has only widened as a result of their recent ascent to power. Agents loyal to the government have determined that one of the factions is conducting an unexpected military buildup outside Songyuan in Jilin Province. This warrants investigation, and possibly decisive action."
FNG_Establish_the_Supreme_War_Council:0 "Establish the Supreme War Council"
FNG_Establish_the_Supreme_War_Council_desc:0 "With the military unified, and all political obstructions eliminated, the time is right for the establishment of a Supreme War Council to properly lay the foundation for China's prosperity and greatness. With this council of mighty generals at our head, the Fengtian government will be unstoppable!"
#Cult of Personality Section
FNG_A_Father_to_the_People:0 "A Father to the People"
FNG_A_Father_to_the_People_desc:0 "As part of centralisation efforts over the past decade, Zhang Zuolin has been portrayed by the government as a benevolent paternal figure guarding the Chinese people from backward Qing conservatism and western imperialist influences. Continuing this endeavour can only bolster our legitimacy."
FNG_Exalt_the_Grand_Marshal:0 "Exalt the Grand Marshal"
FNG_Exalt_the_Grand_Marshal_desc:0 "The generals and politicians squabble endlessly, and it has become clear that no progress can be made in the shadow of their incompetent leadership. The people, and the state, need guidance which can come from only once source. Let us exalt the Grand Marshal Zhang Zuolin!"
FNG_Formalize_the_Cult_of_Personality:0 "Formalise the Cult of Personality"
FNG_Formalize_the_Cult_of_Personality_desc:0 "We must redouble our efforts to rightfully portray our glorious leader as the man he truly is; a paragon and exemplar to all Chinese. Official state functions and propaganda efforts will be adjusted appropriately."
FNG_Proclaim_a_New_Mandate:0 "Proclaim a new Mandate"
FNG_Proclaim_a_New_Mandate_desc:0 "The people's resolve to do away with Qing regression and western imperialist influences has never been stronger, as exemplified in the Grand Marshal's proclamation today reducing the powers of the Assembly which has long been infested with scheming divisive elements."
FNG_There_is_only_the_Grand_Marshal:0 "There is only the Grand Marshal"
FNG_There_is_only_the_Grand_Marshal_desc:0 "It is time for the Grand Marshal, Zhang Zuolin, sun of China's future and beloved father of the Chinese people, to do away with internal disruptive forces and unite the country under a single banner! Ten thousand years to Grand Marshal Zhang!"
#Constitutional Section
FNG_Reorganize_the_Legislative_Polity:0 "Reorganise the Legislative Polity"
FNG_Reorganize_the_Legislative_Polity_desc:0 "The Assembly, cobbled together from the ashes of the Beiyang Government and other exiled groups from the South, has remained divided and largely impotent since its founding. Its various factions scramble to attract the Grand Marshal's favour, and thus gain a powerful piece in the political game."
FNG_Entrust_the_Assembly:0 "Entrust the Assembly"
FNG_Entrust_the_Assembly_desc:0 "Since the Xinhai Revolution nearly two decades ago, no democratic government in China has successfully drafted and adopted a constitution, and in order to gain the full support of the people in our efforts to retake the South we must entrust the Assembly with this important task."
FNG_The_Autumn_Program:0 "The Autumn Program"
FNG_The_Autumn_Program_desc:0 "On the heels of negotiations last Autumn, influential members of the Recovery League, Communications Clique, and Zhang Clique have set out a program outlining their intent to draft a Constitution. A key point of cooperation is a shared understanding that, without such measures, the government risks losing its way and will never hold the true support of the Chinese people."
FNG_The_Harbin_Convention:0 "The Harbin Convention"
FNG_The_Harbin_Convention_desc:0 "An effective constitution will only come as a product of a convention bringing together all of the major parties, and it goes without saying that some may attempt to disrupt the proceedings. The city of Harbin has been chosen to host the convention, given its long history as a multi-ethnic centre."
FNG_A_Resplendent_Republic:0 "A Reseplendent Republic"
FNG_A_Resplendent_Republic:0 "With the successful creation of a constitution satisfying at least the remaining major players in the government, it now merely needs to be adopted by the Assembly. Surely the way forward is now bright and clear for the Fengtian Government and the Republic of China. Long live democracy long live the Republic!"
#The Begonia Leaf
FNG_From_Beijing_to_the_Begonia_Leaf:0 "From Beijing to the Begonia Leaf"
FNG_From_Beijing_to_the_Begonia_Leaf_desc:0 "For decades, students and nationalists have compared the shape of China, that is to say China undivided, to the shape of a Begonia leaf. With Beijing in our hands, it has come time to reclaim all of our homeland, and make the Begonia Leaf a reality!"
#Strengthen the Army Branch
FNG_Strengthen_the_Army:0 "Strengthen the Army"
FNG_Strengthen_the_Army_desc:0 "During the Civil Wars, the Fengtian Army was utterly decimated as a consequence of intense fighting against more modern German equipment and defections by important generals, and the ensuing eight years have seen slow but steady rearmament and reorganisation in-pace with the recovering economy."
#Mukden National Academy Section
FNG_Found_the_Mukden_National_Academy:0 "Found the Mukden National Academy"
FNG_Found_the_Mukden_National_Academy_desc:0 "In the absence of formalised or even organised military instruction, Fengtian officers have long been sent to Japan for an education, and the cost of doing so is relatively prohibitive. As a result, and thanks to Japanese pressure, we have accepted Japanese officers into our lower ranks. This must end."
FNG_Expel_Japanese_Officers:0 "Expel Japanese Officers"
FNG_Expel_Japanese_Officers_desc:0 "Japan's influence over our military is unacceptable, we must expel their officers from our ranks. The cost of making such a move without sufficient replacements could be great, not to mention the diplomatic backlash, so we must make this move carefully."
#Japanese Instruction Column

Normally these matters would be handled by the local Xiangshen, landlords, retired officials, clan elders, and scholars who 'represent' peasants in meetings with county officials. On this occasion, however, a large collection of peasants have bypassed local authorities and are attempting to petition the government directly. Normally such a petition, unworthy of the central government's attention, would be brushed aside, but unfortunately the situation has attracted the attention of the Asahi Shimbun, a leftist Japanese newspaper. \n\n The local Xiangshen, believing this matter to be solely within their jurisdiction, request that they be allowed to settle the matter themselves, refuting accusations of favouritism and corruption by the peasants. On the one hand, throughout all of Chinese history the Central Government has never truly been able to exert influence over the Xiangshen, but on the other the peasants grow increasingly desperate, and the entire region is watching."

The situation is fairly similar, as the Xiangshen once again assert their authority, and the peasants demand increased control over their land and what happens on it. \n\n This petition, however, has double the signatures, and with the results of the last case fresh in their minds, other farmers begin to grumble."

fengtian.new.5.d:0 "It is unusual for members of the Recovery League to stray far from their usual statements about southern reclamation, or from the scripts prepared for them by deep-pocketed 'friends', but some more liberal minded members of the Assembly have received a landslide of peasant petitions regarding land reform, and have decided to champion their cause. They argue that if our republican government aims to truly embody the values of the Xinhai Revolution and to differentiate itself from the archaic Qing, it must satisfy the needs of the common people, and strip away the sort of feudalism that the Xiangshen represent. \n\n This group of vocal politicians remains a minority amid an otherwise indifferent Assembly, and advisers warn that the Xiangshen as a whole are not to be trifled with, but this decision ultimately lies in the Marshal's hands."

#Land Reform Event Conclusions
fengtian.new.6.t:0 "Peasant Unrest Quelled"
fengtian.new.6.d:0 "Given a taste of land reform, but denied its full flavor, unsatisfied peasants rose up in several northern villages, only to be put down by local garrisons. To add to the sad and embarrassing situation, the commander of a nearby Japanese brigade patrolling the Russian border decided to intervene, adding the impression that foreign influence was behind the crackdown, and that the central government is incapable of keeping order without outside assistance. \n\n This situation might have been handled better."
fengtian.new.6.a:0 "Damnable peasants!"
fengtian.new.7.t:0 "Widespread Peasant Unrest Quelled"
fengtian.new.7.d:0 "Given a taste of land reform, but denied its full flavor, unsatisfied peasants rose up across the north, overwhelming local garrisons and posing a threat to to the regional command at Qihihar. Fortunately the lightly armed farmers were poorly organised, lacking any kind of leadership structure, and so upon the full deployment of the regional general's forces, the attackers were dispersed and many slaughtered. \n\n Unfortunately, however, the loose discipline of the troops turned mere securing of towns into a looting frenzy, which was soon joined by nearby Japanese troops who apparently felt themselves 'under threat'. Our soldiers have been disciplined, but the damage has been done, and it is difficult to understate the current ill-will held toward the central government. The Xiangshen, smugly assured of their correctness all along, are happy to wait before re-asserting their authority to let the pain and embarrassment fully sink in."
fengtian.new.7.a:0 "What a disaster!"
fengtian.new.8.t:0 "Land Reform Underway"
fengtian.new.8.d:0 "For better or worse, land reform is now underway at both the local and national levels, with officials superseding the local Xiangshen to assert the central government's sovereignty for the first time in hundreds of years. However, while they have used that time to thoroughly game the machine of local administration, they were also its designers and engineers, forcing officials to proverbially re-invent the wheel. While many are satisfied, the economy is certain to suffer considerably, and it is unclear just how far the reforms will be able to go."
fengtian.new.8.a:0 "This is the price of progress"
#The Fate of Mantetsu Schooling
fengtian.new.9.t:0 "The Fate of Mantetsu Schooling"
fengtian.new.9.d:0 "Mantetsu has long maintained a series of privately run schools originally intended for the sons and daughters of employees, as well as Japanese immigrants, which pride themselves on providing an education comparable to or even exceeding those available in the Home Islands. At the Japanese government's behest, these schools were more recently opened to the paying public, clearly as part of an attempt to spread Japanese culture and norms. However, the schools are crucial to education, not only because many children of Fengtian's wealthy are enrolled, but also because they provide their services at no government cost. \n\n Any attempt to close the Mantetsu schools to the public will be met not only with Japanese outrage, but a state of educational chaos as we try to pick up the slack. While the civil service has undergone reforms, it remains questionable as to whether our economy and domestic educational staff will be up to the challenge."
fengtian.new.9.a:0 "Close the schools"
fengtian.new.9.b:0 "There is no choice"
fengtian.new.10.t:0 "The Kimono Scandal"
fengtian.new.10.d:0 "Scandal! In a most unfortunate turn of events, the Grand Marshal's youngest daughter has been photographed wearing a Japanese Kimono during a photo-session at the Mantetsu-run 'Hokutou Kunitachidaigaku' or 'Northeast National Academy'. Despite risk of arrest, word of the photo has already spread widely, along with a few copies of the image itself, though local and national news agencies know better than to print this defamation. Some agents in the military's intelligence branch speculate that the image was intentionally taken and spread by the Japanese as a means of punishing the government for recent actions, but no supporting evidence has emerged. \n\n There is little question, however, that the Qing will use this opportunity to spread their nefarious propaganda."
fengtian.new.10.a:0 "What an embarrassment!"

fengtian.new.11.t:0 "Students Join the Youth League"
fengtian.new.11.d:0 "In an embarrassing and deeply damaging incident, a band of Chinese school children from Changchun recently announced their intention to join the Fengtian Youth League, which actively promotes Japanese interests in our country. Obviously their young minds are easily impressionable, but their parade through the streets of their home city, waving Japanese flags, has disgusted many, and invited outright enmity toward themselves and the government. Parents weep, asking how their children could become so warped, and demand an alternative to these dangerous Japanese-run schools."

#NTC Railway Construction
fengtian.new.13.t:0 "Building the Jilin-Hailong Line"
fengtian.new.13.d:0 "With the reorganisation of the Northeast Transportation Committee complete, several new railways have been proposed for construction and, in some cases, completion. The first major project is the Jilin-Hailong Railway, originally planned in 1927, which met serious delays in construction due to the eruption of war in the south, and concerted Japanese attempts to stall it. The line has been operating in limited capacity since 1931, but remains incomplete, with both Mantetsu and a collection of smaller Chinese companies vying for the contract to continue building. The Japanese claim, and perhaps correctly, that they could have the railway complete in half the time due to their resources and expertise, but choosing a Chinese company would do a great deal to demonstrate Chinese strength and independence."
fengtian.new.13.a:0 "Choose a Chinese Company"

fengtian.new.14.t:0 "The Jilin-Hailong Line is Complete"
fengtian.new.14.d:0 "After months of construction and various unfortunate delays, the Jilin-Hailong line is finally complete, extending the reach of our main rail system into areas otherwise difficult to access. After some review of plans and available resources, the NTC will undoubtedly prepare to issue another contract."
fengtian.new.14.a:0 "Great news!"
fengtian.new.15.t:0 "Building the Changchun-Dailai Line"
fengtian.new.15.d:0 "The NTC's next major project, originally proposed by the Japanese to connect Mantetsu's smaller provincial lines with central lines running through major cities, the Changchun-Dalai line should serve to ease the movement of men and materials from North to South significantly. While the line does have Japanese origins and would serve to extend Mantetsu's reach, NTC planners nonetheless note its practical value. As before, Mantetsu offers to carry out the construction process themselves, but Chinese companies stand ready to perform the same task."

fengtian.new.16.t:0 "The Changchun-Dailai Line is Complete"
fengtian.new.16.d:0 "The new Changchun-Dailai line now stands as the most modern in China, taking full advantage of more recent technologies, and visually demonstrating the sheer gap in time between the older lines originating in the 1920s. Truly, the Chinese nation is moving toward a brighter future."
fengtian.new.16.a:0 "Excellent!"
fengtian.new.17.t:0 "Building the Taonan-Suolun Line"
fengtian.new.17.d:0 "The final of the NTC's more major construction projects is the Taonan-Suolun Line, which like other recent constructions, serves to connect major lines to otherwise difficult to reach areas. Unlike the previous line, however, this will connect directly to the Chinese Eastern Railway, theoretically keeping Mantetsu's creeping influence further from its operations. All the same, Mantetsu offers to construct the railroad, likely hoping to salvage at least something from the situation."
fengtian.new.17.a:0 "Choose a Chinese Company"
fengtian.new.17.b:0 "Choose Mantetsu"
fengtian.new.18.t:0 "The Taonan-Suolun Line is Complete"

fengtian.new.18.a:0 "Wansui!"
fengtian.new.19.t:0 "Railway Construction Workers Strike!"
fengtian.new.19.d:0 "Chinese workers, complaining of inadequate pay and difficult working conditions, have refused to return to work in a carefully coordinated strike. Despite the presence of railway unions in the Northeast, their coordination in this instance suggests the involvement of the Communications Clique, possibly as part of an attempt to demonstrate their influence or retaliate for some perceived slight. \n\n While this turn of events effects them too, the Japanese are happy to watch us squabble amongst ourselves. The strike will end, but not without causing significant delays."
fengtian.new.19.a:0 "Unfortunate"
fengtian.new.20.t:0 "Delays Plague Railway Construction"
fengtian.new.20.d:0 "The nature of the situation was fairly clear as soon as the first signs appeared; shipments that seemed to unaccountably go missing for several days on end, rails laid at just enough of an incorrect angle to require complete re-construction, and sudden inspections of the labour force by Japanese agents supposedly seeking 'dangerous criminals', inspections which inevitably required the suspension of work. \n\n These same tactics were employed by the Japanese during the 1920s against the Fengtian Clique's railway projects, attempting to slow and discredit Chinese railway construction in order to limit competition to Mantetsu, and now they seem to be delaying our efforts once again. Unfortunately, there is little we can do."
fengtian.new.20.a:0 "Frustrating"
fengtian.new.21.t:0 "Delays Plague Mantetsu Railway Construction"
fengtian.new.21.d:0 "Despite Mantetsu's excellent engineers and equipment, the current railway construction project has encountered repeated delays as workers unaccountably go missing, materials vanish in the night, and bandits raid the camps alongside the rails, only to disappear before Japanese troops arrive. \n\n The local police and our intelligence services are unwilling to do much to investigate or solve these repeated incidents, instead preferring to watch the Japanese squirm. The fact that Mantetsu received the contract to build the railway is well known to the public, and some patriotic citizens appear to have taken matters into their own hands."

fengtian.new.24.d:0 "The wars to the South left Fengtian destitute, bringing years of development and trust building in the economy to virtually nothing. If the Northeast is to prosper, and the Fengtian government is to reclaim the South, we will need substantial financial backing in the form of investment in key industries. Thanks to German support, the Qing economy has, so far, remained at least one step ahead of us, and the same level of support has previously been withheld by the Japanese due to concerns about our currency and the silver reserve backing it. \n\n However, with the reserve finally full and the Fengtian Yuan strong, sufficient incentives might be provided to encourage Japanese from the Home Islands to invest and help drive our economy. This will, of course, increase Japan's overall influence in the country, but some sacrifices must be made to support the inevitable National Reclamation War."

In all that time, however, it has never extended its tourist ambitions to the sea. \n\n A small group of wealthy investors from Tokyo now intend to buy out several of local shipping companies and establish a water-borne alternative to Mantetsu's railway tourism, while performing shipping services on the side, thus creating 'Bohai Waterborne Enterprises'."

Mantetsu's Research Wing has made great strides in making its growing, processing, and use more efficient, but planting percentages across Fengtian remain relatively stagnant. Korean farmers, who make up the majority of immigrants to Manchuria, are excellent rice planters, and in addition to many Chinese prefer to plant crops they have more experience with instead of Soy. \n\n In an attempt to change this, Mantetsu began the Soy Agricultural Initiative, a plan intending to educate farmers and incentivise the production of soy as a cash crop, but it has so far been poorly received. Mantetsu hopes to gain the government's support in promoting the initiative, which would almost certainly increase soy yields and therefore long term profits."

fengtian.new.47.d:0 "A representative from Mantetsu's Research Wing has come forward with a proposal, the acceptance of which he assures the government is in its best interest, but which he insists must be kept completely secret. Apparently, following the Drought of 1939, Mantetsu brought together farming experts, senior officials from agricultural organisations, and academic scholars with relevant expertise in order to lead an initiative with the aim of improving agricultural efficiency and production in Fengtian. After months of testing, one of several research teams created a solution based upon farming methods used in Hokkaido, which might allow the average Chinese family to farm ten entire hectares of land without needing to hire seasonal workers, thus improving production and freeing up labour for factories in Anshan, Fushun, and Mukden. The Mantetsu official indicates that these methods should be spread through the dissemination of informational leaflets and Chinese instructors, themselves trained by Japanese experts, and he seemed to stress the idea that this project should be disassociated in every possible way from the South Manchurian Railway. \n\n After some investigation, the Army's intelligence section has determined that the Kwantung Army refused to support Mantetsu's efforts for unclear reasons, suggesting that the two factions may be competing, or that this is simply a part of some elaborate Japanese ruse. The relatively liberal officials in Mantetsu's research wing and other bureaucratic roles have been known to clash with the conservative Kwantung Army."

General Kekichi Ueda himself is said to have stormed into the office of the Mantetsu president, Yosuke Matsuoka, and delivered a thunderous verbal barrage regarding the necessity to keep Fengtian dependent upon Japanese aid. The Kwantung Army's ability to punish Mantetsu is ultimately limited, as the powerful company is practically autonomous, but there's little doubt that the Army will go out of its way to make things difficult for everyone involved.

Further complicating matters for Fengtian are the Japanese, who would gladly rush into fill any authority ceded by the state. As such, the Government walks a political tightrope between an archaic past and an uncertain future, pushed forward only by creeping necessity and the insecurity it otherwise bears. \n\n Fengtian's path to reform is buttressed by the twin columns of economic and military change, the individual components of which may not be problematic in themselves, but which together may pose risks if pursued independently of political reform, and the necessary involvement of the Japanese threatens to sweep the state's thin veneer of legitimacy out from under its feet. The waters ahead are treacherous, and it will take a truly great helmsman to steer the ship of state not only to survival, but also toward the reclamation of the Chinese nation."

fengtian.new.54.t:0 "Enrich the Nation"
fengtian.new.54.d:0 "While Manchuria's resources are rich and diverse, and Fengtian stands as the third greatest industrial centre in East Asia, its economy remains plagued by a number of structural problems, the symptoms of which cripple the state and slow progress toward Southern Reclamation. Fengtian's biggest investor is the state itself, feeding tax revenues back into key sectors such as steel, coal, and soybean production. Yet, the Japanese and Mantetsu trail the government only marginally in this regard, and invest far more widely, giving them an unquestioned grip upon both Fengtian's economy and society. \n\n While the extent of this grip grows by the day, reform could serve to increase the government's revenues through the suppression of otherwise endemic corruption, the creation of a healthier environment for private investment, and the unfortunate but necessary cooperation with Mantetsu in key areas like infrastructure and technology. So long as the government can maintain political autonomy, and at least a majority of control over the economy, it can pursue initiatives to contest Japanese influence, retain legitimacy in the eyes of the Chinese people, and eventually achieve its core goals. \n\n It should be noted that while Japan has a vested interest in seeing us succeed relative to the Qing, they will only provide assistance with specific efforts aiming to move past our backward industry, even as they attempt to widen their already worrying influence over our economy."

fengtian.new.55.t:0 "Strengthen the Army"
fengtian.new.55.d:0 "The Fengtian Army, officially the Army of the Republic, is an impressive sight by most Chinese standards, though pales in comparison to most foreign forces, and has only recently recovered much of its strength after its decimation in the Civil Wars. The majority of Fengtian's weapons and vehicles are outdated, even including its standard issue rifle provided by the Japanese, and organisation below the division level is a patchy affair due to limited communications equipment. The Army's greatest deficiency is in morale, partially as a consequence of foreign-trained and even outright Japanese officers widespread throughout the ranks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Fengtian Flying Corps, officially The China Flying Corps, is the pride and joy of the Grand Marshal's oldest son, Zhang Xueliang, who used his passion for aviation to train its first pilots. The Flying Corps performed well during the Civil Wars, and lost air superiority over the Zhili only upon the arrival of modern German-piloted planes. Since then, the Flying corps has grown slightly, though its planes remain over a decade behind the European standard. \n\nOverall, Fengtian's forces lag behind those of the Qing, and remain heavily dependent upon Japanese equipment and aid. This aid, and whatever Fengtian can do to become self-sufficient, will be crucial to narrowing that gap and eventually reclaiming the south."

fengtian.new.56.d:0 "Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Fengtian, known as the 'Three Eastern Provinces' during the Qing and Beiyang periods, were split into nine smaller sub-divisions in 1931 to aid governance and economic planning. The vast majority of Fengtian's industry and mineral wealth is concentrated in the South, while the central and Northern provinces are primarily agricultural. Jehol, to the Southwest of Fengtian Province, remained untouched by the reorganisation, but has suffered thanks to the end of rail traffic through the Liaoxi Corridor, which connected land transportation between Zhili and the Northeast. Thanks to the government's new initiatives incentivising development across the provinces, prosperity will surely increase, but serious structural issues remain, and may become problematic as a result of increasing disparity in development between the north and south."

fengtian.new.57.d:0 "At the start of the 20th century, Manchuria was a poorly managed frontier, fraught by lawlessness and banditry. With the rule of Zhang, however, came rapid reforms through his finance minister Wang Yongjiang. Wang backed his currency, originally no different from those printed by other warlords, with silver, generating confidence and eventually gaining value against the Japanese Yen. Extensive tax reform solved outstanding debts, and by the early 1920s the economy was bolstered by immigrants fleeing instability throughout the rest of China. The presence of Mantetsu, the South Manchurian Railway Company, permitted Japan to invest heavily and confidently throughout Manchuria, building railways, mines, and even schools and hospitals across their extensive land granted via treaty. \n\n This period of prosperity, and even relative peace, came to an end when Zhang took his forces headlong into the Civil Wars raging to the south, and defeats there came at a cost to Fengtian's economy. The fighting eventually brought the economy to the brink of collapse, and while this was by no means as bad as it could have been, the untimely death of Minister Wang made prospects of rapid recovery unrealistic. With Fengtian's economy only beginning to recover from eight years of post-war decline, the time has come to implement new reforms, inspired by those of the old, and return the Northeast to its rightful place as one of China's most prosperous regions."

All the same, while treaty rights permit Japanese to reside and engage in business and manufacture of any kind, construction still theoretically requires approval from the local governor and, if necessary, the Grand Marshal himself. Mantetsu aims to build a series of new hotels, all of which will inevitably become hubs for further Japanese activity, and while construction could never be stopped without angering the Japanese government, limits might be imposed to forestall Japanese influence in certain areas. Unfortunately, as much as they may stand as physical edifices to Japan's strength, the hotels are frequented by the Japanese elite and many Mantetsu employees, making them crucial for the rapid development we desire."

Serving to oversee and direct the development of Fengtian's industry, mostly through the allocation of funds and leases, the commission now faces the question of its composition. The Concordia Association has proposed the inclusion of a series of extremely talented individuals with experience working for the Nissan and Mitsubishi Zaibatsu in Japan, who stress the need for an export driven economy taking advantage of Fengtian's existing natural resources, while the Grand Marshal's generals insist upon the necessity of an 'Army First' approach to development, and are using their considerable influence to ensure the placement of military men on the commission. The Communications Clique, meanwhile, recommends their own presence on the commission and advocate a mixed developmental approach, referencing their long experience with business dealings across China, as well as more recently here in the Northeast. \n\n Unfortunately, a compromise involving all three parties is practically impossible, as a clear vision is necessary for the task, and intra-commission bickering would almost certainly render it functionally impotent. It should be noted that, although the commission's nature as an appointed body permits the presence of Japanese in its makeup, the public and much of the Assembly will likely react negatively to their presence. At the same time, the Japanese will not appreciate exclusion."

The result is a surprisingly liberal and open minded intellectual community, which sometimes goes insofar as to place scientific inquiry before nationalistic concerns. \n\n This appears to be one of those instances, as our government has been approached by a Chosabū representative offering future assistance in one of several technological fields, having convinced Kesago Nakajima, the leader of the Japanese Military Mission to Fengtian, that this move will improve our overall prosperity and readiness to defeat the Qing.

Some ministers have confidentially suggested only buying about half of the desired quantity, as many suggested was the case prior to the civil wars, but those rumours were never confirmed despite the significant economic recession that followed the government's inability to settle its war debts. \n\n Filling the reserve inadequately would certainly be a big risk, but perhaps a worthwhile one."

Japanese officers in particular are known to prize any station in Fengtian, the devalued currency allowing them to live lives of relative luxury, and hire servants for most menial tasks, earning them the enmity of not only their fellows but also the local population. \n\n Now, with the founding of the Mukden National Academy, these officers have taken the opportunity to mock the academy's current accommodations, specifically a former fabric factory near central Mukden.

fengtian.new.101.d:0 "An old proverb says: 'Virtue never lacks company; it will ever find support.' The forces of justice will rise, and men of goodwill ultimately co-operate in the interests of rectitude. There is little question that the regressive and illegitimate Qing government stands in the way of progress, oppressing and subjugating the Chinese people, and I have received every assurance that our allies will stand with us to end this injustice. On our part, we should hold fast to our stand and fix our eyes steadfastly on our goal, and be firm in our determination. The entire Northeast should carry on with oneness of heart. The final victory will be ours. I urge my ministers, our army, and our people to redouble their efforts in order to attain success. \n\n It is in this spirit, that I proclaim the beginning of the Year of Righteous Effort, a full three hundred and sixty five days of strenuous national effort, from which we shall emerge as a force unstoppable in the pursuit of our goal. And, when this year is done, the Five Color Flag will fly high again in Beijing, and the Qing government will be nothing but ash in the winds of history. Ten thousand years to the Republic!

Their mission will not be easy, as any number of things could go wrong, but if they are successful we will have an uprising behind Qing lines to keep them busy and cut their supply."

fengtian.new.105.d:0 "Word has reached our intelligence operatives that, in the process of infiltration through Shanhaiguan, our soldiers were discovered and picked off by Qing operatives and groups of military police. If anyone is left, they will undoubtedly be too scattered and disorganized to be of any use once we begin the war, and so unfortunately this plan must be considered failed."

fengtian.new.106.d:0 "Although our intelligence services received reports of progress through the beginning stages of the Shanhaiguan Infiltration, contact has been abruptly cut off, and our forces have disappeared South of the Great Wall.

fengtian.new.108.t:0 "An Unexpected Advantage"
fengtian.new.108.d:0 "Despite the cessation of all contact with the Shanhaiguan infiltration force, reports have made their way north of gunfire and chaos on the northern banks of the Chaobai River. It seems that these heroes have avoided all detection, only to strike now at the opportune moment. Truly, this is an unexpected advantage, and we must push south before they are overwhelmed by the Qing response and greater numbers!"

fengtian.new.109.a:0 "Damn"

fengtian.new.110.t:0 "The Gang of Three"
fengtian.new.110.d:0 "As a loose coalition of fallen generals, governors, bureaucrats, and politicians exiled from the South by the collapse of the Beiyang Government and the return of the Qing, the Recovery League is widely acknowledged to be susceptable to corruption. Recent discoveries by police, however, suggest this is operating on a level so far unheard of. It seems as if a group of Recovery League members, who were made mayors of townships in Jilin for their experience with governing in the South, were in fact never governors at all; killing and replacing their namesakes, and through a complicated plot of deceit, fooling the authorities while eliminating any who might contradict them. \n\n The web of lies, corruption, and murder necessary to sustain this falsehood stretches across the whole of the Northeast, and the damage dealt to the government's legitimacy is not inconsiderable."
fengtian.new.110.a:0 "Disgusting"

fengtian.new.111.t:0 "Mantetsu Bribes"
fengtian.new.111.d:0 "A pair of Concordia Association members were recently caught attempting to bribe members of the Recovery League, and while this activity has long been suspected, this is the first time it has been caught in the open. Although members of the other parties have motioned to remove the offending members, the Japanese Consulate has already delivered a message 'strongly advising' that no action be taken against the members of the Concordia Association. \n\n The Grand Marshal could choose to remove them regardless, but not without a significant cost."

fengtian.new.112.t:0 "The Anshan Incident"
fengtian.new.112.d:0 "The iron ore deposits at Anshan have been worked by a Japanese-owned subsidiary of Mantetsu since 1918, known as “Anshan Iron and Steel”, serving as one of Japan’s most valuable sources of steel outside the Home Islands. When the facilities were first constructed most of the ore required little digging, as the deposits lie close to the surface, but as of the current date more extensive excavation is required to continue operations. The company has begun this expansion work without acquiring a lease for the extra land from the local authorities, destroying several farm properties in the process, and despite promises neither compensation nor the lease have been forthcoming. \n\n Protests quickly broke out among local farmers over the issue, and quickly escalated into a riot that severely damaged expensive mining equipment, which our police refused to prevent, citing the technically illegal nature of the operations. On its own initiative, a nearby Japanese garrison from Anshan stepped in, and used lethal force to disperse the riot. This slaughter of our citizens has not gone unnoticed, and existing anti-Japanese sentiment has only been inflamed. The people will hold us accountable in our response, but the deposits and the company working them are essential to Japan’s strategic goals, and our relationship with the Japanese permits little room to manoeuvre."
fengtian.new.112.a:0 "Denounce the Japanese"
fengtian.new.112.b:0 "Stay silent"

fengtian.new.113.t:0 "Japan Denounces Us"
fengtian.new.113.d:0 "Describing our denouncement of their conduct during the recent Anshan Incident as 'insolent' and 'unbefitting of Japanese generosity', the Japanese government issued a scathing rebuke both publicly and through a letter delivered directly by the Japanese Consul General in Mukden. The Kwantung Garrison performed a series of motorised and armoured manoeuvres in full view of the capital, their message clear. Any escalation of this situation would undoubtedly result in further rebukes to which we can make no meaningful response. "
fengtian.new.113.a:0 "So be it"
fengtian.new.113.b:0 "We will not be intimidated!"

fengtian.new.114.t:0 "Imperial Han Society Killings"
fengtian.new.114.d:0 "The Imperial Han Society, a secret society with a Han-chauvinistic ideology and uncompromising hate of other ethnicities, is believed to be behind a number of killings in Mukden, Changchun, and Harbin. The targets appear to be more or less random, linked only by their status as ethnic Russians, Manchu, Koreans, and Japanese. Mantetsu and the Japanese Consulate are demanding investigations, and the Kempeitai have already carted away a number of suspects to an unknown fate."
fengtian.new.114.a:0 "Imperial Han lives in the past"

fengtian.new.115.t:0 "The Grand Marshal Radio Incident"
fengtian.new.115.d:0 "In what has come to be known as 'The Grand Marshal Radio Incident', a Qing subversive was able to record a frank conversation between the Grand Marshal and his generals, and transmitted it over widely used frequencies in Mukden for nearly fourty minutes before being jammed by a nearby Mantetsu owned station. The conversation, in which the Grand Marshal described "enemies to the North, South, East, and West", puts Fengtian's relations with Japan in unconventionally blunt terms damaging to our propaganda and Japan's interests. \n\n The broadcast was doubly damaging thanks to its capture of Zhang discussing the realities of Qing's relative industrial and military strength, and the degree to which we must rely on the Japanese for crucial technology, something which we have been careful to conceal from the public."
fengtian.new.115.a:0 "The truth is not pretty"

fengtian.new.116.t:0 "Seditious Articles Proliferate"
fengtian.new.116.d:0 "An article in the Nihon Kogyō Shimbun, or 'Japan Industrial Newspaper', has been translated into Chinese and spread widely in local newspapers before censorship officials managed to track and shut down the publisher. The article described in substantial detail the extensive degree to which Mantetsu and other Japanese companies have established control over most sectors of our economy, and set a forecast predicting near complete control within five years time. For obvious reasons, the article has been deeply upsetting to the general population, and there is little we can do to prevent the existing copies circulating."
fengtian.new.116.a:0 "Disgraceful!"

fengtian.new.117.t:0 "Honghuzi Attacks in Heilongjiang"
fengtian.new.117.d:0 "Honghuzi, translating literally to 'Red Beards', are groups of bandits and robbers that have long plagued the Northeast. While the Grand Marshal's Pacification and Centralisation campaign after the Civil Wars reduced their number, there have been attacks in the years since. Now several farmsteads in southern Heilongjiang were set alight, and their occupants robbed of valuables."
fengtian.new.117.a:0 "Unfortunate"

fengtian.new.118.t:0 "Honghuzi Attacks in Xing'an"
fengtian.new.118.d:0 "The Honghuzi have struck again, this time in Xing'an, raiding farmers and traders along its major roads. The local governor has dispatched his garrison to guard against future incursions, but the rough terrain and the bandit's elusive nature suggests that they will simply strike again elsewhere."
fengtian.new.118.a:0 "Damn bandits!"

fengtian.new.119.t:0 "Honghuzi Attacks in Liaobei"
fengtian.new.119.d:0 "The Honghuzi have grown particularly bold, leading attacks into Liaobei province, and even venturing to the borders of Jilin before derailing a local train and robbing its occupants, including a number of Japanese citizens. The local authorities have apologized profusely for this embarassment, and additional guards have been posted on nearby trains, but the Japanese Consulate has already demanded compensation from our government for the property lost."
fengtian.new.119.a:0 "Damn"

fengtian.new.120.t:0 "The Manchurian Youth League"
fengtian.new.120.d:0 "The Manchurian Youth League has existed as a general association for Mantetsu employees and other Japanese residents in the Northeast for several years, but the recent attacks by bandits has lead it to issue a statement on the matter, calling on the Japanese Government to better protect its citizens, and demanding a greater degree of control over our government. \n\n Of course, the immediate impact will likely be minimal, but if the Youth League continues its efforts, it could turn some heads in Tokyo."
fengtian.new.120.a:0 "Unfortunate"

fengtian.new.121.t:0 "Creeping Mantetsu Influence"
fengtian.new.121.d:0 "As it has done for years, Mantetsu continues its slow but sure efforts to dominate our economy, investing in businesses, buying others up, and diversifying across the industrial sector. \n\nGiven enough time, it seems as if the whole country might be swallowed up, unless a final and decisive break is made with Japan."
fengtian.new.121.a:0 "This must be resisted"

fengtian.new.122.t:0 "The Generals Grow Restless"
fengtian.new.122.d:0 "Worried by their diminishing influence in the Assembly, and throughout the government, powerful members among the Zhang Clique have begun voicing their discontent, claiming that if they so desired, the entire assembly could be dissolved in minutes by force of arms. These statements have been reinforced by a slow but steady increase in the capital's garrison, which would almost certainly overwhelmingly side with their patron generals in the event of any political upheaval."
fengtian.new.122.a:0 "Worrying"

fengtian.new.123.t:0 "Railway and Telegraph Mysteries"
fengtian.new.123.d:0 "Ministers and other government officials have strangely found themselves immensely inconvenienced as of late, with telegrams going missing or relayed to the wrong people, secrets uttered only over the telephone suddenly becoming public, and trains mysteriously arriving chronically late. Of course, most are well aware that this is merely the Communications Clique showing its discontent with its recent diminishing influence, and it seems likely that these measures it has taken will reinforce its necessity to the government's effective functioning."
fengtian.new.123.a:0 "Such is politics"

fengtian.new.124.t:0 "Heinous Assassination in Mukden!"
fengtian.new.124.d:0 "On his way to government offices, a member of the Communications Clique was gunned down in public by what appears to be a Qing loyalist, recruited from among the Northeast's Manchu population! The Qing have been known to recruit spies and assassins before, but some rumors suggest that this assassin was instead hired by members of the Concordia Association, locked in conflict with the Communications Clique's Railway and Telegraph barons for control of the country's infrastructure."
fengtian.new.124.a:0 "A terrible loss"

fengtian.new.125.t:0 "Record Mantetsu Profits"
fengtian.new.125.d:0 "The South Manchuria Railway Company, colloquially Mantetsu, has long dominated large sectors of Fengtian's economy, and in turn acts as Japan's primary means of influence over our government. While this influence is unwelcome, it brings crucial capital and technology without which the Grand Marshal could never hope to retake China. \n\n The Company has today announced record profits, much of which goes to Japan's government in the form of tax revenue."
fengtian.new.125.a:0 "Is this a necessary evil?"

fengtian.new.126.t:0 "Counterfeit Dollars Spread"
fengtian.new.126.d:0 "In order to save money, the version of the Fengtian Dollar being circulated currently is the same as it was when it was first issued, as quality printing equipment is highly expensive. This seems to have left the currency open to forgery, however, and already there are believed to be thousands of fake Fengtian dollars circulating."
fengtian.new.126.a:0 "They will be caught eventually"

fengtian.new.127.t:0 "The Lavrov Affair"
fengtian.new.127.d:0 "With the spread of Soviet control across much of Russia, a circumspect fellow calling himself only 'Lavrov' has appeared at the border-town of Heihe in Heilongjiang, requesting asylum. In return, he's offering partial blueprints and documentation for one of Russia's more recent aircraft designs, which he claims to be the rightful owner of, but which seems more likely to be stolen. \n\n Accepting could risk a diplomatic incident if Russia regains control of its Far East, and Transamur has already lodged a request for custody of Lavrov, as we recognize them as the legitimate Russian Government. On the other hand, this could be a lucky opportunity to develop our own aircraft technology without reliance on Japan."
fengtian.new.127.a:0 "Grant him asylum"
fengtian.new.127.b:0 "Hand him over to Transamur"
fengtian.new.127.c:0 "Send him back"

fengtian.new.128.d:0 "Grand Marshal Zhang of the Fengtian Government has proclaimed that, within a year, his nation will begin its War of National Reclamation to retake the South and reunite the country under his leadership. Of course, our aid has played a great role in getting Fengtian to where it is today, and already some of the Grand Marshal's underlings have suggested that we might assist their final preparations. \n\n This would be in our interest, as Fengtian is the best means of pushing German influence out of China, but at the same time it might be best to limit their ambitions. The Grand Marshal will, of course, push on regardless. His legitimacy depends on it."

Soon, the world will no longer be able to ignore our right to be recognized as the sole legitimate government! Unfortunately, our Japanese allies also took part in the fighting around Beijing, and have already begun organizing a victory parade through Tiannanmen Square. The local IJA commander has extended an invitation, but with a tardiness that seems all too deliberate, and our troops will have to rush to prepare. \n\n Some of our generals are already suggesting that we prevent the Japanese from holding their parade or organize our own later, as Beijing is ultimately our capital and this is our day of glory. Other more diplomatic members of the Cabinet and Assembly are proposing that we accept the invitation, most prominently members of the Concordia Association."

The local IJA commander has extended an invitation, but with a tardiness that seems all too deliberate, and our troops will have to rush to prepare. The Concordia Association, which has a great deal of influence in our government, makes taking a hard-line stance difficult, though we could probably convince our local commanders to snub the occasion.

The local IJA commander who lead the assault on the capital has already begun organizing a victory parade, and kindly invited nearby Fengtian divisions to participate. However, in an act of unparalleled impertinence, the Fengtian Government has not only refused our offer but actively impeded our own parade claiming that this is 'their day of glory' and not our own! \n\n We could issue an immediate statement, cutting aid from Fengtian, but they do remain our allies, and the war continues unabated."

Privately, Mantetsu's President has indicated that the studio will also be used to subtly spread anti-Qing messages, but this has left some close advisors to the Grand Marshal wondering what else might be subtly inserted. \n\n The government could always instruct Jilin's governor to deny Mantetsu permission to build, but the Film Association would likely just move south to Dairen, where we will have no influence over it at all."

fngpolitic.15.d_Wu:0 "Feeling confident in their growing influence in government, the Recovery League has proposed Wu Jinglian, former speaker of the Beiyang Assembly, as a replacement for our current Minister of Foreign Affairs. Wu has served in the position before, and is known for his fierce opposition to the regressive Qing monarchy, though he has also been an outspoken critic of Japanese involvement in China. As a result, he could be a vital asset in the propaganda war against Qing, or a substantial inconvenience in our complicated relationship with Japan. \n\n Wu's extant ties to the Foreign Ministry and its importance to the Recovery League means that they will fight hard to ensure he gets the position, but the final decision rests with the Grand Marshal."
fngpolitic.15.d_Chang:0 "Feeling confident in their growing influence in government, the Recovery League has proposed Chang Chun, a prominent politician with close ties to Huang Fu and the late Dr Sun Yat-sen, as a replacement for our current Minister of Foreign Affairs. Having studied at the Tokyo Shinbu Gakko before the Revolution, Chang can be said to have a working understanding with the Japanese while still remaining distant from the Concordia Society, making him especially well suited to manage the complicated relationship between our two governments. \n\n The Recovery League's ties to the Foreign Ministry means that they will fight hard to ensure he gets the position, but the Grand Marshal can veto the decision at any time."
fngpolitic.15.d_Huang:0 "Feeling confident in their growing influence in government, the Recovery League has proposed Huang Fu, former Speaker of the Assembly, as a replacement for our current Minister of Foreign Affairs. His reputation as a man of character makes him well suited to to the task, but his resolute republican values have made his relationship with the Grand Marshal one of cooperation against mutual enemies, and he will undoubtedly react poorly to further consolidation of the Grand Marshal's already sweeping powers. \n\n Huang's prominence and the Foreign Ministry's importance to the Recovery League means that they will fight hard to ensure he gets the position, but the final decision will be made by the Grand Marshal."
fngpolitic.15.d_Huang_hog: "Feeling confident in their growing influence in government, the Recovery League has proposed Huang Fu, our current Speaker of the Assembly and Head of Government, as a replacement for our current Minister of Foreign Affairs. It is not unheard of for especially powerful politicians and warlords to consolidate power through occupying multiple posts, and his reputation as a man of character makes him well suited to deflect suspicion and accusations of misappropriated power. All the same, his resolute republican values have made his relationship with the Grand Marshal one of cooperation against mutual enemies, and he will undoubtedly react poorly to further consolidation of the Grand Marshal's already sweeping powers. \n\n Huang's prominence and the Foreign Ministry's importance to the Recovery League means that they will fight hard to ensure he gets the position, but the final decision will be made by the Grand Marshal."

fngpolitic.17.d_Pan:0 "With the Foreign Ministry firmly under their control, the Recovery League has set its sights on the office of the Economic Minister, proposing Pan Fu as a replacement for its current occupant. Pan is known to be an experienced in the role, having served both under the Beiyang Government and our own, but during that time he built up an unfortunate reputation for shady dealings and corruption. He has yet to be convicted of any crime, and it's even possible that these widely held suspicions are unfounded, but his past seems likely to haunt him if he reoccupies his old post. \n\n Despite the risk, the Recovery League's advantage in government means that only the Grand Marshal can prevent his appointment."
fngpolitic.17.d_Chang:0 "With the Foreign Ministry firmly under their control, the Recovery League has set its sights on the office of the Economic Minister, proposing Chang Chun as a replacement for its current occupant. Chang has relatively little experience with fiscal and financial matters, leading most to suspect that his nomination is more a product of intra-party politics than one based on merit. Despite this, Chang remains a respected politician, and the Recovery League's strong position in government means that only the Grand Marshal himself can stand in the way of his appointment."

Unfortunately Chang has relative little experience suiting him to the task, and his nomination alongside his extant role as Minister of Foreign Affairs seems to be evidence of his growing power within the party more than any particular fiscal or financial merit.

Wu Jinglian is a curious choice, in large part because of his simultaneous role as Foreign Minister, but also because has has virtually no experience readying him for the task. The Recovery League's choice is likely a product of intra-party politics, but might allow Wu to coordinate the Foreign Ministry and Intelligence Services in a way previously made difficult by political differences between the ministries. \n\nThe decision of whether or not to appoint Wu lies with the Grand Marshal."
fngpolitic.19.a:0 "Appoint Wu"
fngpolitic.19.b:0 "Refuse the appointment"

fngpolitic.24.t:0 "The Communications Clique Nominates a New Economic Minister"
fngpolitic.24.d_Lu:0 "Thanks to their growing strength in government, the Communications Clique has nominated Lu Ronghuan to fill the position of Economic Minister. A native of Fengtian province, Lu oversaw the sale of Transamur's portion of the Chinese Eastern Railway to Fengtian in 1927, and has been Chairman of the Board ever since, marking him as a significant figure of opposition to Mantetsu while conveniently allowing him to amass a great deal of personal wealth. \n\nThe Communications Clique's extensive connections to the Commerce and Financial Ministries makes this appointment relatively easy, and the transition smooth, leaving the Grand Marshal with the sole choice of whether or not to approve the appointment."
fngpolitic.24.d_Li:0 "Thanks to their growing strength in government, the Communications Clique has nominated Li Shaogeng to fill the position of Economic Minister. Granted the role of Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway in 1929, Li has never been particularly outspoken or charistmatic, but maintains an intricate network of back-channels and secret agreements across with low level officials and bureaucrats across the Northeast. His most important relationships, however, are with the railway unions, which work with the Communications Clique to oppose Mantetsu and Japanese influence in return for rights, benefits, and control over the workplace. \n\nLi is known to be silently competent, but the Grand Marshal can always choose to prevent the appointment."

### Informal Empire Mechanic ###
fengtian.informalempire.1.t:0 "Expel the Japanese Bandits!"
fengtian.informalempire.1.d:0 "The time has come to declare our independence, drive the Japanese intruders from China, and end a century of unbearable national humiliation! We will naturally be deprived of foreign material support, but the Chinese people now rally behind us. Onward! Zhonghua Mingguo Wansui!"
fengtian.informalempire.1.a:0 "Wansui!"
fengtian.informalempire.2.t:0 "Preservation of the Xinhai Order"
fengtian.informalempire.2.d:0 "Fengtian is the sole standing government upholding the order established by the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, which called for the overthrow of the Qing and the establishment of a Republic. Although some say that our republican commitments are questionable, and full scale war against the restored Qing is currently unrealistic, the government loudly advocates both goals, as they foster legitimacy in the eyes of all Chinese."
fengtian.informalempire.2.a:0 "Defend the revolutionary values!"
fengtian.informalempire.3.t:0 "Mantetsu Influence"
fengtian.informalempire.3.d:0 "Mantetsu's economic influence spreads across the country and through the assembly. While the government is, for now, committed to privately resisting, their efforts seem to grow weaker by the day."
fengtian.informalempire.3.a:0 "A necessary evil?"
fengtian.informalempire.4.t:0 "Pervasive Mantetsu Influence"
fengtian.informalempire.4.d:0 "Our factories rumble with activity, churning out weapons, supplies, and every-day conveniences at an astounding rate. None of this would be possible without Japan, but whispers of discontent abound. Who are we fighting for, China or Japan? Is the Republic really being strengthened, or instead brought to its knees by foreign exploitation? Is this truly necessary?"
fengtian.informalempire.4.a:0 "How much further can this go?"
fengtian.informalempire.5.t:0 "Mantetsu Dominance"
fengtian.informalempire.5.d:0 "Japanese expertise and Mantetsu's influence propels Fengtian forward in ways previously thought impossible, but for all intents and purposes most meaningful control has passed from the hands of the Assembly to Japan. The Grand Marshal, for better or worse, stands alone before Mantetsu's overwhelming power in the country. It will be up to him to determine the path forward, if there is even one to be found, even as the legitimacy of the government collapses about him."
fengtian.informalempire.5.a:0 "These are dire times"

fengtian.informalempire.6.d:0 "Angered by Japan's increasing control over our country, protests have broken out in Mukden, Harbin, and Changchun. Police and military units are already on site, containing the protests, but the damage is already done."
fengtian.informalempire.6.a:0 "Unfortunate"

fengtian.informalempire.7.t:0 "Major Anti-Japanese Protests"
fengtian.informalempire.7.d:0 "Angered by the overwhelming control over our country by Japan and Mantetsu, protests have broken out across the country. Police and military units are already on site, but they seem unwilling to go far to limit the protests. While they ought to die down in a few days, it seems unlikely that this will be the last of the protesters unless major changes occur."
