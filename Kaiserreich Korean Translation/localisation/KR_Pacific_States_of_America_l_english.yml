Now that elections have been held and Democrat power retained, we can now address this concern. This program proposed by the Department of Labor was meant to alleviate the west's employment shortage and was supported by the Republicans. Now traditionally our party line is to respect the Alien Exclusion act and the rights of natural born American workers to determine the direction of the economy, but our employment shortage is that much greater as we struggle to reclaim America.

pacificstates.64.t:0 "Pacific Movement of the Eastern World Uncovered"
pacificstates.64.d:0 "We initially thought that our intelligence service was overreactive when they warned us of Japanese infiltration, but this revelation justifies the time spent. Our of our new West Coast operations, agents uncovered pamphlets sent to prominent Japanese and African American leaders questioning the validity of our government. These pamphlets were traced to an organization called the Pacific Movement of the Eastern World, whose leadership appears to advocate in favor of a Pacific Japanese Alliance that advocates for unrestricted imperial growth of Japan in Asia.

The mountains on either side of the canyon were difficult of access with neither road nor trail, and their rocks were protected by neither trees nor grass from the blazing heat of the sun. The site of Boulder City was a cactus-covered waste. The transformation wrought here in these years is a twentieth-century marvel.'

pacificstates.101.t:0 "Perez v. Sharp"
pacificstates.101.d:0 "The case involving the marriage of Andrea Perez to Sylvester Davis has finally reached the Supreme Court. Andrea Perez is classified as White while Sylvester Davis is considered Negro as per the US Census. However, California's law forbids "All marriages of white persons with Negroes, Mongolians, members of the Malay race, or mulattoes are illegal and void" and that "no license may be issued authorizing the marriage of a white person with a Negro, mulatto, Mongolian or member of the Malay race". Consequently county clerk W. G. Sharp followed California Law and refused to give them their marriage licenses.\n\nHowever, Perez with the help of their lawyer, Daniel G. Marshall, brought forth a writ of Writ of Mandamus. Within the trial, one of the arguments that was brought up was the fact that both Perez and Davis were Catholic and wanted a Catholic Marriage that included mass. By denying them the license, they stated that the state was depriving them of the Holy Sacrament of Matrimony.\n\nHowever, the fate of their case is within the hands of the Supreme Court. What shall be decided?"

pacificstates.102.d:0 "In Los Angles news has been made of José Gallardo Díaz, who was recently found murdered near a swimming hole in Commerce, near LA. However, what made the story more newsworthy was the case of the men who are accused of murdering the man. The LA Police found a gang of 17 Men, of Mexican-American descent, nearby and believe that they are responsible for the crime. This has attracted something of a media circus as activists have tried to protest the actions claiming that these men are not the killer and are innocent, the fact that there is insufficient evidence to link them. Despite this nine of them were convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to serve time in San Quentin Prison, with the rest being imprisoned in Los Angeles County jail.\n\nThe case has generated much animosity within the white populace towards Mexican-Americans, not helped by the fact that both the Police and the Press have characterized all Mexican Youths as 'pachuco hoodlums and baby gangsters.'"

pacificstates.103.d:0 "With the war going on, rations have been imposed upon the public. Despite this, some within the Mexican-American Community fount this by wearing Zoot Suits that use materials that are needed for the war effort. Many White Americans regard wearing the Zoot Suit as a sign of criminality and loose morals. Tensions have continued in Los Angeles to rise till they exploded into violence. Soldiers and Sailors beat and engaged in rioting against the Mexicans. Meanwhile, the local press tended to praise the Sailors and Soldiers of 'having a cleansing effect to rid Los Angeles of Miscreants and Hoodlums'. One journalist on the scene, Carey McWilliams, wrote:\n\n'Marching through the streets of downtown Los Angeles, a mob of several thousand soldiers, sailors, and civilians, proceeded to beat up every zoot suiter they could find. Pushing its way into the important motion picture theaters, the mob ordered the management to turn on the house lights and then ran up and down the aisles dragging Mexicans out of their seats. Streetcars were halted while Mexicans, and some Filipinos and Negroes, were jerked from their seats, pushed into the streets and beaten with a sadistic frenzy'"

Their shops have been looted and more atrocities have been lumped upon them. The Gringo Press has even joined in on the action urging them to continue with their actions. To many within the Mexican Congress, this is an outrage. Our own citizens who have gone to America for temporary work, not to mention those with ties to Mexico due to ancestral are being mistreated.

To calm tensions between America and Mexico, the McGucken Committee has been created lead by the Archbishop of Los Angeles, Joseph Thomas McGucken. The report concluded that Racism was clearly at the center of the riots as well as stating 'an aggravating practice (of the media) to link the phrase zoot suit with the report of a crime.' The governor of California appointed the Peace Officers Committee on Civil Disturbances, chaired by Robert W. Kenny, president of the National Lawyers Guild to make recommendations to the police. Human relations committees were appointed, and police departments were required to train their officers to treat all citizens equally"

This years' Congressional Budget has fortunately found some money to allocate to a long-term project. Three plans are presented to the military high command to meet and exceed the military projects of our rivals. The first is a rocket by Goddard theoretically capable of delivering explosives from miles away without risking pilot lives. The second is Oppenheimer's planned theoretical bomb using radioactive heavy metals as researched in Austria and Germany. The third is a much cheaper plan as proposed by the eccentric Wilhelm Reich, he claims that a bomb can be made much cheaper using his own physics research."

The bomb itself being a hollow shell with layers of metals covering that never did explode, save for it's collapse when Reich attempted to destroy it during the investigation.
