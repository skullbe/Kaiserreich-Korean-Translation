bhutan.0.t:0 "Status of Bhutan"
bhutan.0.d:0 "Bhutan was always on the periphery of Great Britain’s sphere, and when the empire began to collapse, it remained firmly on the periphery.  Following the establishment of a socialist republic in Bengal, Bhutanese statesman Sonam Topgye Dorji managed to negotiate a stable relationship with the Bharatiya Commune. Bhutan withdrew from their traditional claims in the Duars and recognized the Commune as an independent nation, and in return, the new syndicalist government in Calcutta continued the Raj’s pre-revolution economic investment and recognized the sovereignty of Bhutan.  With the situation in India heating up, and instability in Bhutan’s close northern neighbor Tibet following the death of the 13th Dalai Lama, the kingdom aims to stand as an island of peace and stability amidst this vast sea of chaos."
bhutan.0.a:0 "Interesting"

bhutan.1.t:0 "The Himalayan Powderkeg"
bhutan.1.d:0 "Since the reign of the great Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, Bhutan has been ruled by the Zhabdrung reincarnations, who delegated temporal power to the Druk Desi, elected by the nobles, or penlops, and the Je Khenpo, elected by the monks. However, these two leaders have conspired over time to eliminate the power of the Zhabdrung, and by the nineteenth century the country was firmly in the hands of the Druk Desi and Je Khenpo.  This Diarchy was further streamlined when the penlop of Trongsa, Ugyen Wangchuck, crushed his rivals and crowned himself a hereditary monarch in 1907.  The kingdom saw a brief period of crisis at the death of King Ugyen in 1925, where, amongst the chaos of the Indian Revolution, two claimants, Ugyen’s son Jigme and the penlop of Paro Tshering Penjor, raced to crown themselves as his successor.  With the help of Ugyen’s close political allies, the Dorji Family, Jigme managed to secure the throne and consolidate his power.  However, with the power of the Dorji family waning, other political forces have risen to challenge Jigme’s rule.  The newest reincarnation of the Zhabdrung has spent the last ten years building a base with which he challenge the king’s authority, and there are many within Bhutan who aim to profit from the king’s weakness."
bhutan.1.a:0 "So much for an island of stability, huh?"

bhutan.2.t:0 "The Pretender in Paro"
bhutan.2.d:0 "To the west of our capital lies Paro, granted to Tshering Penjor by the former King Ugyen, along with promises that Tshering Penjor would rule the kingdom following the late king’s death.  Only the haste of Sonam Topgye Dorji in coronating the young prince Jigme Wangchuck prevented him from taking the throne for himself, and the noble has fumed in the west ever since.  Tshering Penjor holds a small stockpile of firearms, as well as the late king Ugyen’s Raven Crown.  While it is true that Tshering Penjor has served the king faithfully since Jigme beat him to the title, one can only wonder where his true loyalties lie.  He has many allies within the more traditionalist penlops and key members of Bhutan’s limited armed forces, and serves as a rallying point for those in opposition of the king’s policies.  However, with no wives or sons to speak of, it is generally thought that Tshering Penjor will die by the time Jigme’s son, Jigme Dorji, is of age to inherit the traditional seat of heirs to the kingdom at Paro."
bhutan.2.a:0 "We should keep a close eye on him"

bhutan.3.t:0 "Sonam Topgye Dorji Returns"
bhutan.3.d:0 "The king’s primary advisor, the Gongzim Sonam Topgye Dorji, has returned from a mission to the Bharatiya Commune.  As the main conduit to the outside world, he brings an assortment of gifts and treasures that he obtained while abroad, including Weltkrieg vintage rifles and various luxury goods.  Having presented these gifts to the king, Sonam Topgye immediately set about managing the affairs of the state.  As the king’s minister, Sonam Topgye is the foremost ally of the Wangchuck family, and with their children betrothed to one another, it seems that Jigme aims to keep it that way.  Though their power was the most disrupted by the Indian Revolution, the Dorji family remain the richest family in Bhutan, and aim to use that wealth for the benefit of the nation and the king, though many of the more conservative elements of Bhutan see their methods of reform to be outlandish and ill-designed."
bhutan.3.a:0 "What good is a Druk Gyalpo without a good Gongzim?"

bhutan.4.t:0 "The Zhabdrung Makes His Move"
bhutan.4.d:0 "After years of planning, it seems that the Zhabdrung is aiming to make some sort of power play against the king.  Rumors are spreading across Bhutan that the brother of the Zhabdrung, Choekyi Gyeltshen, travelled to India to meet with the prominent Agrarian Mohandas Gandhi, pledging the establishment of a socialist theocracy in return for his help.  While the Indian leader declined to support this insurrection, further rumors have spread claiming that there is a plot led by the supporters of the Zhabdrung which aims to secretly assassinate the King Jigme!  Already the leading men of Bhutan have cried out for action, pledging to bring the Zhabdrung and his supporters to justice if these accusations are true."
bhutan.4.a:0 "That snake!"

bhutan.5.t:0 "A New Head of the Guard?"
bhutan.5.d:0 "The position of head of the Royal Guard has remained in the hands of an elder member of the Wangchuck family since long before the coronation of Jigme. With rumours of plots against Jigme, Tshering Penjor has pushed relentlessly for the installation of the noble warrior Namgyal Bahadur into this post.  While the king is wary of introducing an agent loyal to Tshering Penjor so close to himself, Namgyal Bahadur is proven commander and skilled fighter, and his help would be invaluable were armed conflict to break out."
bhutan.5.a:0 "The king must be protected! Call on Penjor’s man!"
bhutan.5.b:0 "There’s no need for all of these changes!"

bhutan.6.t:0 "Jigme Addresses the Court"
bhutan.6.d:0 "With rumors of a Zhabdrung led coup against the king brewing, Jigme has decided to inject a fair bit of normalcy back into Bhutan politics.  Bhutan has long since been divided between traditionalists led by Tshering Penjor, and reformers led by Sonam Topgye.  By making an address that plays to one of the two sides, Jigme would bring the debate back around from assassinations to tax collection.  However, such divisive talk threatens to further split Jigme’s base of support, a base which he needs now more than ever."
bhutan.6.a:0 "Favor the Reformers"

bhutan.7.t:0 "March for the Zhabdrung!"
bhutan.7.d:0 "A large number of communities in the north of the kingdom have taken up in pilgrimage towards Talo Monastery, armed as though they were an army.  Tshering Penjor has written to the king warning about this armed mob, though he has not offered his assistance in dealing with them."
bhutan.7.a:0 "We will send a force north to meet them"
bhutan.7.b:0 "If Tshering Penjor is worried, let him deal with it!"

bhutan.8.t:0 "Safety of the Heir"
bhutan.8.d:0 "Since his birth in 1929, the son of the king, Jigme Dorji, has lived with his father, being taught the basics of governance, religion, and warfare by Jigme’s closest councillors.  With the capital growing more dangerous by the day, Sonam Topgye has offered to take the young heir to India, where he could better his Hindi and enroll in a formal school."
bhutan.8.a:0 "He’d be safer abroad"

bhutan.9.t:0 "Clashes Around Punakha"
bhutan.9.d:0 "The lands surrounding Punakha have traditionally belonged to the reigning Zhabdrung and it is with these lands that the most recent incarnation has begun to supply his supporters.  In response to his actions, the king has moved to seize these lands for himself, sending the Royal Guard into the surrounding villages to root out any opposition.  While most of the settlements were cooperative, one was harboring a gang of the Zhabdrung’s bandits, who managed to rout our forces in a surprise attack.  This village remains out of our grasp, a base for the Zhabdrung’s marauders."
bhutan.9.a:0 "How embarrassing!"

bhutan.10.t:0 "Clashes around Punakha"
bhutan.10.d:0 "The lands surrounding Punakha have traditionally belonged to the reigning Zhabdrung and it is with these lands that the most recent incarnation has begun to supply his supporters.  In response to his actions, the king has moved to seize these lands for himself, sending the Royal Guard into the surrounding villages to root out any opposition.  While most of the settlements were cooperative, one was harboring a gang of the Zhabdrung’s bandits, who nearly managed to rout our forces in a surprise attack.  Thankfully our disciplined warriors were able to regroup and fight off these vagabonds, though many were shaken by their opponents ferocity."
bhutan.10.a:0 "A close save"

bhutan.11.t:0 "Tshering Penjor Offers Banners"
bhutan.11.d:0 "Tshering Penjor has arrived in Punakha at the head of an army to support Jigme in his struggle against the Zhabdrung.  His forces are equal in number to those of the king, though they lack modern weaponry.  Tshering Penjor has requested that he be given the honour of leading the combined armies as he is a more experienced commander than King Jigme.  Tshering Penjor’s martial ability would be an asset in the conflict to come, but many in the king’s inner circle have questioned the western penlop’s loyalty.  Perhaps it would be best if the king personally led this force."
bhutan.11.a:0 "Tshering Penjor may lead the vanguard"
bhutan.11.b:0 "King Jigme will lead this army"

bhutan.12.t:0 "Word from Phuentscholing"
bhutan.12.d:0 "Sonam Topgye has sent word from his estate on the Indian border, stating that he has made contact with foreign arms dealers who would be willing to smuggle weapons into the kingdom through Dorji connections in Kalimpong and Calcutta.  While these weapons would be useful against the Zhabdrung, this transaction would only further indebt the king to the Dorji family."
bhutan.12.a:0 "Tell him to call in his contacts"
bhutan.12.b:0 "We do not need socialist arms!"

bhutan.400.t:0 "Clash Between Warriors"
bhutan.400.d:0 "Some of Tshering Penjor’s mercenaries have come into conflict with some of the local militias.  These men claim that the mercenaries, Hindu warriors from Nepal, have disrespected a local shrine and stolen equipment.  With Tshering Penjor remaining silent on the brewing conflict, it has fallen on the king to reach some agreement."
bhutan.400.a:0 "Cast these wretched mercenaries out"
bhutan.400.b:0 "We cannot afford to lose more warriors"

bhutan.13.t:0 "The Shipment Arrives"

bhutan.13.a:0 "Well done Dorji!"

bhutan.14.t:0 "Demands from Our Vassals"
bhutan.14.d:0 "With Sonam Topgye’s shipment of foreign weaponry arriving without incident, discussions began about who exactly would receive the guns. While the Royal Guard remains under equipped, many of our vassals still field armies of swords and bows."
bhutan.14.a:0 "We need these guns for our own men"
bhutan.14.b:0 "Give some arms to our most loyal allies"
bhutan.14.c:0 "Share our new weaponry with all of our allies"

bhutan.15.t:0 "The Zhabdrung is Located"
bhutan.15.d:0 "While there were many who feared that the Zhabdrung had managed to flee to Tibet, Nepal, or to the Bharatiya Commune, reports have come through that the young lama is gathering his supporters at Talo Monastery in the hills north of Punakha.  Many believe that he aims to gather an army there before heading south to reclaim his lands and former powers.  The majority of the court feel that while the Zhabdrung remains living, he is a threat to Bhutan’s stability."
bhutan.15.a:0 "The king must act"

bhutan.16.t:0 "March on Talo"
bhutan.16.d:0 "The march from Punakha to nearby Talo Monastery has started to reveal how powerful the Zhabdrung has become over the last decades.  Our army has been harassed consistently since turning south, and the hope of catching our opponent off guard has been dashed.  The further we drive into the Zhabdrung’s territories, the clearer it becomes that our numerical and martial advantage is less pronounced than once thought."
bhutan.16.a:0 "We continue into the belly of the beast"

bhutan.17.t:0 "Siege of Talo"
bhutan.17.d:0 "The royal coalition has faced far greater resistance than expected from the forces loyal to the Zhabdrung, but has managed to organize a proper siege of Talo Monastery.  While the king’s army outnumbers those within the monastery by hundreds of men, and is armed with small arms and a cannon, it has become increasingly clear that an open confrontation would be devastating, both to the royal army and Jigme’s credibility.  Even more worrying are the conflicts beginning between mercenaries loyal to Sonam Topgye Dorji and a number of Tshering Penjor’s levies.  The king struggles to maintain discipline and worries that many within the coalition would sooner turn on each other than face the Zhabdrung."
bhutan.17.a:0 "Perhaps a solution will present itself"

bhutan.18.t:0 "Samten Jamtsho Presents a Solution"
bhutan.18.d:0 "The king’s closest ally among the monastic body, Samten Jamtsho, has returned from a meeting he had with many of the monks within the temple.  Invoking the ancient role of Bhutanese monks as mediators of peace, the monks within Talo Monastery would be willing to arrange a meeting between the king and the Zhabdrung, nominally to determine the fate of the young upstart.  While Tshering Penjor has expressed his concern regarding the safety of such a meeting, Samten Jamtsho is adamant that the monks could guarantee the safety of the king.  Such a meeting would thrust the king into the lion’s den, but it may be our only chance to avoid the bloodshed of open conflict.  With the tensions within the king’s forces mounting, it may be the only option he has left."
bhutan.18.a:0 "We have no choice but to take this risk!"
bhutan.18.b:0 "Maintain the Siege! We can wait out this upstart"

bhutan.19.t:0 "The Monks of Talo"
bhutan.19.d:0 "The continued siege of Talo Monastery has taken a toll on its inhabitants.  A number of monks, gaunt with the signs of starvation, have snuck out of the fortress to conspire with the Je Khenpo’s representative Samten Jamtsho, seeking to negotiate a peace.  Samten Jamtsho, a loyal agent of the king, has instructed them that lasting stability within the country will only be found in a world without the Zhabdrung.  While the majority of the monks here are repulsed by such an idea, in the absence of the Je Khenpo Choekyi Wangchuck, Samten Jamtsho is the highest monastic authority present, barring the Zhabdrung of course.  The group has returned to the monastery, their minds laden heavy with the task at hand."
bhutan.19.a:0 "A necessary evil"

bhutan.20.t:0 "Sudden Death of Zhabdrung Jigme Dorji"
bhutan.20.d:0 "A delegation of Monks, including a number of the king’s conspiratorial group, has approached the king and his allies.  They revealed that the Zhabdrung tragically passed away in the night, in a death so sudden and silent that even the monks studying in the room adjacent heard nothing.  While the mood among the king’s party is somber, there is a great deal of relief that there will not be greater bloodshed on this day."
bhutan.20.a:0 "We must begin to rebuild"

bhutan.21.t:0 "Withdrawal to Punakha"
bhutan.21.d:0 "As the king’s forces begin their journey back to the capital, a silence hangs heavy on the countryside.  In villages and lamaseries across the nation, furtive whispers level accusations against the king and his allies.  Many speak in hushed tones of a silk scarf in the night, either as the last act of the desperate Zhabdrung, or the tool of an agent of the king.  At the same time, official messengers spread word of the Zhabdrung’s tragic death of natural causes.  Their reports mix accusations of the Zhabdrung’s infidelity and moral degradation with tales of King Jigme’s sorrowful mourning over the death of his rival and de jure overlord.  While few fully believe this story, none would dare to openly question it."
bhutan.21.a:0 "Better to be feared than loved, if you cannot be both"

bhutan.22.t:0 "Jigme Ambushed"
bhutan.22.d:0 "The meeting between Jigme Wangchuck and his rival began cordially, but it soon became clear that the Zhabdrung had little intention to surrender and plead forgiveness.  He instead began to berate the young king, mixing insult with threat.  As his tirade reached a fevered pitch, one of the king’s personal guards drew his blade and began to advance on the Zhabdrung, provoking a frenzied response from the young lama’s supporters. A large group of warriors, armed with knives and swords, fell upon the king and his entourage.  Several of his guard fell to their blades, and the king himself only barely escaped, badly wounded.  The king was taken immediately to his personal tent, and healers work desperately to bring him back from the brink of death.  With the king incoherent and incapacitated, all eyes have turned to Tshering Penjor to avenge the king in an assault against the monastic fortress."
bhutan.22.a:0 "The snake revealed"

bhutan.23.t:0 "End of the Zhabdrung"
bhutan.23.d:0 "In response to the treachery of the Zhabdrung, Tshering Penjor has claimed that an evil spirit had possessed the leader of Talo Monastery, and that it was the duty of any faithful man to smite this demon.  The fight for the fortress was short, brutal, and bloody.  All who opposed the royal forces were put to death.  At the height of the fighting, the Zhabdrung was found hiding in his chamber and unceremoniously executed by some of Tshering Penjors soldiers.  The western penlop then brought the head out to the remainder of the late Zhabdrung’s supporters, and announced that they were free of the evil spirit’s spell.  The army has begun the march back to Punakha, even as the condition of King Jigme further deteriorates."

bhutan.24.t:0 "The King Passes Away"
bhutan.24.d:0 "The capital is in a state of mourning.  His majesty the wise and honorable Jigme Wangchuck has passed away, suffering from a number of wounds he received at the hands of the treacherous snake of Talo Monastery.  As the family of the king gather to celebrate his short but illustrious life and begin funeral preparations, two notable men of the nation are absent.  Tshering Penjor has withdrawn from the capital with a number of his closest allies, gathering support among the western penlops.  No word has come from Sonam Topgye Dorji either, and a number of prominent reform minded nobles have departed the court to parts unknown."

The former penlop of Paro, a somber military man, has pledged to defend Bhutan from foreign aggressors, and has already begun to speak of creating a new Royal Bhutan Army, led by his close allies.

He aims to crown the late King’s young son as the next Druk Gyalpo. While he has gathered some support, both he and his puppet pose no threat to us while south of the southern mountain passes.  Namgyal Bahadur has gathered the Royal Bodyguard and a small army of loyal soldiers to meet this host of rebels before they can reach the capital. While Namgyal Bahadur seeks to destroy Sonam Topgye’s forces, many within the court have advocated for a more conciliatory approach."

Tshering Penjor has named the young Jigme Dorji Wangchuck as his heir, and granted the young king the Trongsa penlop.  He also promised to respect Sonam Topgye’s interests in the south of the country and grant the statesman considerable autonomy in return for an annual payment of guns and Indian trade goods.

Though both sides suffered considerable casualties, the Royal forces were barely able to repel the usurpers.  Seeking to resolve the conflict, the Je Khenpo has negotiated a truce that satisfies the two parties.

Few suspect that the new king, the eight year-old Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, will amount to much more than a pawn of Sonam Topgye Dorji and his allies, at least in the short term.

Tshering Penjor has not made any moves openly against the young Jigme Dorji, offering an opportunity to bury the hatchet between the rebellious lord and his liege.  Some of the king’s advisors have suggested that a large gift could win over the support of Tshering Penjor, while others feel that the Paro penlop will come to terms of his own accord, realizing the futility of resisting the king."

bhutan.48.t:0 "Treaty of Calcutta"
bhutan.48.d:0 "The recent Indian National Congress, and the appointment of Moderate leader A. K. Fazlul Huq as head of the Calcutta government presented our nations an opportunity to reaffirm our commitments to one another.  Sonam Topgye has travelled to Calcutta to meet with the Tiger of Bengal, drafting a new treaty of friendship.  While initially negotiations began to stall out, they were salvaged by young moderate leader Jawaharlal Nehru, who developed a close bilateral agreement with Sonam Topgye Dorji.  Mr. Nehru has promised increased Indian investment into the mountain kingdom, in return for political reforms and the legalization of the Bharatiya aligned Druk National Congress."

bhutan.49.t:0 "Indo-Bhutanese Relations Break Down"
bhutan.49.d:0 "In response to the recent appointment of Subhas Chandra Bose as chairman of the Indian National Congress, we have sent a group of advisors to meet with this new firebrand leader.  Unfortunately, these diplomats have been turned away at the Indian border, which has significantly tightened following Bose’s ascension.  It seems that the new chairman’s promise to cease all negotiations with ‘reactionary’ powers was more than just bark.  We will have to see how this new diplomatic relationship will pan out, but it is clear that the new enemy on our borders has stoked traditional isolationist thought domestically."
bhutan.49.a:0 "Tragic"
bhutan.49.b:0 "We will not be bullied by Bose and his thugs!"

bhutan.50.t:0 "Bose Breaks the Treaty of Calcutta"
bhutan.50.d:0 "After seizing power in the Commune, Subhas Chandra Bose has rapidly reversed the diplomatic agreements made between Sonam Topgye Dorji and his predecessor.  Blasting these treaties as an example of his domestic opponents’ weakness, Bose has militarized the border and began turning away merchants and diplomats alike.  We will have to see how this new diplomatic relationship will pan out, but it is clear that the new enemy on our borders has stoked traditional isolationist thought domestically."
bhutan.50.a:0 "Tragic"

bhutan.51.t:0 "Direction for our Military"
bhutan.51.d:0 "While there are few in our government who do not believe that our military requires reform, the direction of that reform is a source of intense debate.  Reform minded members of the court advocate for increased investment into the local militias of Bhutan, with the aim of strengthening its defense, while the traditionalist leader Namgyal Bahadur repeatedly calls for the creation of a small but effective central army."
bhutan.51.a:0 "We will create a small but effective army"
bhutan.51.b:0 "We will invest in our militias"

bhutan.52.t:0 "The National Assembly"
bhutan.52.d:0 "Gongzim and Regent Sonam Topgye Dorji has called for the creation of a National Assembly, to advise the king and provide a voice for more localized issues.  While he has determined that such a council should be made up of twenty representative, presided over by a Dorji Gongzim, there still remains the issue of who exactly should fill these seats.  With the assembly given the power to introduce recommendations to the reigning king, such a matter could define the nation for years to come."
bhutan.52.a:0 "All twenty members will be elected by the Gepos village leaders"
bhutan.52.b:0 "Each penlop and the Je Khenpo is afforded a representative, with ten elected counterparts"
bhutan.52.c:0 "The seats will be split between representatives of the penlops and the monasteries."

bhutan.53.t:0 "First Meeting of the National Assembly"
bhutan.53.d:0 "The new assembly has come together for one of their two annual meetings in Punakha.  The assembly is made up of twenty members, each representing a number of Gewogs, small administrative districts containing a few villages.  While in Punakha they drafted up a number of plans for their future meetings, and aim to begin formally advising the king at their next meeting.  Their primary goal is to make the king aware of local problems which may otherwise be overlooked by the court."
bhutan.53.a:0 "The people have spoken"

bhutan.54.t:0 "First Meeting of the National Assembly"
bhutan.54.d:0 "The new assembly has come together for one of their two annual meetings in Punakha.  The assembly is made up of twenty members, nine appointed by each of penlop governors, one representing the monasteries, and ten representing a number of Gewogs, small administrative districts containing a few villages.  While in Punakha they drafted up a number of plans for their future meetings, and aim to begin formally advising the king at their next meeting.  Their primary goals are to defend the interests of the penlop aristocrats and to make the king aware of local problems which may otherwise be overlooked by the court."
bhutan.54.a:0 "Truly an esteemed collection of advisors"

bhutan.55.t:0 "The National Assembly Radicalizes"
bhutan.55.d:0 "In the last two meetings of the National Assembly, the body has drafted a number of advisory pieces for the king.  Unfortunately, the Speaker of the Assembly Sonam Topgye has contended that a number of these proposals were far too radical, calling upon resources that the crown did not have, and disrupting the central planning that the Gongzim has long called for.  In response to the increased antagonism between Sonam Topgye and the council, many members have begun advocating for more power to be given to the assembly, forming a new power block of radical reformers."
bhutan.55.a:0 "A dangerous new faction"

bhutan.56.t:0 "The National Assembly Stagnates"
bhutan.56.d:0 "The last two meetings of the National Assembly have been an exercise in futility.  With some members representing conservative aristocrats, and others largely beholden to the serfs who toil under these lords, it has been hard to find common ground.  Debates turn into shouting matches and little progress is made, all while members radicalize on either side."
bhutan.56.a:0 "Perhaps Bhutan is not ready for democracy"

bhutan.57.t:0 "Jigme Dorji takes the Reins of Government"
bhutan.57.d:0 "Having completed his education and proven himself as spirited and diligent, Jigme Dorji has been given a number of new powers, with regent Sonam Topgye Dorji returning to his role as the king’s first minister.  While the king will still be largely reliant on his advisors and his court, he also incredibly independent, and seeks to begin his own program of societal reform."
bhutan.57.a:0 "May his reign be long and prosperous"
