### Ideas ###
USA_great_depression:0 "대공황"
USA_great_depression_desc:0 "1925년 뉴욕 주식 시장이 붕괴된 이후 미국은 대공황에 사로잡혀 있습니다. 계속되는 대공황은 미국을 괴롭히는 엄청난 경제적 고통을 주는 것 외에도, 서로 못잡아먹어서 안달인 롱과 리드 모두에게 힘을 주었습니다."

USA_black_monday:0 "대공황"
USA_black_monday_desc:0 "미국을 10년 이상 사로잡아 온 대공황은 후버 정권 하에서 서서히 회복되고 있는 듯 보였습니다. 하지만 최근 베를린 주식 시장의 붕괴는 대공황을 더욱 악화시켰습니다. 오직 신과 다음 대통령만이 언제 대공황이 끝날지 알고 있습니다."

USA_black_monday2:0 "대공황"
USA_black_monday2_desc:0 "미국을 10년 이상 사로잡아 온 대공황은 후버 정권 하에서 서서히 회복되고 있는 듯 보였습니다. 하지만 최근 베를린 주식 시장의 붕괴는 대공황을 더욱 악화시켰습니다. 오직 신과 다음 대통령만이 언제 대공황이 끝날지 알고 있습니다."

USA_political_crisis:0 "정치적 위기"
USA_political_crisis_desc:0 "미국이 위기에 처했습니다. 10년 넘게 나라를 황폐화시키고 있는 대공황은 아직도 끝나지 않았습니다. 대중의 절박함은 최근 몇년동안 극좌 사회당과 극우 제일당이 지지를 얻도록 만들었습니다. 몇몇 사람들은 맥아더와 군을 경기침체와 정치적 과격파 모두를 해결하기 위한 방법으로 여깁니다. 많은 사람들은 현재의 상황이 한시바삐 해결되지 않거나 1936년 선거에서 급진적인 대통령 후보가 승리할 경우 미국이 내전으로 빠져들 수 있다고 우려합니다."

USA_auto_industry_idea:0 "미국 자동차 산업"

USA_civil_war_aftermath_idea:0 "내전 피해 복구"
USA_civil_war_aftermath_idea_desc:0 "우리가 내전에서 이겼을지 모르지만, 우리나라는 폐허 상태입니다. 대부분의 사람들은 물물 교환을 강요당하며 전기, 수도, 그리고 다른 기본적인 서비스들은 거의 기능하지 않습니다. 그리고 수백만의 사람들 특히 수천 명의 고아들이 굶주리거나 병들고 있습니다."
USA_civil_war_aftermath_idea2:0 "내전의 피해를 경미하게 회복"
USA_civil_war_aftermath_idea2_desc:0 "콜레라 전염병과 기근을 막았을지 모르지만, 전국 대부분 지역이 여전히 불타고 있습니다. 그나마 안정을 찾을 수 있는 유일한 곳은 삼엄한 경비대가 지키고 있는 새로 배달된 기근 구호품과 의약품이 들어 있는 군사 창고입니다."
USA_civil_war_aftermath_idea3:0 "내전 피해를 부분적으로 회복"
USA_civil_war_aftermath_idea3_desc:0 "도시들은 어느 정도 안정세로 돌아섰고, 화폐는 물물 교환의 시듦으로 다시 사용되기 시작했습니다. 국가가 서서히 붕괴로부터 회복함에 따라, 대량의 무덤에는 이제 묘목과 꽃이 뒤덮여 있습니다."
USA_civil_war_aftermath_idea4:0 "내전의 피해를 조금더 회복"
USA_civil_war_aftermath_idea4_desc:0 "정부 기관들이 사람들을 다시 일터로 돌려보내기 시작했고, 몇몇 존경할 만한 사업체들이 다시 문을 열었습니다. 도시의 쓰레기들을 헤집고 다니는 고아들이나 노인들의 작은 무리들을 보는 것은 드문 일이 아니지만, 대규모의 아사 위협은 지나갔습니다."
USA_civil_war_aftermath_idea5:0 "내전의 피해를 대부분 회복"
USA_civil_war_aftermath_idea5_desc:0 "불과 몇 달 전에 볼 수 있었던 전쟁의 흉터는 대부분 이 나라에서 사라졌습니다. 공장이 다시 문을 열었고, 기차와 버스 등 대중교통이 어느 정도 규칙적으로 운영되기 시작했습니다. 미국은 전쟁 전의 생활수준으로 거의 돌아갔습니다."

USA_socialist_resistance1_desc:0 "우리가 노동 연맹과의 전쟁에서 이겼을지 모르지만, 우리는 그 주민들의 마음을 얻지는 못했습니다. 생디칼리스트 테러리스트들은 철도와 공장을 공격하고, 충성스러운 우리 군인과 경찰을 무차별적으로 살해합니다."
USA_socialist_resistance2:0 "강한 사회주의자들의 저항"
USA_socialist_resistance2_desc:0 "우리의 초기 대테러 노력은 어느 정도 희망을 보이고 있지만, 사회주의 저항 단체들은 강경하게 대처하고 있습니다. 주요 테러리스트들도 일부 체포됐고, 안전가옥도 몇 군데 급습했지만, 이마저도 별다른 영향은 없었습니다."
USA_socialist_resistance3:0 "약한 사회주의자들의 저항"
USA_socialist_resistance3_desc:0 "우리는 몇몇 주요 안전가옥들을 파괴하고, 일부 주요 지도자들을 체포하는 데 성공했지만, 몇몇 주목할 만한 테러리스트들은 여전히 남아있습니다. 분석가들은 여전히 더 많은 폭탄과 공격을 예상하고 있지만, 우리의 첫 달 점령 규모에 대해서는 아무것도 예상하지 못하고 있습니다."
USA_socialist_resistance4:0 "미미한 사회주의자들의 저항"
USA_socialist_resistance4_desc:0 "지금은 극소수의 완고한 급진적인 생디칼리스트 테러리스트들만이 남아 있으며, 대부분의 동포가 살해되거나 체포되었습니다. 시카고와 밀워키의 공장 폐허 속에 숨겨져 있던 나머지 안전가옥을 파괴하기 위한 마지막 추진이 이뤄지면 스틸 벨트는 잠잠해질 것입니다."
USA_longist_resistance1:0 "대대적인 롱 지지자들의 저항"
USA_longist_resistance1_desc:0 "우리가 미주 연합과의 전쟁에서 이겼을지 모르지만, 우리는 그 주민들의 마음을 얻지는 못했습니다. 롱 지지자 테러리스트들은 철도와 공장을 공격하고, 충성스러운 우리 군인과 경찰을 무차별적으로 살해합니다."

USA_longist_resistance3:0 "약한 롱 지지자들의 저항"
USA_longist_resistance3_desc:0 "우리는 몇몇 주요 안전가옥들을 파괴하고, 일부 주요 지도자들을 체포하는 데 성공했지만, 몇몇 주목할 만한 테러리스트들은 여전히 남아있습니다. 분석가들은 여전히 더 많은 폭탄과 공격을 예상하고 있지만, 우리의 첫 달 점령 규모에 대해서는 아무것도 예상하지 못하고 있습니다."
USA_longist_resistance4:0 "미미한 롱 지지자들의 저항"
USA_longist_resistance4_desc:0 "지금은 극소수의 완고한 급진적인 롱 지지자 테러리스트들만이 남아 있으며, 대부분의 동포가 살해되거나 체포되었습니다. 루이지애나 늪에 숨어있는 나머지 안전가옥을 파괴하기 위한 마지막 추진이 이뤄지면 남부는 잠잠해질 것입니다."
USA_federalist_resistance1:0 "대대적인 연방주의자들의 저항"
USA_federalist_resistance1_desc:0 "우리가 연방 정부와의 전쟁에서 이겼을지 모르지만, 우리는 그 주민들의 마음을 얻지는 못했습니다. 연방주의자 테러리스트들은 철도와 공장을 공격하고, 충성스러운 우리 군인과 경찰을 무차별적으로 살해합니다."

USA_expand_the_USAAC_desc:0 "The United States Air Army Corps, in service since 1926, has largely remained on the sidelines of military development.

USA_modernize_cavalry_tactics_desc:0 "It was apparent from our observers in the Weltkreig that new tactics and technologies are becoming vital in the battlefield.

USA_CAS_doctrine_desc:0 "While the USAAC has technically worked with the Army for well over a decade, they have hardly ever worked together.

USA_CAS_model:0 "근접항공지원기 개발"
USA_CAS_model_desc:0 "As the Air Corps never intended to be integrated into the army, hardly any development has gone into newer Close Air Support Models.

The strikers have begun to taunt the guards, and have even assaulted scab workers brought into the factories under National Guard escort. It is clear a single spark can set off the entire American north.

An assassination of Jack Reed, meanwhile, would throw the SPA into disarray while the IWW and AFL competed for leadership... at least long enough for the immediate danger to pass.

On the economy, Garner has promised reform through personal sacrifice and austerity, as was done after the Panic of 1893.

ustates.92.d:0 "President Garner has introduced an Emergency Austerity Measures bill into Congress today, an almost certainly controversial piece of legislation which would see government spending cuts across the board - especially towards the social security net. Garner's speech to the Senate spoke of the sacrifice needed if America is to recover from the Great Depression, and it was met with mostly skepticism and jeers from non-Democratic Senators. Even Garner's own cabinet expressed reservations regarding his choice, suggesting passage of the bill might prove difficult... though, if it can be managed, it would almost certainly save the country."
ustates.92.a:0 "Believe in America"

ustates.93.t:0 "Long Denounces Austerity Measures"
ustates.93.d:0 "As discussions began in Capitol Hill regarding the austerity bill, the AFP immediately denounced it. Huey Long said in a North Carolina speech that austerity did the exact opposite of what was necessary. Rather than sharing the wealth, it took every last bit of wealth from those who needed it most. Austerity, he claims, would leave the average American more desperately poor than they are now, and would leave them vulnerable to syndicalist rhetoric. Long said he would be directing AFP to oppose the bill at every turn, for the sake of the country."

ustates.94.t:0 "D.C. Demonstration Turns Violent"
ustates.94.d:0 "A demonstration in Washington D.C. by workers and strikers voicing their disapproval of the austerity measures bill, today turned violent as police attempted to break up the crowd. SPA members present said theirs was a peaceful protest, that police provoked the crowd into a response. Regardless of the cause, the end result was a pitched battle with police that left the city in chaos for two days and left hundreds of protestors injured. SPA leader Jack Reed condemned the police action as brutality and imperialist suppression."

ustates.96.d:0 "Voting on the Emergency Austerity Measures bill began in Congress today, though early indications were not good. While the bill is solidly backed by Democratic Senators, it is rabidly opposed by both the SPA and AFP... and there are enough Republican Senators remaining on the fence, unwilling to be swayed, that passage may prove unlikely without intervention. The president's cabinet is suggesting calling for a meeting of the major party representatives in Philadelphia, to try and work out a compromise - at least enough of one to make passage easier. It is also possible that President Garner could campaign for the votes of influential Republicans. A coalition may not have been in the cards, but perhaps he could appeal to their sense of civic duty on this one instance alone?"

As the parties talked, however, it quickly became clear that Huey Long and Jack Reed would both absorb most of the attention. Despite the number of Senators they represent, everyone in the room knows very well the influence they hold in the country, and both men disagreed on almost every aspect of compromise. Reed wanted workers protected from cuts to government contracts, while Long wanted to add an Open Shop claue to austerity. While there is evidence that President Garner and Huey Long see eye-to-eye on many issues, it is quickly becoming clear that compromise will be utterly impossible with both men present."

ustates.98.d:0 "President Garner called for Huey Long to be physically removed - which was necessary, since the man refused to leave peacefully. Moments later, he forced his way back into the meeting hall and accused Garner of throwing out fiscal responsibility for the syndicates' sake. The president had little choice but to have security forces drag Long from the building, kicking and screaming, shouting that America would not stand for this treachery. It was only after he left that the subdued remaining Senators could continue the negotiations."

ustates.99.t:0 "Garner and Long Make Progress"
ustates.99.d:0 "President Garner called for Jack Reed and the SPA to be ejected from the meeting, though before Reed left he made a solemn speech to those present. He accused them of bowing to tyranny, that a government which didn't understand the worker would meet its ultimate fate at the hand of that worker. After his departure, however, things went much more smoothly. Long indicated he was willing to make compromises, so long as amendments to the austerity bill supporting Long's Share Our Wealth Society indirectly through tax breaks. With this, as well as putting Huey Long himself named as the head of a new Unamerican Activities Committee, he could go to his supporters and say that progress was finally being made. There are those present at the meeting, however, who caution that this will undoubtedly infuriate the SPA and make irrelevant any measures the government has undertaken to curb their control in the North."

SPA strikers had been attacked by Minutemen milita members, a fight which turned bloody when federal forces arrived on the scene and attempted to intervene. Several bombs were detonated, adding to the chaos, and the Senators received reports of unidentified militia forces advancing on Philadelphia. President Garner was evacuated from the building by his security forces, over his objections, and both the meeting and the vote have crumbled to a premature end."
ustates.100.a:0 "It seems the hell fire is upon us"

ustates.101.t:0 "Long and Reed Stall Meeting"
ustates.101.d:0 "While President Garner's attempt to get Huey Long and Jack Reed to come to some kind of agreement was commendable, after several days of debate it appears to have mostly come to naught. Both men are frustrated, and several times each has threatened to walk out of the meeting entirely. It is apparent from the proceedings that Reed and Long's control over their parties were waning, as both made frequent breaks to confer with their team. Republicans are split on the matter, and there are not enough of them who will vote for the bill if they believe the country will erupt into violence anyhow. Both Long and Reed have given a deadline until tomorrow, at which point they say there is no chance of the Philadelphia meeting continuing. The gathered Senators are looking to the president to somehow solve the impasse."
ustates.101.a:0 "What can I do?"

ustates.102.t:0 "Austerity Bill Passes"
ustates.102.d:0 "With the endorsement of the AFP, the Emergency Austerity Measures bill passed - though not before all SPA Senators up and walked out of the chamber in protest. News of the exemptions, as well as the added restrictions on industrial unions and Huey Long's presence at the head of a new committee which will likely see more crackdowns on socialist activity, has fired up SPA supporters across the Steel Belt with outrage. Jack Reed has declared the government a dead and useless body, so corrupt it could not even see Long for the snake he truly is, and says the American worker will never get a fair shake unless he fights for it. Demonstrations have erupted across the northern part of the country - as suspected, making the government's efforts to combat SPA control useless - although, in the South, Long's assurances have gone a long way towards keeping his supporters quiet."
ustates.102.a:0 "If Reed wants a fight, he's got one"

ustates.103.t:0 "Austerity Bill Fails"
ustates.103.d:0 "While President Garner campaigned long and hard into the night, at the end of the day there were simply too few Republican Senators willing to vote for a bill that they didn't have the support of the SPA and AFP, and which would likely result in violence anyhow. Garner's austerity plan is seen as a poor follow up to the Garner-Wagner bill he co-authored in 1934. The entire vote was even delayed by an actual fist-fight between a Republican and a AFP Senator. In the end, the vote failed by a slim margin... though the margin might as well have been a chasm, into which all of President Garner's hopes and aspirations could be tossed."
ustates.103.a:0 "Congress isn't worth piss anyways"

ustates.104.t:0 "MacArthur and the Army Remove Garner"
ustates.104.d:0 "It appears President Garner's time is up. Douglas MacArthur marched into Washington D.C today, having declared Garner an 'ineffective president whose weakness has endangered America'. MacArthur's marchers reminded many in D.C. of Cox's Army of 1932, except these men are motivated to preserve the country from extremist forces. Garner's own cabinet has assured the public that this action is necessary, and have been working with MacArthur to install an emergency government from the White House - even as the majority of America looks on in shock. Civil war is imminent."

Landon was quoted as saying 'Republicans must become practical liberals, which means that the Republican party has got to recognize the problems of a growing and complex industrial civilization.

# Economic Intervention route
ustates.106.t:0 "Landon Proposes Intervention"
ustates.106.d:0 "In response to the ongoing crisis, President Landon has proposed a bill to begin a series of economic intervention policies. The bill will create an insurance for bank deposits in treasury-approved banks that will not engage in risky investing. The bill also allows the federal government to create a comission to monitor stock market exchanges against fraud. Landon believes this will restore confidence in the market, creating jobs from one end of the country to the other. Both the SPA and the AFP have declared opposition to the bill for not going far enough, and for being too friendly to the very businesses that caused the depression in the first place. It will take some cooperation between Republicans and Democrats to overcome this united front of radicalism in Congress."
ustates.106.a:0 "This bill will not stop for them"

ustates.107.t:0 "Reed calls Landon Corrput"
ustates.107.d:0 "Alf Landon's election material made him out to be a self-made man, an entrepeneur who made his wealth starting from a small petroleum company. Landon's relationship with the oil industry culminated in the establishment of the United States Oil and Gas Association in his home state of Kansas, which freely associates with Standard Oil. To Reed and the SPA, this is the smoking gun that Landon is a class traitor, though to many these accusations have rang hollow, citing Landon as a man with the business connections to make the intervention bill stick."

ustates.108.t:0 "Huey Long calls Landon a Monopolist"
ustates.108.d:0 "Huey Long has responded, like Reed, by decrying Landon as a corrupt politician in Standard Oil's pocket. Huey Long recently spoke about how President Landon only cared for the rich and the monopolies that oppress true Americans, articulating criticism of Landon's fiscal conservatism during his tenure as Governor of Kansas. Huey Long also made sure to remind the people that, by all rights, he should be president and that he would have fixed this crisis already. President Landon, meanwhile, responded in a recent interview with newspapers that Long has a serious case of 'sour grapes', and political cartoons have begun depicting Long as a childish babboon - much to the public's amusement and Long's outrage."

Despite internal opposition for interfering with the market, Democrats have indicated they will support the president's bill."

ustates.110.d:0 "The Economic Intervention Bill has managed to pass through Congress, and has been signed into law by President Landon. Banks are immediately ushered into silence as they reorganzie before recieving Treasury approval. The comission has begun to draft reforms to stock trading that will hopefully restore confidence in the markets. It is hard to say right away if this will solve the problem, but Landon hopes that this can be the first steps to fix the economy which all moderates can agree upon."

ustates.111.d:0 "The SPA's general strike has spread far and wide, after a call by Jack Reed to demonstrate against the recently-passed intervention bill, all but bringing the nation to a standstill in many industrial states. The city of St. Louis in particular has become a warzone, day to day life all but ended as strikers clash variously either with Federal forces or with AFP Minutemen. The sense of chaos has led to several riots as protests by regular citizens have turned into looting and civil unrest. People are leaving St. Louis by the thousands, calling for immediate government intervention."
ustates.111.a:0 "This is getting out of hand"

ustates.112.t:0 "Proposed Conference with Long and Reed"
ustates.112.d:0 "In response to the ongoing crisis, Alf Landon's Secretary of Commerce has proposed a conference with both Huey Long and Jack Reed to try to arrange some sort of compromise. The Secretary says that the measures in the bill will not work unless the strikes and the violence are brought to an end. However, some within the Republican party are saying that this plan of action will not work, and claiming a conference with Long and Reed will debase their party."
ustates.112.a:0 "Ignore Long and Reed"
ustates.112.b:0 "Arrange the conference"

ustates.113.t:0 "The Great St. Louis Riot"
ustates.113.d:0 "The SPA has been aggravating the workers in the area to expand the strike. Local businesses in St. Louis have become utterly paralyzed. Many of them turned to the America First Party to provide a solution. Within days, the streets were flooded with Minutemen. There are wild reports from the chaos ranging from Minutmen stopping petty crime in the absence of police, to them creating the crime. Soon the situation had erupted into a wide scale riot. The chaos has been splashed across every newspaper in America, and within days SPA and AFP forces have begun to mobilize. War is upon us."
ustates.113.a:0 "So it begins now, does it?"

ustates.114.t:0 "Conference Begins"
ustates.114.d:0 "The conference between President Landon and both Huey Long and Jack Reed began, but within days it was clear that it was a lost cause. Long and Reed argued constantly, on almost every issue, and the only thing that united them was their personal detestation of Landon and his intervention bill. It is apparent from the proceedings that Reed and Long's control over their parties were waning, not least of which is due to constant newspaper coverage of the conference citing the two men as 'obstructionist' and 'unreasonable'. Reed and Long both see the president as the corrupt tool of corporate America, and rather than compromise their demands are tantamount to rolling back the intervention bill which has already been voted on and passed through Congress! Both are nearly ready to walk out, despite the president's pleading that they compromise for the sake of peace in the country."
ustates.114.a:0 "I have to save this conference"

ustates.115.t:0 "Scandal Rocks the Conference"
ustates.115.d:0 "While President Landon's conference is finally beginning to make slow progress, American newspapers turn their attention from Reed and Long to a different target: namely the revelation of an internal memo within General Motors corporation which indicates that not only is the company's planned settlement with strikers intended to be only temporary... but that they and other companies are being bribed into settlement by the federal government. A temporary setback as they make concessions to strikers in exchange for a bailout with the understanding that changes made can be easily undone. While many are denying this memo's veracity, the sensational aspect of the news is giving new fire to AFP and SPA supporters and is threatening to quickly escalate out of control."
ustates.115.a:0 "Cut the conference short, we need to call GM"
ustates.115.b:0 "We must keep the conference going, no matter what"

ustates.1150.t:0 "MacArthur and the Army Remove Landon"
ustates.1150.d:0 "While the conference continued for several days, it rapidly became evident that the scandal was not going to end - instead it was escalating as other sources came forward with similar information, much of it pointing to an insider effort engineered by President Landon himself. Both Jack Reed and Huey Long abandoned the conference, and as Landon did his best to save face in Congress it was clear that blame was being placed squarely on him for the conference's failure. With the crisis spiralling, General Douglas MacArthur has stepped in - with the full approval of Landon's own cabinet - to install an emergency government in the White House 'to save America from extremist forces before it's too late'. While the government has tried to assure Americans that things are under control, it's quickly becoming clear that civil war is imminent."

Many in Congress feel that the package does not go nearly far enough, while others wonder how America - in the midst of a massive economic crisis - will possibly ever pay for it. The presence of Senators from the AFP and the SPA also complicates things immensely. Even with Hoover's pledge, it's unknown if Garner-Wagner has a real chance of passing."

ustates.501.t:0 "Long and Reed Demand Changes"
ustates.501.d:0 "As expected, the early challenges to the Garner-Wagner Bill have come from the AFP and the SPA. Huey Long and his AFP Senators have demanded a vast increase in the social security provisions the bill provides, provisions most other Senators say America could never afford. Jack Reed and the SPA, meanwhile, say the bill doesn't do enough to protect the average worker, particularly from exploitation by struggling corporations. Both parties have attracted a lot of media attention, adding to the general sense of disorder and tension in Congress."

Many other Democrat and Republican Senators are concerned about the influence of the AFP and the SPA, and claim they will not vote for the bill if *any* concessions are made to either group... though others say that not courting either the AFP or SPA will make passage difficult if not impossible.

General Douglas MacArthur has unveiled a plan to infiltrate key areas in either New York City or southern Texas. Both are of high importance, New York for its industry and Texas for its oil, and both are at high risk to takeover. MacArthur says that these efforts might still come to naught if the AFP and SPA's power become too great, but he believes it will greatly increase the government's chances of maintaining control should it come to an armed conflict."

This has caused considerably controversy in some corners, especially among AFP and SPA supporters. Others say it would be far too easy for the next government to reverse the decision, leaving the corporations holding the bag and even worse off than they were before. Regardless, there is enough support to see the bill passed - and, as an added bonus, the agency to coordinate the efforts could be placed in either Minneapolils or in Charlotte, with the added bonus of new employment weakening what are AFP and SPA strongholds."

While the Americans are gripped in an economic crisis, one Canada has largely avoided, they must know the Canadians can never repay the debt... not all at once, and there was a tacit agreement after the war that the debts wouldn't be repaid until the Home Islands were recaptured. For the Americans to demand it now, they must either be desperate or must be catering to the more warlike and isolationist elements in their government."

In exchange, a trade agreement has been put in place with the Entente, something that's likely beneficial for us all. The main downside is that the agreement has been viewed as treachery by the AFP and the SPA, both of which claim our corrupt government has betrayed the very people they fired up only moments before."

Reed has drawn a direct comparison between the Minutemen and the terrorist attacks that occured on Preparedness Day in 1916, and Wall Street in 1920. The Minutemen are now subject to the Sedition Act of 1918, prosecuted as an anti-recruitment and vigilante group."

Long has organized large rallies and protests with the Minutemen there to keep the protesters safe from aggression. These highly reported-on protests have seen union strikers beaten by Minutemen without interference from the police, which calls into question Reed's ability to protect Americans."

The ceasefire has held, after all - so do they desire peace? Our question has been answered with the arrival of an envoy from the Federal government. They wish to meet once again, this time to talk about a reunion between our democratic governments. Most here in the west are willing, but there are many who say that MacArthur must first pay for his crimes. He is as much a traitor as Long and Reed, after all... if they are not willing to put him on trial as such, then how can we ever trust their word?"

It could be done, and many in our cabinet say it must be, for the sake of peace, but truth be told MacArthur is considered by many Americans to be a hero. He won the civil war for us.

After several meetings between the two governments, the only condition of the Pacific States of America government was that General Douglas MacArthur be arrested and tried for treason. The reasoning, according to American officials, was that the West considered MacArthur just as much a traitor as Huey Long and Jack Reed, and just as responsible for the death and destruction that ensued. Many in the United States consider MacArthur a hero, however, so when news was revealed of his arrest, angry demonstrations were just as prevalent as celebrations at the Pacific government's agreement to rejoin. It will likely take years for MacArthur's case to go to trial, and without a doubt will be a sensation, but for now the American Civil War is truly over."

ustates.600.t:0 "Status of the US Army"
ustates.600.d:0 "The defense of the United States has always been an uphill battle. Stretched thin against the vast breadth of the North American continent, the United States Army has had little chance to distinguish itself throughout its 160 year history. It won the bare minimum of victories to maintain American independence during the Revolution and the War of 1812. It performed admirably against a corrupt regime in the Mexican-American War but half of those forces would provide the seed for the fledgeling Confederate Army during the ensuing Civil War. More recently the Army performed barely adequately to subdue the heavily outgunned Spanish and struggled to suppress the half-starved Filipino Insurrection more than 30 years ago. Prevented from joining in the Weltkrieg on either side, it has suffered in both doctrine and technology, with no tanks at all and a small Air Corps subsidiary to the ground forces. With the hobbled lion that was the British Empire on the northern frontier and a syndicalist stronghold poised in the south, the U.S. Army must be asked to defend the Republic from enemies within and without, and few agree that they are up to the task."

ustates.601.t:0 "Status of the US Navy"
ustates.601.d:0 "The United States Navy, long the darling child of the American defense establishment has been a strong force in global maritime affairs for nearly fifty years. A rival even to the vaunted Kaiserliche Marine and Royal Navy at their height in the Weltkrieg, it has defended America's shores and sallied forth to spread stability and democracy for nigh on 160 years. From John Paul Jones' raid on the British mainland to the Battle of Manila Bay, the Navy has provided the security needed by the republic from those that would infringe upon our independence from beyond the seas. All is not well in the modern day, however. The navy's ships are old, her flagships Weltkrieg-era dreadnoughts even as Germany and the Syndicalists engage in a new naval arms race, and the tattered remnants of the Royal Navy lick their wounds. New carriers have been commissioned, but they are nowhere near ready to take on the imperial Japanese fleet. The Marine Corps fares better, hardened as they are by constant action in tropical locals, but they are small, only a few regiments strong, and are powerless to affect increasing tension at home from their far-flung island bases. The honor guard in Washington D.C. look increasingly powerless as violence in the nation's capital increases. Our White ships might dominate the waves but many question whether it will be enough to face the gathering storm n the horizon."

Now not only is a reform plan to deal with the imminent crisis necessary, but also urgent as the rebellious states threaten the unity of America. Luckily for us, several staff members had already been advocating for reform plans since the early 1920s, and they have been summoned by High Command to a meeting for them to lay out their plans. After a session full of army formalities, 4-Star General Malin Craig presented a restructuring and mobilization plan which would focus on trying to arm as many men as possible while improving and enhancing the High Command to have an edge in planning over our enemies. While many conservative members aplauded his traditionalist stance, Major General Adna R. Chaffee criticized his stance, quoting several instances in which planning and mass mobilization didn't earn the victory to the French in the Weltkrieg, and instead advocating for the adoption of the 'Thunderbolt': Fast moving armies supporting themselves on motorized and mechanized elements to quickly exploit enemy weak spots. While both sides got gridlocked into a discussion for radically different plans, Major General Leslie McNair offered an alternative solution: The American strength lies with its industry, and it is clear that in order to win, that strength should be exploited to its fullest. For that he proposes the restoration of the late 1920s and early 1930s artillery examination boards and the development of anti air and anti tank batteries to counter-act any enemy developments on this front.

However, air development during these last decades have proven that a strong air force is a vital asset for an army who wishes to come out victorious from the battlefield. Unfortunately, the Army High Command in many aspects refuses to acknowledge this, and as a result, spark conflict with many Air Branch generals who wish to direct the development of their own branch. With the country's integrity at stake, the High Command has decided to negotiate with the Air Force Generals, and the result of the negotiations is pretty clear: The Air Branch will not stand for a continuation of the Status Quo, and demands that at best, their force is given significant autonomy from the Army and reorganize as the United States Army Air Force, and at worse for the United States Army Air Corps to be expanded and supported to suit the needs of the battlefield.

After finishing a rigorous conditioning and training program started two weeks ago, a lottery was made to decide the jumping order of the experimental paradropping platoon made up of volunteers. When the Douglas C-33 took off from the Langley Air Field and finally was put into position to start the experiment, Second Lieutenant William T. Ryder became the first American Paratrooper after making his jump and landing near Fort Benning. The second man, however, refused to jump, and so the first enlisted man to become a paratrooper was Pvt. William N. "Red" King, and then the remaining 8 platoon members in the aircraft.

While originally the high training standards and relatively high mortal risk initially caused few volunteers to show up, the high command authorized a triplication of the paratrooper wage as opposed to the foot soldier wage. Soon enough, the 501st Parachute Battalion was formed, quickly followed by other battalions and regiments. After a week recruitment, the number of volunteers was enough to form 5 paratrooper divisions for us to utilize. While these divisions still lack combat experience, this breakthrough in Airborne tactics should not be underestimated, and the High Command is looking forward to seeing their investment in these divisions pay off."

While the Secretary has managed to calm the General down and reassure him that the army's role in the battlefield will always come first, word of the meeting has gone out and many Admirals, including MacArthur's bitter rival Admiral Hart, are already sending letters asking for MacArthur's resignation.

The manual consists of seven chapters – the first titled “General” followed by six chapters describing employment of antitank units in various scenarios (during the advance, halts, the development of the battle, defensive maneuvers, retrograde movements, and offensive operations). The document highlights the specific capabilities of tanks that makes them a unique threat on a modern battlefield characterized by open warfare, like the tank's speed and mobility which, when combined with the lack of a stabilized front, increased the need to ensure protection of flanks and rear areas against armored attacks. While officer trainees will loathe having another manual to read in the pile, this one is quickly turning into a must after the recent engagements."

ustates.613.t:0 "Chaffee Organizes the Combat Commands"
ustates.613.d:0 "The concept Chaffee first envisaged during his development mechanized tactics in the early 1930s was one where combined arms mechanized units would possess no formal structure. In order to present his idea more coherently to high command, he has recently written the 'Armored Force Tentative Table of Organization' where the Combat Command, as he describes it, should be flexible organization that should not have dedicated battalions. Instead, tank, armored infantry, and armored field artillery battalions, as well as smaller units of tank destroyers, engineers, and mechanized cavalry have to be assigned as needed in order to accomplish any given mission. To achieve this, he wishes to split the armored division into the combat commands named "A" for the main force, "B" for flank defense, and "R" for reserve units. While his concept is clearly inspired in the German 'Kampfgruppe' concept, the High Command has received his idea with open arms and are starting to implement the new organization system across the board as well as distributing the new manual to the field officers."
ustates.613.a:0 "It seems that studying the Germans has paid off"

ustates.614.t:0 "Release of the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet"
ustates.614.d:0 "One of the major lessons from the civil war was the need to enhance the speed and clarity of our communications on the frontline while not making our movements and organization system obvious to the enemy. In order to create a consistent naming system, the Army and Navy had designated a comission from the Signal Corps to work on a new radio alphabet system for our men to use, and we finally have the results from their efforts. With the publishing and distribution of the 'Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet' manual, our new alphabet shall utilize the codenames Able, Baker, Charlie, Dog, Easy, Fox, George, How, Item, Jig, King, Love, Mike, Nan, Oboe, Peter, Queen, Roger, Sugar, Tare, Uncle, Victor, William, X-ray, Yoke and Zebra. While similar radio systems have been developed for the Canadians and the Germans, the fact we have finally taken the task of standarizing it means we're finally catching up with the lessons we missed in the Weltkrieg"
ustates.614.a:0 "This will give us and Edge in Communications"

ustates.615.t:0 "Adoption of the M1 helmet"
ustates.615.d:0 "Ever since the Weltkrieg proved that helmets were vital to protect the infantry from flying fragments of exploded ordnance, the American Army has utilized the British Mk I helmet designed by John L. Brodie, which gave it its current nickname. While adopted, the US never saw a need to mass produce it, and instead continued to buy the model from the British in the cheap during their depression in the early 1920s. While these helmets were effective at the time, our experience in the civil war has proven that even the Brodie is no longer suitable for modern combat and, as such, a research team was created under Major Harold G. Sydenham to look for alternatives. The research team concluded that by removing the Brodie's brim, by adding side pieces and earpiece, and by incorporating the suspension system into a separate inner liner, the new helmet could provide a protection the Brodie could never afford. The original test item was known as the TS3, and it received a favorable report from the Infantry Board in the recent weeks. With the approval of the War Department, it will soon enter mass production to supply our rapidly growing army."
ustates.615.a:0 "Glad we finally got rid of the Brodies"

ustates.616.t:0 "The Victory Book Campaign"
ustates.616.d:0 "As thousands of new recruits flood into training camps across the country, community librarians have recognized an opportunity to lend their support to our government. Individual libraries sponsored book drives to donate to their local military bases. In the last few months, members of the American Library Association met to discuss a plan for a coordinated nationwide drive to supply the troops with free books. The ALA presented their idea to the United Service Organizations and The Red Cross, who have received their idea enthusiastically and begun setting up more than four hundred recreational clubs on the outskirts of military camps. The Red Cross wanted books to send to military hospitals, remote camps with no libraries, their overseas clubs, and prisoners of war. The two organizations decided to split the project's funding, while the ALA provided technical know-how and both began campaigning for government approval. While our military is reluctant of accepting donated books, there is a real need for entertainment for our soldiers in the field and Army high command decided to give its approval to the project."
ustates.616.a:0 "Let's hope our soldiers enjoy it"

ustates.617.t:0 "Cancellation of the Victory Book Campaign"
ustates.617.d:0 "While the Victory Book Campaign has managed to pave the way for institutions like the Council on Books in Wartime and the War Book Panel, the Campaign itself is beginning to draw a lot of criticism from the Army. The Campaign was unfortunately not well suited for combat units, as the bulky hardcovers were found to be unsuitable for use in the field and many of the books donated were deemed unfitting by the revision committees. From 10.827.097 books gathered in the last year, an unacceptably high percentage of these were unsuitable, with VBC staffers having discarded 5,052,858 books. While the idea is still in the air, the Army has decided to order the VBC to come to a close, but has begun plans with the CBW to create a new plan to entertain our soldiers."

ustates.618.t:0 "Creation of the Armed Services Editions"
ustates.618.d:0 "With the collaboration of the graphic artist H. Stanley Thompson and the publisher and CWB executive Malcolm Johnson, Army Chief Librarian Raymond Trautman proposed his idea of 'Armed Services Editions': mass-produced paperbacks selected by a panel of literary experts from among classics, bestsellers, humor books and poetry. With the support of the Navy Chief Librarian Isabel DuBois, the project managed to reach the Army High Command. While the proposal was sound, a clause in Trautmant's proposal sparked controversy in the High Command Meeting. As he stated that all books should be, in all circumstances, acceptable to both services, and that works with 'Statements or attitudes offensive to our Allies, any religious or racial group, or not in accord 'with the spirit of American democracy'' should be discarded. Regardless of the controversy that it caused, the Army and Navy high command have agreed to give the project the green light, with both branches offering their own printing presses and the funding to expand printing further if necessary."

ustates.619.t:0 "Creation of a Sniper Program?"
ustates.619.d:0 "With the harsh lesssons in urban warfare we have been forced to learn, we've come to realize that our army is woefully unprepared to face a new danger of the battlefield: Enemy Snipers. While Snipers proved their usefulness during the Weltkrieg, the Army high command had never seen any reason to expand upon it as it was seen as a situational solution for the battlefields of Europe. However, fighting in the American mountains, cities and forests have proved not only that they were wronged, but we have paid the price dearly for it, as we lack the means to counter-act enemy sniper operations, let alone send off snipers of our own to eliminate High Value Targets. As such, a proposal has reached High Command to kickstart one similar to the Sniper training that Canadian put their snipers through in the weltkrieg."

ustates.620.t:0 "Sniper Selection"
ustates.620.d:0 "With the first test group of snipers having left basic training, the question has been brought up. While the first test group was drawn from volunteers from all the US Army, there has been a significant performance difference between the Marine and Ranger volunteers compared to the regular army volunteers. As such, both branches are contesting for the funding of the War Department to continue the Sniper Program, and we can only pick one. Which branch shall we support?"

ustates.621.t:0 "Creation of the Office for Emergency Management"
ustates.621.d:0 "With the outbreak of the civil war, the President has dispatched the creation via executive order of an office that functioned to assist the President in clearing information on immediate defense measures. With it, the Office for Emergency Management has been born to maintain liaison with national defense agencies and to coordinate the national defense program, as well as keep both the Army and Navy in direct contact with the President. However, the mess of agencies, offices and commissions we have generated in the last few decades continues to grow, and many agree that our government should start looking into ways of reducing the amount of offices and increase the efficiency of existing ones."
ustates.621.a:0 "For now, this will do"

ustates.622.t:0 "Creation of the United States Office of War Information"
ustates.622.d:0 "Due to a lack of a centralized government agency to work as a distributor of wartime information, civilian newspapers present news as they discover and interpret it, with different outlets overalapping their stories with slight variations and the public hardly knowing what is true and what is propaganda. As such, and with permission of both the War Department and the President, the Office of War Information has been created to work as a connection between the battlefront and civilian communities. While many independent news outlets have expressed their concerns over a centralized agency becoming the sole distributor of wartime information, most experts agree that this is a necessary move."
ustates.622.a:0 "They have nothing to fear, we shall spread only the truth!"

ustates.623.t:0 "Changing the USAAC Roundel?"
ustates.623.d:0 "With the outbreak of the American Civil War, the issue has been brought up that our air planes share the same air force patch as our enemies. While radio communication has allowed us so far to distinguish between friend and foe, reports of friendly fire and unexpected enemy attacks abound, and the Air Force officers have come with a proposal to change our roundel from the star symbol within a blue circle with a red dot in the middle to a different roundel so our anti air units may better differentiate our planes from the enemy's. What should we do?"
ustates.623.a:0 "Let the enemy change it! This roundel is ours"
ustates.623.b:0 "Change it"

ustates.624.t:0 "Authorize Fire Bombings?"
ustates.624.d:0 "With the success of strategic bombing during the Weltkrieg, a proposal from the USAAF has reached the High Command. In it, it describes how to utilize a porcentage of the budget to create a separate group of bombs with a special chemical mixture that can start huge fires upon landing with the idea of utilizing these bombs on American soil against our enemies. While this could yield great effects hindering our enemy's industrial capabilities, the ethical implications of utilizing such inhumane weapons of destruction has made many members of the staff restless on the subject, as these bombs might easily end up hitting civilians unintentionally. Should we approve this despite of the dangers?"
ustates.624.a:0 "Yes, they are all traitors!"
ustates.624.b:0 "No, they are Americans too!"

ustates.625.t:0 "The War Department Relocates to the Main Navy and Munitions Buildings"
ustates.625.d:0 "With the Department of State leaving almost no room for the War Department to grow near the White House, the Secretary of War has authorized the War Department to move to a different location, specifically an ammunition warehouse provided by the navy. However, the warehouse is still too small the hold the ever growing War Department, with a new wing having been ordered to be constructed to acommodate newly employed staff, and we estimate we will need a larger structure to consolidate the 24.000 workers in offices scattered among 17 separate sites, as well as a possible additional 10.000 or more new workers that we are planning to include soon as our nation falls into conflict into conflict."

ustates.626.d:0 "Under the High Command's orders, General McNair has compiled a report of all the major flaws our army possesses at the moment that we will need to solve if we wish to prevail against our enemies in the civil war. The major summary sent to the War Department lists the following issues:\n\n1. Obviously deficient training of small units and in minor tactics.\n2. Faulty employment of the infantry division and of its combat teams.\n3. Failure fully to appreciate the purpose of motor vehicles and exploit their capabilities.\n4. Inadequate reconnaissance and lack of contact between adjacent units.\n5. Inadequate support of infantry by division artillery.\n6. Faulty signal communications.\n7. Too passive employment of antitank guns.\n8. Improper employment of horse cavalry.\n9. Neglect of ammunition supply and evacuation of wounded.\n10. Unreal situations due to faulty umpiring.\n\n In the same manner, other issues have been brought up by other officers in which they include shortages of qualified staff officers and commanders to fill all the staff roles and deficiencies in individual training that would delay the effectiveness of unit training."

ustates.627.t:0 "Construction of 'The Pentagon'"
ustates.627.d:0 "With the shortcomings of the Main Navy and Munitions Buildings, the search for a more fitting permanent office space for the War Department has been ongoing for months already. First the military turned to the head of the Army’s Construction Division, Brig. Gen. Brehon Burke Somervell. He, in turn, tasked the chief of the design section, Lt. Col. Hugh J. Casey, to come up with a building that would fit a five-sided parcel of land that had been hastily purchased just below Arlington National Cemetery on the Virginia side of the Potomac River in which to house all the War Department's componenents. Originally the building was meant to be placed in a location known as the Arlington Farms, where the road shape resembles a Pentagon, which has forced the architect team to adapt the design to said geographic space, but many in the Department are questioning if positioning the building between the cementery, which by all means is considered hallowed ground for every american, and the stunning view of Washington D.C. is really appropiate, an two new locations have been proposed for the construction. Unfortunately, the requests for the materials have already been desinged to accomodate a Pentagonal shape, so even if we were to change the building location, the building will still be made in that shape to save money, but we're still on time to decide on where should the Pentagon be."

Even though the building isn't even yet complete, a new expansion of the now lovingly called 'The Pentagon' has already been authorized, and of the 5 wings, the 3 remaining ones to be build shall have bigger offices to accomodate for the War Department's staff."

ustates.629.d:0 "With the final wing finally finished, the War Department has finally found its own home and the building now sports a reinforced concrete structure, using 680,000 tons of sand dredged from the Potomac River and  Indiana limestone for the building's façade. It occupies 28.7 acres (116,000 m2), and includes an additional 5.1 acres (21,000 m2) as a central courtyard, with the hallways being so large that messengers are being issued with roller skates and bikes to speed up messaging between offices."

#USA's Army General Descriptions by Drozdovite#
###############################################

USA_DOUGLAS_MACARTHUR_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W 26 January, 1880, in Little Rock, Arkansas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Douglas 'Big Chief' MacArthur, born from a long family line of military men, graduated from West Point as an Engineer Corps second lieutenant in 1903 with the highest grade in the academy's history. In 1904, he was promoted to first lieutenant and travelled to the Philippines in order to help his father with the construction of their headquarters. Through his father's influence, MacArthur quickly became a military advisor to President Theodore Roosevelt until 1908, where he took command of an engineer company in Fort Leavenworth, reaching the rank of Captain in 1911. All these high profile postings allowed him to join the American General Staff in 1912, at the young age of 32. MacArthur took part in the occupation of Veracruz, learning Spanish in a matter of weeks and taking part in several small skirmishes with the rebels. He returned to America in 1919, when he was assigned as the Director of the United States' Military Academy at West Point. In 1922, he returned to the Philippines, this time to inspect the island's defence status, and having to intervene personally to end mutiny of Philippino scouts. With his promotion to Major General in 1925, his notoriety only grew and grew, being sent to the 1928 Olympic games in the Netherlands to head the American Olympic Committee. However, MacArthur was also forced to comply with orders he didn't agree with, like the court martial of Brigadier General Billy Mitchell, which MacArthur has called 'one of the most distasteful orders I ever received'. During the 'Bonus March', MacArthur was forced, under President Hoover's orders, to put down the 'Bonus Army' despite MacArthur's agreeing with the protestors' demands. He has since then become the highest ranking American Officer, although he has had a troubled relation with the government's executive branch.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Born from a family that fought in the Civil War, MacArthur is willing to do whatever is necessary to keep America as a united, great and free country."
USA_DWIGHT_EISENHOWER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W October 14, 1890, in Denison, Texas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Dwight David 'Ike' Eisenhower, a fan of military history since a young age, applied for both West Point and Annapolis in 1910, being accepted in the former after the highest ranking candidate failed the physical requirement in 1911. He graduated in 1915 along with Omar Bradley and was almost discharged due to a leg injury, but West Point's chief medical officer interceded with the War Department and obtained a commission for him. Eisenhower would be posted with the 19th Infantry Regiment in the Mexican Border and reached the rank of Captain in 1917. He was transferred to Fort Benning in late 1918, where he remained training with the Camp Polk Tank school until the 1919 Motor Transport Corps convoy. 'Ike' was promoted to Major in 1920. His interest in armored warfare only grew and grew, and quickly joined Patton's and Van Voorhis in their requests of increased funding for a mechanization program. In 1924, he was sent to Panama, where he served under General Fox Conner, who decided to tutor 'Ike' into philosophy, military history and military theory and was selected in 1925 for the Command and General Staff College, graduating first in a class of 245 officers. Conner would help 'Ike' to get into the War College, becoming one of the youngest students of the academy and receiving the praise of General Pershing himself. After his graduation, he was assigned to the Army War College, and then served as executive officer to Major General George Van Horn Moseley, Assistant Secretary of War, from 1929 to 1933. Since then he has served as chief military aide of General Douglas MacArthur, accompanying him to the Philippines, where he served as assistant military adviser to the Philippine government. Since then, he has become MacArthur's undisputed second in command, and while their personalities tend to clash often, many claim that their skills complement each other."
USA_OMAR_BRADLEY_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W February 12, 1893, in Clark, Missouri, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Omar Nelson 'Brad' Bradley signed up to join the United States Military Academy in 1911, where he finished second in the placements for the appointments. However, the winner couldn't accept the congressional appointment for the academy, so it was granted to Bradley. He graduated in 1915 and was commissioned as an infantry second lieutenant, and becoming a close friend of another graduate of the same class, Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was assigned to the 14th Infantry Regiment stationed in the Mexican border, reaching the rank of Captain in 1917 and being transferred to guard the copper mines in Butte, Montana, remaining in garrison duties for the rest of the decade. From 1920 to 1924, he worked as a math teacher in West Point, reaching the rank of Major in 1924 and undergoing the advanced infantry course at Fort Benning. Bradley later studied at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School, graduating in 1929 and serving as an instructor in tactics at the U.S. Army Infantry School, where he met and established good relations with Lt.Col. George Marshall. He taught in West Point from 1929 to 1934, where he took a break to study at the U.S. Army War College, reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel. With the fears that the War Plan Blue might be executed in the near future, Bradley was first promoted to Brigadier General and then to Field Marshal along with Eisenhower by MacArthur's own request.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Largely considered one of the most dependable generals of the US Army, Marshall once described him as 'A quiet, unassuming and capable man, with sound common sense. He has an absolute dependability. Give him a job and forget it' and that reputation may have helped to speed up his promotion."
USA_GEORGE_MARSHALL_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W December 21, 1880, in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W George Catlett Marshall Jr. began his military career in the Virginia Military Institute in 1900, graduating in 1902 as a second lieutenant of the United States Army. Marshall was posted in the Philippines during the Philippine-American war, as well as helping to contain guerrilla operations in the area post-war. During the Weltkrieg, Marshall was sent to France, along with many other American officers as observers, where he was promoted to Captain for his observations. After working as aide-de-camp of General Pershing for a short time in 1919, he began being assigned to several positions in the army, mainly to relay his experience in the Weltkrieg to more inexperienced officers as well as helping the army modernize its doctrine. During this time, he became a key planner and writer in the War Department, commanded the 15th Regiment in the Legation Cities and taught the at the Army War College until 1927. Having being promoted to lieutenant colonel, he was appointed as assistant commandant of the Infantry School at Fort Benning, where he appointed Edwin F. Harding in charge of the school's publication.

While he wanted to join the Cavalry corps, his grades and overall performance in the academy caused him to be assigned to the 29th Infantry Regiment, stationed at the Philippines. In April 1911, he requested a transfer to the Signal Corps, where he completed his instruction as an aviator on May. He'd continue his pioneering work in the air force throughout the late 1910s, and became fascinated by the aircraft developments in the Weltkrieg. During the Twenties, he joined up his colleague William Lendrum Mitchell to fight for an independent air force, which lead to Mitchell being court-martialed. Arnold stood, along with other renowned airmen, in defence of Mitchell but failed to win the trial. Arnold would continue to fight for an independent air force, trying to sway congressmen and recruit pilots to his cause, until he was sent to Fort Riley for 'attempting to influence legislation in an improper manner', where he spent the next few years writing books trying to interest young people in the air force. He'd return in 1928 to enter the Army's Command and General Staff School, from where he graduated in 1929. He'd continue changing posts in the American army until 1935, where he was assigned with the General Headquarters Air Force, the closest thing to an independent Air Force he had been in all his career, being promoted to Brigadier General in March 2, 1935. With his requests of an independent air force largely refused, Arnold may harbour some resentment against the general staff..."
