USA_alien_sedition_acts:0 "방첩치안법"
USA_alien_sedition_acts_desc:0 "Garner and Congress are active to punish all those who would rebel against the United States.

USA_malice_chairty:0 "경제구호법 통과"

### Leader descriptions ###
POLITICS_JACK_REED_DESC:0 "A writer, a trade union leader, a Senator, a journalist and a Syndicalist - John 'Jack' Reed is many things. After the death of his predecessor, Alexander Berkman, this fiery radical socialist took the reins of the American syndicalist movement, and he has led this organisation to great success. While this long path from journalist to President has brought him many enemies, it also brought him many allies. He is determined to become the American version of Sebastian Faure, the founder of the Commune of France - a charismatic, unifying Syndicalist demagogue who shall turn his country into what he perceives to be a perfect society."
POLITICS_JOHN_NANCE_GARNER_DESC:0 "John Nance Garner IV, known by his peers as 'Cactus Jack', is a lawyer and long-serving Representative from Texas and the new President of the United States. He is a man of the Democratic establishment, a mildly conservative politician, and, most importantly, a fervent supporter of democracy. This Texan judge sees no reason in compromise with either the left or the right."
POLITICS_HERBERT_HOOVER_DESC:0 "전 미국 상무부 장관이자 현재 미국의 대통령인 허버트 후버는 미국 역사상 가장 미움받는 사람 중 한 사람으로서 그 자리를 굳혔습니다. 첫 임기 동안 대공황을 더 심각하게 만들기만 했던 것에도 불구하고, 1932년 하원을 통해 재선된 것은 광범위한 분노를 불러일으켰습니다. 대통령에게 있어서 슬픈 현실입니다. - 경제를 회복시키려는 그의 모든 시도는 실패했고, 상황을 진정시키려는 노력은 상황을 더 악화시킬 뿐이며, 그의 당마저 그를 외면하고 있습니다."
POLITICS_DOUGLAS_MACARTHUR_DESC:0 "외국 정부들과 자신의 국민들에게 미움받는, 미합중국의 첫번째 독재자인 총사령관 맥아더는 약하지 않습니다. 급진주의 국가들을 제거하기 위해 미국 지배층의 부름을 받아서 온 이 장군은 국가를 자신의 연대를 지휘하듯이 다스립니다 - 질서와 엄격한 규율 그리고 그에게 반대하는 모두에 대한 강력한 처벌을 통해서 말입니다. 그는 자신이 진정으로 미합중국을 구하기 위해 이곳에 왔다고 믿고 있지만, 건국의 아버지들은 그의 행동을 지지할까요?"
POLITICS_HUEY_LONG_DESC:0 "It's hard to say what the Governor of Louisiana, Huey Long exactly stands for. Some would say that his 'Share Our Wealth' program is clearly just Syndicalism in new clothing, while others would point at his undemocratic, nepotist style of rule, topped by the usage of the 'Minutemen' paramilitary to harass rivals, as a sign of his National Populist stance. Whatever may be the case, President Long is liked by the common classes, his charisma is exceptional, even if he can get arrogant at times, and his foothold over the south is not to be underestimated."

ustates.501.d:0 "1936년의 미합중국은 위기에 처했습니다. 미합중국은 첫번째 대전쟁에서 벗어날 수 있었습니다. 그 덕분에 1920년대에도 번영을 누릴 수 있었습니다. 하지만 독일 제국의 승리와 프랑스와 영국의 혁명들은 1925년 월 스트리트 대폭락을 일으켰습니다. 이로 인해 미합중국은 대공항에 빠졌고 베를린 증권 거래소가 월 스트리트의 자리를 차지하게 만들었습니다. 1928년 대선에서 당선된 허버트 후버는 미국을 복구하겠다고 약속했지만, 후버는 대공황의 문제점들을 고칠 수 없었습니다. 이것은 극좌파의 아메리카 노동 연맹과 극우파의 아메리카 우선당과 같은 급진 정당들이 미국에서 부상하게 촉발시켰습니다. 1932년 하원에 의해 후버가 재선에 성공한 것과 대공황이 아직 끝나지 않았다는 사실은 그 문제들이 금방 사라지지 않는다는 것을 의미합니다. 전국의 많은 사람들은 극단적인 정당 중 하나가 권력을 잡거나 대공황을 해결하는데 아무 것도 이뤄지지 않는다면 재앙이 발생할 것을 두려워하고 있습니다.."

ustates.62.t:0 "Nationalising the Resource Industries"

When Minute Men were seen near trade union buildings they attacked them and there were several assaults. When several Minute Men were murdered the entire south erupted into violence.

ustates.74.t:0 "CSA Militias Clash with the Minute Men"
ustates.74.d:0 "The workers militias arrived to deal with the Minute Men they were set upon by organised America First units. The militias were completely routed and forced to retreat. Organised America First units began appearing throughout the south."
ustates.74.a:0 "An embarrassing defeat."

ustates.75.t:0 "Militias Fail to Restore Order"
ustates.75.d:0 "The relatively disorganised rabble of the CSA militia proved to be nearly useless at restoring order in the south. Long encouraged his men to harass the militias and after only a few days the militia had become so impatient that they inadvertently fired at innocent civilians. Long used the situation to mobilise the Minute Men against the militia and after a brief conflict the militias were forced out of the south."
ustates.75.a:0 "Send in the army."
ustates.75.b:0 "Remove the militia."

ustates.76.t:0 "MacArthur Refuses to Send in the Army"
ustates.76.d:0 "President Reed ordered the army to deal with the Minute Men but when General MacArthur received the order he refused to deploy his forces.

ustates.77.t:0 "Militia Withdraws from the South"

ustates.78.t:0 "Mexicans Leave the South"
ustates.78.d:0 "The Mexican revolutionaries proved to be more of a liability and with their withdrawal, the trade unions were quickly eliminated by the America First and the Minute Men."

ustates.79.t:0 "Hughes and the Zeppelin"
ustates.79.d:0 "In an act of defiance against the new president, Howard Hughes flew a personal plane and attacked a zeppelin that was being used by Reed for propaganda. The zeppelin exploded and crashed killing both of the men on board. Hughes apologised for the deaths but refused to apologise for the attack. Reed was extremely angry but Hughes is a legend in California and any attempt to arrest him would be dangerous."
ustates.79.a:0 "Arrest Hughes."
ustates.79.b:0 "We can't arrest him."

ustates.80.t:0 "Long and MacArthur"
ustates.80.d:0 "Reed received information that Long was attempting to incite General MacArthur to remove Reed from office by using the military. There was no hard evidence to support the claim but MacArthur had always opposed Reed so there were some in the administration that thought it was true."
