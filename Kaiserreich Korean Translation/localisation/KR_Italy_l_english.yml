### Events ###
ita.1.t:0 "Father Charles Coughlin"
ita.1.d:0 "Three years from today, Father Charles Coughlin started doing weekly a radio broadcast in America and more than 50 million people turn on their radios and listen. He is a raving Anti-Semite, claiming that the Syndicalist Revolution in France was 'foremented by the Jew' and that the Berlin Stock Market Crash is an 'International Conspiracy of Jewish Baners' and somehow people still tune in. His hate-speech will not be tolerated by the Church, and the Pope is expected to make a decision whether to ask the United States government to shut down his broadcast so his hateful message cannot reach the public."
ita.1.a:0 "Ask the President of the United States to shut down this 'Radio Priest'"
ita.1.b:0 "It would be best if we did not interfere"
ita.2.t:0 "Gabriele d'Annunzio Dies"
ita.2.d:0 "Gabriele d'Annunzio died today of a stroke. Poet, journalist, novelist and above all a staunch Italian nationalist. Some suspected him of syndicalist views earlier in his life, but his unabated support to the Papal Risorgimento cleared him of these wild accusations. His supporters used his funeral as an occasion to call for the Risorgimento of Italy."
ita.2.a:0 "He will be missed"
ita.3.t:0 "Quadragesimo Quinto Anno"
ita.3.d:0 "Quadragesimo Quinto Anno (Latin for 'In the 45th Year') is a new encyclical written by Pope Pius XI that discusses the ethical implications of the social and economic order (45 years after Leo XIII's Rerum Novarum encyclical). The encyclical describes the major dangers for human freedom and dignity arising from unrestrained capitalism and syndicalism, calling for the reconstruction of the social order based on the principle of solidarity and subsidiarity. In the first part he reviews and applauds the encyclical of his predecessor, which helped the development of a new social conscience.\nAccording to Pius XI, three elements determine a fair wage: the worker's family responsibilities, the economic condition of the enterprise and the economy as a whole. The family has an innate right to development, but this is only possible within the framework of a functioning economy and sound enterprises. For this, Pope Pius concludes that solidarity, not conflict, is a necessary condition. The pope therefore demands more solidarity, especially between employers and employees through new forms of cooperation and communication among Catholic citizens. A new era of Catholic Corporativism is just beginning."
ita.3.a:0 "Excellent"
ita.4.t:0 "Move the Capital to Firenze?"
ita.4.d:0 "As Josef I von Österreich-Toskana is the new King of Italy and also the Grand Duke of Tuscany, some have proposed moving the capital from Rome to Florence. This move will probably be viewed favourably by the Austrians, but also with stern opposition by the Italians (especially considering that the Pope will remain in Rome)."
ita.4.a:0 "Roma is and will always be our capital!"
ita.4.b:0 "Firenze shall be the new capital!"
ita.5.t:0 "Donations from the Faithful"
ita.5.d:0 "With the very seat of God's church under threat from non-believers for the first time in centuries, donations have been pouring in from Catholics throughout the world."
ita.5.a:0 "Every bit counts"
ita.9.t:0 "Revolution"
ita.9.d:0 "The internal dissent has grown too far, and the people are revolting against our government, asking for democracy and free elections! What should we do? Should we suffocate the revolution on their blood or should we listen to their demands?"
ita.9.a:0 "Kill all those who oppose the government!"
ita.9.b:0 "Allow free elections"
ita.10.t:0 "War with Austria"
ita.10.d:0 "As we are now in a state of war with Austria, the demilitarised zone of Venice has become obsolete. We must move troops in to protect it at once."
ita.10.a:0 "I should say so!"
ita.12.t:0 "A King for Italy"
ita.12.d:0 "Pope [Root.GetLeader] has decreed that the monarchy in Italy is to be restored. The question remains, however: who shall become king? The two suitable candidates are Amedeo of Savoia-Aosta and Josef von Österreich-Toskana. The House of Savoia-Aosta is the cadet branch of the House of Savoia. Although the main branch was exiled after the Weltkrieg and is generally hated and despised by the population, Amedeo is popular and well-liked. On the other hand, Joseph is not only the Grand Duke of Tuscany and an Archduke of Austria, he is also a valuable military leader."
ita.12.a:0 "Amedeo of Savoia-Aosta"
ita.12.b:0 "Josef von Österreich-Toskana"
ita.13.t:0 "Democratic Elections"
ita.13.d:0 "Since we now are a democratic country, it is time for free elections! There are four parties at the election: the Italian Popular Party (Partito Popolare Italiano) led by De Gasperi and Gronchi, the Liberal Party (Partito Liberale) lead by Bonomi and Ruini, the Democratic Party (Partito Democratico) led by Orlando and Parri and the Italian Socialist Party (Partito Socialista Italiano) led by Secchia and Vassalli. Who will win the elections?"
ita.13.a:0 "The Italian Popular Party (Social-Conservative)!"

ita.14.d:0 "While our southern enemies are gone, we still have not reunified Italy. Even so, it does mean that the lingering question of our divided nation has been put to rest."
ita.14.a:0 "That's a start, at least"
ita.15.t:0 "A Proposal from the North"
ita.15.d:0 "[From.GetNameDef] has approached us and, together with the congratulations for our new government, has asked if we wish to become a part of their country. They believe we can achieve a peaceful unification through negotiations. What should we answer?"
ita.15.a:0 "Accept, for a new united Italy!"
ita.15.b:0 "No, we will never be ruled by you!"
ita.16.t:0 "The South Accepted our Proposal!"
ita.16.d:0 "The government of [From.GetNameDef] has accepted our proposal! Despite some grumbling, a new united Italy is born!"
ita.16.a:0 "Time to look beyond the peninsula!"
ita.17.t:0 "The South Rejected our Proposal"
ita.17.d:0 "The stupid politicians in [From.GetNameDef] have refused to accept our proposal, determined to keep Italy split in two. Already there are people in the street demanding that we do something to put an end to this foolishness."
ita.17.a:0 "Let's not be rash..."
ita.17.b:0 "They are absolutely right!"
ita.18.t:0 "Italy Seeks to Join Faction"
ita.18.d:0 "[From.GetNameDef] has sent diplomats, seeking to join the [Root.GetAdjective]-led faction for the benefit of both parties. Failing that, they request [Root.GetNameDef]'s protection, and in return will allow [Root.GetAdjective] troops access through their territory."
ita.18.a:0 "Admit them into the faction"
ita.18.b:0 "We will guarantee their independence instead"
ita.18.c:0 "They are on their own"
ita.19.t:0 "Italy Seeks Protection"
ita.19.d:0 "[From.GetNameDef] has sent diplomats, seeking Root.GetNameDef]'s protection of their borders, and in return will allow [Root.GetAdjective] troops access through their territory."
ita.19.a:0 "That sounds like an excellent deal"
ita.19.b:0 "They are on their own"
ita.20.t:0 "[From.GetName] Agrees"
ita.20.d:0 "[From.GetNameDef] has agreed that [Root.GetNameDef] will be a useful addition to their faction. An alliance between the two nations has now been created."
ita.20.a:0 "We have thrown our lot in with theirs..."
ita.21.t:0 "[From.GetAdjective] Protection"
ita.21.d:0 "[From.GetNameDef] has offered [From.GetAdjective] protection of [Root.GetNameDef] continued independence, in exchange for military access through our territory."
ita.21.a:0 "That sounds like a good deal"
ita.22.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses"
ita.22.d:0 "Diplomats from [From.GetNameDef] have refused any offers of alliance or requests for the protection of [Root.GetAdjective] independence. We are on our own."
ita.22.a:0 "So be it"
ita.23.t:0 "[new_italian_core.GetName] Under Our Control"
ita.23.d:0 "Our control over [new_italian_core.GetName] has finally been consolidated! It is now considered an integral part of [Root.GetNameDef]."

ita.26.t:0 "King [From.GetLeader] Visits Austria"
ita.26.d:0 "The recently-crowned king of Italy, King [From.GetLeader], has made an official state visit to Austria to meet with the Emperor in order to engineer better ties with our nation."
ita.26.a:0 "What a lovely visit!"
ita.26.b:0 "We will ensure Italy's continued independence"
ita.26.c:0 "We will return Venetia to our faithful allies"
ita.27.t:0 "King [Root.GetLeader] Visits Austria"
ita.27.d:0 "The recently-crowned king of Italy, King [From.GetLeader], has made an official state visit to Austria to meet with the Emperor in order to engineer better ties between our countries."
ita.27.a:0 "That's it? Nothing else?"
ita.28.t:0 "King [Root.GetLeader] Visits Austria"
ita.28.d:0 "The recently-crowned king of Italy, King [From.GetLeader], has made an official state visit to Austria to meet with the Emperor in order to engineer better ties between our countries. He returns to Italy with assurances from Austria that they will fight to guarantee our future independence."
ita.28.a:0 "That's something, I suppose"
ita.29.t:0 "King [Root.GetLeader] Visits Austria"
ita.29.d:0 "The recently-crowned king of Italy, King [From.GetLeader], has made an official state visit to Austria to meet with the Emperor in order to engineer better ties between our countries. He returns to Italy having won the return of lands in Venetia and assurances of support from Austria."
ita.29.a:0 "Well done!"
ita.30.t:0 "Black Monday hits [Root.GetName]!"
ita.30.d:0 "Almost two weeks ago, the Berlin Stock Exchange plunged into bottomless depth, throwing Germany's economy into an unprecedented crisis. Now the crash's shock waves have reached [Root.GetName]. German and Austrian-owned companies have closed down or laid-off their workers, the Italian lira is losing value, and industrial exports are shrinking..."
ita.30.a:0 "Let's hope the government will save us from the worst..."
ita.31.t:0 "The Pontine Marshes"
ita.31.d:0 "The order has been given to clear the Pontine Marshes and thus open the once-useless land for farming or industry. The plan will require the employment of thousands of Italians and take many months to get the bulk of it done, but the outcome may be worth it."
ita.31.a:0 "So long as it keeps them working, I'm happy"
ita.32.t:0 "The Pontine Marshes are Cleared"
ita.32.d:0 "The areas formerly known as the Pontine Marshes are now cleared, with factories and farms springing up throughout the area. More importantly is the hope this brings to the nation, that the malaise hanging over [Root.GetName] by the effects of Black Monday might one day actually come to an end."
ita.32.a:0 "A monumental achievement!"
ita.33.t:0 "Worsening Economic Conditions"
ita.33.d:0 "The economic fallout from Black Monday is getting worse day by day, as we underestimated its initial effects and took limited action to counter them. There are some laissez faire economists who argue that nothing should be done and that the market will recover itself eventually. There are others among the Church who advocate a continuation of a campaign started by Pius XI for the creation of Catholic corporations: they would be structured, organised and controlled with our support, and lead to the creation of many new independent unions that support workers. Some believe that will give rise to more syndicalist sentiment, however."
ita.33.a:0 "Support and organise the Catholic Corporations"
ita.33.b:0 "Put more people to work, no matter the cost"
ita.33.c:0 "Allow the creation of non-catholic unions"
ita.33.e:0 "Do nothing, let the market recover itself"
ita.34.t:0 "The Economy Recovers"
ita.34.d:0 "The bad effects of Black Monday have finally disappeared: we can look at the future with hope. The economy is finally recovered!"
ita.34.a:0 "The Catholic Corporations saved the country!"
ita.34.b:0 "The market recovered on its own!"
ita.34.c:0 "The trade unions saved the country!"
ita.34.e:0 "The work programs seem to have done the trick!"
ita.35.t:0 "Stage 1"
ita.35.d:0 "The first part of the National development program consists of government making use of the most modern, even experimental techniques for the construction. This will help us in the future."
ita.35.a:0 "Let the work begin!"
ita.36.t:0 "Stage 2"
ita.36.d:0 "The second part of the National development program includes construction of the so called 'Culture houses'. They will function as a way to boost the national pride of our people. The construction itself is bound to make the people content with the government."
ita.36.a:0 "Let´s continue!"
ita.37.t:0 "Stage 3"
ita.37.d:0 "The third part of the National development program has technically been going on since the programs initiation, but now that the rest of the work is done, the progress can accelerate. This part consists of various efforts of land clearance, such as the clearance of Pontine marshes. This will enable us to improve our long-term industrial potential."
ita.37.a:0 "Yes, do it!"
ita.38.t:0 "National Construction Program Finished"
ita.38.d:0 "The program has been a great success! Not only the population likes the results, but, perhaps even more importantly, the government does. Now, it is time to put our effort elsewhere."
ita.38.a:0 "Great job, guys!"
ita.41.t:0 "The Death of Pius XI"
ita.41.d:0 "With the passing of the Pope, what action should we take? Mourn the Pope's death or attempt to install the loyal Duke Giuseppe di Toscana on the throne? Doing so would make [From.GetName] a puppet of Austria, though it would greatly displease the many Catholics of our nation."
ita.41.a:0 "Send our Condolences to Rome"
ita.41.b:0 "Press the claims of Duke Giuseppe di Toscana"
ita.42.t:0 "Austria Interferes!"
ita.42.d:0 "[From.GetName] is insisting on the installation of Duke Giuseppe di Toscana as King of Italy, interfering with the Papal Election."
ita.42.a:0 "An emergency conclave elects Cardinal Innitzer as Julius IV"
ita.42.b:0 "Elect Giuseppe, we are an Austrian dominion once again"
ita.42.c:0 "Innitzer will crown Giuseppe, but we shall remain independent"
ita.43.t:0 "The Papacy Under Innitzer Resists!"
ita.43.d:0 "The Papacy has defied the prospect of our noble rule, and Cardinal Innitzer has convened an emergency conclave to have himself declared Pope Julius IV. What course of action shall we take now?"
ita.43.a:0 "If they won't give their independence, we shall take it! To war!"
ita.43.b:0 "Italy is not worth the trouble, back down"
ita.43.c:0 "Beg the Papacy for forgiveness!"
ita.44.t:0 "Austria Backs Down"
ita.44.d:0 "Though we've watched the border for signs of Austrian aggression, there appears to be none. [From.GetLeader] has apparently backed away from his threat."
ita.44.a:0 "Did they think they could bully us so easily?"
ita.45.t:0 "Austria Apologies"
ita.45.d:0 "Though we were ready for an invasion, what has occurred is quite the opposite. An envoy from [From.GetNameDef] has expressed apologies from [From.GetLeader] to His Holiness for any offence, and states he will fight to protect our independence in the years to come."
ita.45.a:0 "Well that was unexpected..."
ita.46.t:0 "Italy Submits!"
ita.46.d:0 "Italy caved in to the Austrian Empire as expected, and now Duke Giuseppe sits on the Italian throne as Giuseppe I, a puppet under our benevolent rule."
ita.46.a:0 "Hurrah!"
ita.46.b:0 "Great news, in exchange we will return Venetia!"
ita.47.t:0 "Innitzer Proclaims Giuseppe as King!"
ita.47.d:0 "Duke Giuseppe has been proclaimed king, as per our demand, but Cardinal Innitzer has engineered a means to retain control over the government. Thus Italy will not be under our control, regardless of the king's true wishes."
ita.47.a:0 "We endorse this result whole-heartedly!"
ita.47.b:0 "Very well, but we shall keep our distance"
ita.47.c:0 "Demand Innitzer step down immediately!"
ita.48.t:0 "Austria Supports Italian Kingdom"
ita.48.d:0 "As Duke Giuseppe ascends to the Italian throne, Austria has sent word that they support our kingdom whole-heartedly and have offered to protect our future independence."
ita.48.a:0 "Wonderful news!"
ita.49.t:0 "Giuseppe Takes the Throne"
ita.49.d:0 "While our government worried that Austria's true plan was to take control of Italy through King Giuseppe, they have remained silent on the matter of our continued independence. [From.GetLeader] declined to attend the king'd coronation, and there has been no further contact."
ita.49.a:0 "No news is good news, right?"
ita.50.t:0 "Austria Wants Innitzer Gone!"
ita.50.d:0 "While Austria is apparently pleased with the crowning of Josef, they have shown their true colours by demanding Innitzer step down from the Papacy and for Cardinal Elia Dalla Costa to replace him!"
ita.50.a:0 "Refuse and overthrow the false king!"
ita.50.b:0 "As our new overlords wish..."
ita.55.t:0 "The Papal Conclave"
ita.55.d:0 "The Holy See has finally came together to deliberate the election of a new Pope following Pius XI's death. In the end they choose to..."

ita.55.b:0 "...elect the charitable Elia Cardinal dalla Costa as Stephen X"
ita.55.c:0 "...elect the socialist cardinal, Achille Liènart, as John XXIII"
ita.55.e:0 "...elect the hardliner Theodor Cardinal Innitzer as Julius IV"
ita.56.t:0 "Condemn Pope [From.GetLeader]?"
ita.56.d:0 "A conclave has elected Pope [From.GetLeader] as the head of the Catholic Church, and thus the ruler of northern Italy. We should condemn him as a potential danger to our nation, but the majority of our people are Catholic and might be upset. Even so, should we stand by and watch our own brethren be brainwashed into such unjust rule?"
ita.56.a:0 "Religion is - always had been - the enemy of the Proletariat"
ita.56.b:0 "No, Pope [From.GetLeader] is a socialist and friend of the Republic"
ita.56.c:0 "Maybe we can come to terms with this new Pope?"
ita.57.t:0 "The Commune Condemns the Pope"
ita.57.d:0 "Reacting to the recent ascension of Pope [Root.GetLeader], the Syndicalist Italian Commune in the south has condemned the Holy Father and the Church in a public speech. We must react to this insult."
ita.57.a:0 "Issue an encyclical against syndicalism"
ita.57.b:0 "Love thy enemies"
ita.58.t:0 "Papal Encyclical Against Syndicalism"

ita.58.a:0 "Confiscate church property!"
ita.58.b:0 "Let this go no further"
ita.59.t:0 "The Catholic Exodus"
ita.59.d:0 "Ever since our government began its crackdown on Catholics, many people have begun to emigrate north into [ITA.GetNameDef]. The main artery for this so-called 'exodus' is, apparently, the small border port of Anzio."
ita.59.a:0 "Seal off the border and occupy Anzio"
ita.59.b:0 "Less drastic measures will have to be employed"
ita.60.t:0 "The Exodus"
ita.60.d:0 "Ever since the Catholic Church issued its encyclical against Syndicalism, thousands of our faithful brothers in the south have fled north to liberty."
ita.60.a:0 "Welcome!"
ita.61.t:0 "The Battle of Anzio"
ita.61.d:0 "In responce to the mass flight of Catholic faithful north, the syndicalists of [From.GetNameDef] sealed the border. In the early morning hours of the following day, [From.GetAdjective] troops attacked Anzio - a main artery of the exodus and are quickly overrunning the city. We can either let this happen or meet force with force!"
ita.61.a:0 "We have lost this battle"
ita.61.b:0 "Deus vult!"
ita.62.t:0 "The Battle of Anzio"
ita.62.d:0 "Our troops have successfully occupied Anzio, while our losses were very light. [From.GetNameDef] is, it seems, too afraid of our power to oppose us in any meaningful way."
ita.62.a:0 "Excellent"
ita.63.t:0 "Syndicalist Agitation"
ita.63.d:0 "While support in [ITA.GetNameDef] for the syndicalist cause is minimal, there have been growing rallies in the southern part of the country claiming that [SRI.GetNameDef] has been unfairly demonized by the papacy, and that Italian workers will only see improvement under a syndicalist government. The rallies have been tied to an increasing number of outbreaks of violence, and investigators are convinced the southern government is behind it all. It seems we are left with no choice but to face these rebels head-on."
ita.63.a:0 "We shall do so swiftly"
ita.64.t:0 "Syndicalist Bombing!"
ita.64.d:0 "The socialist rebels have targeted a factory in [attack_state.GetName], causing a great deal of damage and the loss of many lives. Italian investigators are on the scene, and claim they are closer to catching the ringleaders behind the rebels than they were before."

ita.65.t:0 "Syndicalist Bombing!"
ita.65.d:0 "The socialist rebels have targeted an arms factory in [attack_state.GetName], causing a great deal of damage and the loss of many lives. Italian investigators are on the scene, and claim they are closer to catching the ringleaders behind the rebels than they were before."

ita.66.23.d:0 "The socialist rebels have set off a series of bombs in the [attack_state.GetName] region, causing considerable damage to the roads system and traffic snarls for miles. Italian investigators are on the scene, and claim they are closer to catching the ringleaders behind the rebels than they were before."
ita.67.t:0 "Ringleaders Apprehended!"
ita.67.d:0 "Earlier today, several of the ringleaders behind the syndicalist agitation were apprehended by Italian investigators. This is a serious blow to the rebels, and brings the country one step closer to eliminating them for good."
ita.67.d.last:0 "Earlier today, the last of the ringleaders behind the syndicalist agitation were apprehended by Italian investigators. This puts an end to the group's operations within [ITA.GetNameDef], and an example will be made of the men to ensure that no other socialists get similar ideas in the future."
ita.67.a:0 "The sooner, the better!"
ita.67.b:0 "Finally!"
ita.68.t:0 "Syndicalist Agitation in the North"
ita.68.d:0 "It appears our efforts to establish greater syndicalist support in [ITA.GetNameDef] have met with success - there have been numerous socialist rallies in the southern part of their nation, which have grown to the point where there is now violent support to overthrow the papacy. We shall see how long this impedes their progress."
ita.68.a:0 "Our support for the rebels will certainly help"
ita.69.t:0 "Last Syndicalists Arrested"
ita.69.d:0 "It appears the last of the ringleaders behind the syndicalist agitation in [ITA.GetNameDef] have finally been arrested by the Italian government. The rebels did some damage, however, and we shall have to be content with the demonstration they made."

ita.73.d:0 "The stubborn [From.GetAdjective] government has refused to comply with our demands. With our troops mobilised on their border, this is the perfect moment to move into the disputed territories and seize them. International condemnation of our acts is a sure side-effect of this, however."
