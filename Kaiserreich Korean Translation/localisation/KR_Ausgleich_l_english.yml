### Kickoff Event ###
ausgleich.1.t:0 "The 1937 Ausgleich"
ausgleich.1.d:0 "The Ausgleich was a constitutional compromise between Austria and Hungary, negotiated in 1867 after the disastrous results of the war with Prussia, which established the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary. Every ten years when the compromise was renegotiated an internal crisis was triggered. After the dismal 1927 renegotiation of the compromise, the Hungarians have been emboldened. They have escalated their demands since the previous Ausgleich, seeking more influence within the central government. It is now time for the 1937 renegotiation of the Ausgleich."

### News Event About Centralised Austria ###
ausgleich.4.t:0 "Austria Reunified!"
ausgleich.4.d:0 "Despite the victory in the Weltkrieg, the Austro-Hungarian Empire appeared to be bound to collapse. The Ausgleich of 1927, negotiated when Emperor Otto was still a child, managed to preserve it, though, via granting extensive rights to most of the minorities in the Empire. However, the Hungarians were angered by this fact and sought to establish a domineering position in the Empire, while the Habsburgs were still interested in retaining that role. \n\nThe Ausgleich of 1937, however, has favoured the Austrians. After negotiations, the Hungarians surprisingly agreed to fold to the Habsburgs and join the Empire directly. Austria is now undergoing a centralisation process that might result in a new superpower being born..."

ausgleich.17.t:0 "The second round of negotiations"
ausgleich.17.d:0 "The arrogant Magyars have rejected our proposal! Several ministers are suggesting we offer the Hungarians Bosnia to placate them. Many officers are calling for preparations of a punitive war against Hungary for this insult. What shall we do?"

ausgleich.17.b:0 "Offer the Status Quo."
ausgleich.17.c:0 "Offer Bosnia to them."

ausgleich.18.t:0 "The second round of negotiations"
ausgleich.18.d:0 "To save face from their earlier demand the Austrians are now offering that the Status Quo be maintained. It's clear that they are afraid of the Hungarian nation, many within our government are calling for the end of our involvement in the Empire. More level headed ministers are advising we accept the Austrian offer. What shall we do?"

ausgleich.19.a:0 "Okay."

### Offer Bosnia ###
ausgleich.20.t:0 "The second round of negotiations"
ausgleich.20.d:0 "The second round of negotiations have begun and the Austrians have offered us Bosnia to join our half of the Empire. While this is an insulting offer we may have to accept it since rejection could mean that the Germans interfere again. What should we do?"
ausgleich.20.a:0 "Accept the offer."
ausgleich.20.b:0 "This is a paltry offer!"

ausgleich.21.t:0 "What to do with Bosnia"
ausgleich.21.d:0 "Now that we control Bosnia the question as to what to do with it has surfaced. Many ministers wish to give it to the Croatian government to placate them. However many other ministers wish to merely keep Bosnia under its current government. A small minority wish to end Bosnia's autonomy and directly add it to our Kingdom. What shall we do?"
ausgleich.21.a:0 "Give it to Croatia."
ausgleich.21.b:0 "Keep Bosnia as it is."
ausgleich.21.c:0 "Annex it."

ausgleich.22.t:0 "Bosnia is now ours"
ausgleich.22.d:0 "The Magyars, after gaining Bosnia from the Austrians, have given it to us. While the majority of our ministers wish to add it directly to our nation a dissenting minority wish to make it an autonomous state. What shall we do?"
ausgleich.22.a:0 "Welcome home brothers!"
ausgleich.22.b:0 "The second round of negotiations."

ausgleich.23.t:0 "Ausgleich Keeps the Status Quo"
ausgleich.23.d:0 "Despite the victory in the Weltkrieg, the Austro-Hungarian Empire appeared to be bound to collapse. The Ausgleich of 1927, negotiated when Emperor Otto was still a child, managed to preserve it, though, via granting extensive rights to most of the minorities in the Empire. However, the Hungarians were angered by this fact and sought to establish a domineering position in the Empire, while the Habsburgs were still interested in retaining that role. \n\nDespite high hopes placed towards it, the Ausgleich of 1937 failed to achieve a reconciliation. The Hungarians declined any Austrian offers of unification, and Bosnia had to be offered to them to keep the Magyars in the Empire. The sick giant of the Balkans lives on for another day, at least."
ausgleich.23.a:0 "Will see what the future holds."

### Reform the Dual Monarchy ###
ausgleich.24.t:0 "Austria wants to reform the Dual Monarchy"
ausgleich.24.d:0 "The Ausgleich was the compromise between Austria and Hungary in 1867. Every 10 years the terms of the compromise were renegotiated. Austria has chosen to maintain the dual-monarchy of Austria-Hungary. They proposal is tied to a number of reforms for all parts of the Empire. Most of them sound reasonable. What should we decide on?"
ausgleich.24.a:0 "Dualism has been good to us."
ausgleich.24.b:0 "Its time to break free!"

ausgleich.25.t:0 "Hungarians agree to reform"
ausgleich.25.d:0 "The Hungarian government has agreed on reforming the Dual-Monarchy. A great future lies before us."
ausgleich.25.a:0 "Lang lebe der Kaiser."

ausgleich.26.t:0 "Dual Monarchy Reformed!"
ausgleich.26.d:0 "Despite the victory in the Weltkrieg, the Austro-Hungarian Empire appeared to be bound to collapse. The Ausgleich of 1927, negotiated when Emperor Otto was still a child, managed to preserve it, though, via granting extensive rights to most of the minorities in the Empire. However, the Hungarians were angered by this fact and sought to establish a domineering position in the Empire, while the Habsburgs were still interested in retaining that role. \n\nMany placed their hopes on the Ausgleich of 1937 to restore the Empire, and it appears that those hopes were fulfilled. Austria and Hungary have reunited under the Austro-Hungarian banner and declared the reformation of the Dual Monarchy."
ausgleich.26.a:0 "Good for them."

### Federate the Empire ###
ausgleich.27.t:0 "The Austrians want to federate the Dual Monarchy"
ausgleich.27.d:0 "The Ausgleich was the compromise between Austria and Hungary in 1867. Every 10 years the terms of the compromise were renegotiated. Austria wants to federate Austria-Hungary resulting in a loss of power for us and for more regions of the empire to gain semi-autonomy."
ausgleich.27.a:0 "Agree and federate the Kingdom."
ausgleich.27.b:0 "Never."

ausgleich.28.t:0 "The Magyars agree to federate"
ausgleich.28.d:0 "The Magyars have agreed to federate; in effect dissolving the empire in favour of a federal government."

ausgleich.29.t:0 "The Birth of the Danubian Federation"
ausgleich.29.d:0 "Despite the victory in the Weltkrieg, the Austro-Hungarian Empire appeared to be bound to collapse. The Ausgleich of 1927, negotiated when Emperor Otto was still a child, managed to preserve it, though, via granting extensive rights to most of the minorities in the Empire. However, the Hungarians were angered by this fact and sought to establish a domineering position in the Empire, while the Habsburgs were still interested in retaining that role. \n\nThe Ausgleich of 1937, however, brought about an unexpected result. Hungary and Austria accepted a reform plan in the Empire, abolishing the Monarchy and declaring the beginning of the democratic Danubian Federation."
ausgleich.29.a:0 "Interesting."

ausgleich.30.b:0 "The empire has fallen."

ausgleich.31.t:0 "Crisis on the Danube"
ausgleich.31.d:0 "Austria and Hungary have broken off negotiations with each other! We should probably intervene in order to prevent another war in Europe. It's clear the status quo will not solve this so we have to favour one side over the other."

However, the Hungarians were angered by this fact and sought to establish a domineering position in the Empire, while the Habsburgs were still interested in retaining that role. \n\nMany put high hopes on the Ausgleich of 1937 to preserve the monarchy, but it appears that all diplomacy has failed.
