submarine_1_desc:0 "While there had been several earlier attempts to create submersible weapons of war, the first successful and reproducible submersible warships were produced in the early 1900s. Only capable of brief submersion, and very lightly armed, these designs were more of a proof of concept than real combat-capable warships."
submarine_2_desc:0 "The first submersible warships actually capable of effective combat actions, these designs were significant improvements over their predecessors. With diesel-electric engines replacing the primarily petrol-electric engines of the first submarines, they had greatly improved range and surface speed. In combat with enemy warships, they acted mainly as submersible light torpedo boats, but lacked the submerged speed or endurance to remain underwater for more than relatively brief periods. These were the submarines that were used by the major naval powers during the Weltkrieg."
submarine_3_desc:0 "With increased range and open-ocean capabilities, these ships incorporated the lessons of the Weltkrieg, becoming more able to serve roles such as fleet scouting and long-range patrols, as well as being more potent in tasks such as merchant ship hunting."
submarine_4_desc:0 "Significantly larger than preceding submarines, some of these designs were of 'cruiser' type, designed for long-range independent operations in commerce raiding and intended to be better equipped to handle combat with enemy light warships while surfaced. As such, they carried heavier gun armament, and had improved surface speed. Their submerged capabilities, however, remained limited."
submarine_5_desc:0 "The evolution of the 'cruiser' submarine designs, some of these warships took those ideas further, with larger guns and a greater emphasis on surface abilities, while others began to look in the other direction, seeking to increase underwater capabilities and performance."
submarine_6_desc:0 "The gains made by some earlier designs in extending underwater range, speed, and overall abilities, led to the turn in submarine development away from 'cruiser' types and back towards vessels with a greater emphasis on underwater capabilities. Vastly improved over earlier types, these submarines carried potent payloads of torpedoes and were a legitimate threat to almost all surface ships. However, they were still limited in submerged duration, range, and speed, and remained vulnerable when surfaced, especially to aircraft."
submarine_7_desc:0 "With greatly increased battery capacity, advanced systems to refresh air while still submerged, and overall refined designs, these were the first submarines intended to be able to remain submerged for most of the duration of their time at sea. As such, they marked a massive shift in naval warfare, and the ascendancy of submarines to being true terrors. Such warships offered the ability to dominate the oceans to those nations that developed and deployed them."

destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Torpedo Boat Destroyer was the earliest form of destroyer, with the first designs created in 1892. Aimed at protecting the fleet from torpedo boat encounters, these designs were effectively enlarged torpedo boats, designed to be faster and more heavily armed, while still possessing the torpedo attack potential of the torpedo boat. Ships of this type were typically 300-600 tons, and travelled at a top speed of around 26 knots, while carrying a pair of torpedoes and a small armament of guns."
destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg brought a new demand for destroyers: not only were they required to protect their fleets, but they were also stretched thin to protect the Entente shipping lines as well. To meet this need, destroyer designs were streamlined, entering mass production to keep up with demand. Ships of this era were typically 1000 tons, and travelled at a top speed of 34 knots, while carrying a larger pair of torpedoes than their forebears."
destroyer_3_desc:0 "As fleets grew in size and destroyer detachments roamed further from bases, there became a demand for a larger ship to lead the destroyer flotillas, with more advanced equipment to provide improved command and control techniques. These ships, while revolutionarily useful and powerful at their time, were rendered obsolete by the integration of their technologies into most later destroyer designs. Ships of this type were generally 50% heavier than their charges, mostly to make room for communications equipment, proper officer quarters, and extra guns."
destroyer_4_desc:0 "After the Weltkrieg, both England and Germany continued mass production of older models of destroyer with only slight improvements. It was not until the collapse of the British government and the end of the dreadnought race that navies worldwide began to analyse in-depth the lessons of the Weltkrieg, and how they might be applied to radically improve existing designs. Larger, improved rangefinders and new anti-submarine weapons were fitted, and multiple torpedo launcher tubes were mounted to improve their combat capability. While the overall size of these destroyers was not much larger than their predecessors, they were significantly more useful with a longer range, better armament, and faster speed."
destroyer_5_desc:0 "By 1935, with increasingly potent new aircraft designs entering service, as well as several navies deploying fleet carriers, while there was still some doubt about just how useful the carriers would be in open warfare, concern over the potential threat that aircraft might pose to warships was growing. German carrier operations during the Chinese intervention and continued British exercises had shown the world that the carrier had a purpose in the navy. As a result, this era of destroyer saw the introduction of the dual purpose primary armament, granting a vastly improved anti-aircraft role to the destroyer, again increasing their usefulness. Theses ships would displace up to 2,500 tons, often carrying increased payloads of torpedoes to offset the reduced torpedo loadout on more modern cruisers."
destroyer_6_desc:0 "With the start of the Second Weltkrieg the world's navies needed cheap anti-aircraft platforms. The British success with carrier combat had shown the world that they were suited for more than just recon and anti-carrier duties, they were required for modern anti-capital ship warfare. Advanced anti-submarine technologies like the new hedgehog depth charges were playing an essential role in combating the major threat to convoy operations, they and the anti-aircraft platforms intensified demands for more destroyers. Were previously destroyer investments were being lowered in favour of cruisers and the new armoured cruisers, destroyers began to return to the fore as an essential part of both the fleet, and the convoy system. While often not larger than their predecessors they were far more technologically advanced, mostly adopting flush decks and far larger torpedo armaments."
destroyer_7_desc:0 "Near the end of the Second Weltkrieg, the navies of the world were forced to adapt: new submarines could stay submerged for almost indefinite periods of time, carriers were loaded full of planes more than capable of destroying capital ships, and big gun cruisers were quickly becoming irrelevant in the face of carriers and submarines. The future role of the escort for the main fleet was being taken over almost solely by destroyers in the minds of most naval theorists, with dual purpose rapid firing turrets destroying any planes that dare cross her path in an attempt to dive bomb her. The displacement of these vessels rose as well, often coming up to 3,000 tons as designers loaded them with more and more anti-aircraft weapons, as well as more primary guns."

light_cruiser_7:0 "현대 순양함 (1944)"
light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Designed with armoured decks but not sides, protected cruisers were common in the navies of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These ships were lighter, faster, and cheaper alternatives to armoured cruisers designed for trade protection and fleet scouting. They were generally armed with 6 inch or equivalent guns."
light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Better quality armour and the development of steam turbine engines led to the rise of light armoured cruisers. Faster and better protected than protected cruisers, these designs came to supplant them in the 1910s."
light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The development of cruisers continued during the Weltkrieg, generally trending towards considerably faster designs with heavier firepower."
light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "After the end of the Dreadnought Race, most major navies found themselves dealing with reduced budgets and political resistance to the construction of new capital warships. The perceived success of the 7.5 inch guns on the British Hawkins class cruiser during the Second Battle of Jutland during combat with German cruisers and destroyers, as well as a German demand for long-range cruisers, had created a new demand for a larger, more expensive cruiser than the smaller designs seen as most successful during the war. This forced the existing trends in cruiser development towards larger and more heavily armed ships with a much longer range. These ships were the result, with a considerable jump in size over the cruisers of the Weltkrieg. Their increased armour (generally 8 inch or equivalent) made them considerably more potent than the preceding cruiser designs, and would set the standard for cruiser design going forward."
light_cruiser_5_desc:0 "The interwar period saw refinements of larger cruisers that had appeared since the Dreadnought Race. With politics and finances still constraining many naval powers, the designs produced were only marginally larger in size than the previous generation, instead seeing upgrades in firepower through the use of eight inch guns or the growing adoption of triple turrets and quadruple torpedo tubes. With the importance of aircraft growing in naval warfare, anti-aircraft armament was also considered, leading to the adoption of high-angle dual-purpose mounts for three-five inch guns, supplemented by a growing array of autocannons."
light_cruiser_6_desc:0 "Thanks to increased available funding, the new cruisers built at the end of the interwar period and the beginning of the Second Weltkrieg saw another slight growth in their size. Once more, while the the primary armament's calibre remained, with few exceptions, in the 7-8 inch range, their firepower was increased further by adding an extra turret or raising the number of guns in each turret if that had not been done in the previous generation. Secondary armaments were further upgraded with further twin dual-purpose guns and even more dedicated anti-aircraft armament, often linked with improved fire controls. This generation also saw the growing adoption of radar systems on cruisers."
light_cruiser_7_desc:0 "The cruisers of the late-war and early post-war period remained similar to the ones of the early war, while incorporating the numerous lessons learned throughout. With air power confirmed to be one of the greatest threats to ships, designers focused on improving AA capabilities even further through better fire-control, improving coordination between batteries and radar. Some navies also experimented with autoloading mechanisms for the main armament, dramatically improving their rates of fire. The rapid pace of rocket and missile development would eventually prove to be the demise of all-gun ships, including cruisers, making this the last generation of 'old type' cruisers for numerous navies."

heavy_cruiser_6:0 "현대 장갑순양함 (1944)"
heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Armoured cruisers were designed to act as independent, long-range, warships, capable of defeating anything less than a battleship and of outrunning battleships. Most carried 8 inch or equivalent guns."
heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "As armoured cruiser design advanced, they were intended to be auxiliaries to larger, more heavily armed, battleships, and to supplement them, accomplishing tasks for which battleships were not required."
heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "In the wake of the Revolution in France, the republican government was left deeply concerned about the shipbuilding capabilities of the Commune. Lacking any real ship production facilities and possessing a limited budget, they were forced to place orders internationally, with the now empty naval yards of the Two Sicilies. Their design was intended as an intermediate class, with the guns and range to fight older battleships on their own terms as well as the speed to chase down lighter cruisers and escape the more modern battleships they had no chance of beating themselves. Quickly nations such as Ukraine, Austria, and the Two Sicilies received several orders for more ships of this variety, saving the shipbuilding facilities and experience these nations could no longer afford to sustain, and seeing a burst in construction at the birth of this new design type."
heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "After the initial wave of armoured cruiser orders from second-rate powers across the world, the design was thoroughly inspected for improvement potential. Better rangefinders were implemented, improvements in triple barreled turret designs were made to reduce weight and improve armour, and additional space was made for more floatplanes to be added to improve the recon ability of the ship. This new generation of designs was widely adopted by South America, where a second naval race had begun to fracture national budgets, as rich nations like Venezuela poured wealth into improving their fleets in the wake of the Chilean revolution."
heavy_cruiser_5_desc:0 "Progress in Armoured Cruiser design came with a reevaluation of the role of these ships, and with adjustments in the trajectory of previous developments. While they retained the mediocre armour of their predecessors, these ships changed course on the path of their guns, generally moving to reduce barrel diameter in favor of gun designs with increased velocity. Most were armed with six main guns, in double or triple turrets, and most of those guns were 11-12 inches or equivalent."
heavy_cruiser_6_desc:0 "The evolution of the armoured cruiser, by the mid-1940s, had reached its apex: ships with the speed to hunt cruisers but the firepower to threaten true capital warships enough to keep them on their toes. While the firepower of the ships was less useful with the rise of the Carrier, they found great use in shore bombardment and carrier escort duties. Functionally greatly enlarged cruisers with much heavier armour and guns, most of these ships were armed with six to nine main guns of 11-12 inch or equivalent size; these were extremely high velocity gun designs, allowing for the armour penetration and range to engage battleships respectably while also functioning as an effective lone convoy raider more than capable of dealing with escorting destroyers and lighter cruisers."

battleship_1_desc:0 "The early British battlecruiser was an innovative design for its time, expanding upon the larger armoured cruiser with its primary armament all one calibre, while keeping the speed of cruisers, The battlecruiser was designed to be the ultimate in convoy defence and raiding, while also having the ability to perform on the line of battle if needed. Early battlecruiser designs favoured light armour and high speeds as well as lighter gun calibres; the flaws of these earlier designs was shown at Jutland, where their armour proved utterly insufficient to perform on the line and many of these early, British-styled, battlecruisers were destroyed."
battleship_2_desc:0 "While the British built their early battlecruisers for speed and weight of fire, the Germans built their Battlecruisers for staying in the line of battle. This style of battlecruiser usually had a somewhat lighter calibre of gun and slower speed, but much heavier armour, making them more fit for staying in the line of battle as a second-rate battleship. The first Battle of Jutland showed the success of this design; the German battlecruisers were much better equipped for a sustained fight than their British counterparts and did significant damage to the British squadrons. Ships of this type were generally armed with 11 to 12 inch guns."
battleship_3_desc:0 "After the First Battle of Jutland design decisions were changed, and ships already laid down had their designs revised. The thin armour previously associated with earlier battlecruiser designs was scrapped and extra armour added. In Britain the Admiral class had her armour improved, and production was expedited upon the news that Germany had restarted her production program. The Germans meanwhile prioritised the construction of the Mackensen class after the cessation of unrestricted submarine warfare. The Japanese were ahead of the curve, with their Kongo class already having many features of these later designs. Several ships of these classes were damaged or destroyed at the Second Battle of Jutland, where the British battlecruiser fleet was badly mauled by the German battlecruisers."
battleship_4_desc:0 "After the Second Battle of Jutland, the concept of the battlecruiser as a faster and less armoured dreadnought designed to hunt smaller ships had been tested and proved wanting. With their lighter armour the battlecruisers were not able to hold their place on the line, resulting in disastrous losses for the British at the First and Second Battle of Jutland. The heavily armoured German cruisers were adept at holding the line, but were too slow to pursue the enemy fleet even after dealing a crippling blow. The designs from considering these deficits were the 'fast battleships': a battlecruiser armoured nearly as well as a battleship, but with enough speed to chase down anything that might be able to threaten it. These designs typically featured 16 to 18 inch guns and battleship-level belt armour."
battleship_5_desc:0 "The end of the Dreadnought Race, with the start of the British Revolution, led to large scale naval construction largely ceasing, and naval funding, which had grown to enormous levels in the period up to 1925, finally collapsing. The 'Great Powers' spent the next decade slowly finishing ships already under construction, while focusing development on smaller ships that were easier to slip through the naval budgets. It wasn't until the early 30s that the Great Powers began to experiment with fast battleship designs. These battleship designs were far more modern, with improved rangefinders, powerful oil fired engines, and 16 to 18 inch guns, but were generally iterative, focusing more on delivering a powerful ship at the best price rather than being a drastic improvement over their predecessors."
battleship_6_desc:0 "With the Second Weltkrieg on the horizon and international tensions higher than ever, designers were looking to construct a new generation of ships to fight in the upcoming war. While some nations had transitioned their naval hopes to carriers, others still insisted that the carrier could only provide a supplementary role, rather than replacing the primary anti-capital ship role of the battleship. These nations, typified by Germany, instead retooled their newer designs, focusing on improved armour layouts and more effective guns and turrets, as well as improved speeds."
battleship_7_desc:0 "At the close of the Second Weltkrieg, the Great Powers were faced with an indisputable fact: naval air power had proved victorious over all gun capital ships. However, several nations persisted with the development of Battleships, as shore bombardment platforms, prestige projects and support for carriers within the fleet. Designers loaded their battleships with anti-aircraft batteries, as well as the latest anti-aircraft rocket technology. These designs would prove less than successful over the years; while many of these battleships would continue to be operated well into the 70s, they were widely viewed as obsolete, and mostly functioned to ferry Heads of State on national voyages and to occasionally provide shore bombardment support during regional conflicts."

SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The dominant warships at the dawn of the 20th century, the battleship was developed out of earlier ironclad designs. Protected by hardened steel armour, these ships carried main batteries of heavy guns along with a diverse assortment of smaller weapons intended to engage close-range targets with heavy volumes of fire. The British Majestic class was something of the 'model' exemplar of these designs, and was widely copied by other nations. While slow, they were well protected; they were armed with four 12 inch guns, as well as twelve 6 inch, sixteen 12-pounder, and twelve 3-pounder guns. Though rendered obsolete by the innovations of the Dreadnoughts, many of these ships remained in service during the Weltkrieg when several were destroyed. Most of the rest were retired from service in the years after the war ended, though a handful would remain in service for years afterwards even into the 1930s in second and third rate navies."
SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Dreadnought (constructed 1905-6) revolutionized capitol warship design, instantly rendering obsolete all previous battleships and triggering a naval arms race between Britain and Germany. Her 'all big gun' main armament was significantly more powerful than the mixed batteries of pre-Dreadnoughts, and her steam turbine propulsion granted her superior speed. Navies around the world rushed to copy the British design, leading to an explosion in naval spending and a major increase in the firepower afloat. Most were armed with ten to twelve main guns, in twin turrets, of 11 to 12 inches or equivalent."
SH_battleship_3_desc:0 "A jump in size over preceding Dreadnoughts, these 'super-Dreadnoughts' were the escalation of the design innovations of the Dreadnought designs. Faster, with heavier armour, their major distinguishing feature was their superior armament: most carried five twin turrets, with guns of 12 to 13.5 inch or equivalent, arraigned so as to allow all to fire broadside and with fore and aft turrets in a superfiring configuration. This heavier, more concentrated, firepower made them considerably more deadly than the early Dreadnought classes, and these designs would enter the Weltkrieg as the leading warships of major navies. While eclipsed by the new classes devised during the war, they remained formidable warships, and many would remain in service, especially in secondary fleets, for many years after it ended."
SH_battleship_4_desc:0 "Designed shortly before the Weltkrieg began, and completed while it raged, these classes represented the highest level of naval development prior to the start of that conflict. They were the fleet-leading warships of the war, and would remain highly potent long after it ended. While they were notably faster than the Dreadnoughts before them their most notable differentiating feature was their escalated armament: they carried eight to ten main guns, of 14 to 15 inch or equivalent, most in twin turrets but a few in new triple turrets. Their devastating firepower and heavy armour guaranteed that they would be at the heart of their battle fleets, but those continued advances came at quickly escalating prices. Even more so than the warships before them these classes demanded huge investments, though they were only shadow of what was to come."
SH_battleship_5_desc:0 "Incorporating the lessons of first real major naval battles of the Dreadnought Age, most notably the First Battle of Jutland, these designs were highly convergent: increased speed, ever heavier armour, and a main armament of four twin 16 to 16.5 inch or equivalent guns in a two fore, two aft superfiring turret configuration, though some later designs of the type added a fifth turret. Such powerful warships came at great price, and their construction exerted considerable strain on those nations that built them. While begun during the Weltkrieg none were completed in time to take part in it, and as a result their designs remained largely untested. Produced in far greater numbers than the mammoth ships that followed them, these classes would form the cores of most of the world's major navies long after the war, and all the way into the 1930s."
SH_battleship_6_desc:0 "The rapid increase of resources devoted to naval construction after the end of major land conflict during the Weltkrieg initially produced these designs, which featured the beginnings of the trends towards sudden growth in size, firepower, armour, calibre and of course, cost. Such vessels set the world's leading naval powers apart from the mere pretenders to greatness, but they had their issues; their rapid development and rushed construction led to design flaws and persistent mechanical problems. These designs were armed with eight to ten 18 inch or equivalent main guns, and had the protection to go toe-to-toe with similarly armed ships."
SH_battleship_7_desc:0 "As the Dreadnought Race reached its height, these true monsters were conceived. Far greater in size and firepower than anything that came before, their cost was staggering, and few nations could afford to even consider constructing them. Nonetheless, those that did found themselves in possession of truly mighty weapons of naval supremacy. Even more so than the generation before them, they suffered from the conditions of their conception. Rushed design work, last minute and improvised redesigns during construction, shortages of the huge amount of resources they required, immense pressure to rush construction, and the sheer size and complexity of their massive mechanisms, all led to design flaws and vulnerabilities beneath their vast armoured hides. These designs were armed with twelve to fifteen 18 inch or equivalent main guns."
SH_battleship_8_desc:0 "Once the afterglow of the great Dreadnought Race had faded away, naval designers took stock of the position of dreadnoughts in future planning. Discarding speed as a major goal, with the understanding that the new generation of so-called 'fast battleships' would assume that task, these designs instead focused on extreme, unprecedented, armour protection. Advanced 16 inch guns could equal the armour penetration of 18 inches, while being less expensive. .Drawing lessons from the navies possessing heavy ordinance most of these designs were armed with those types of advanced 16 inch guns, or equivalents, normally arranged in five triple turrets."
SH_battleship_9_desc:0 "Even as most navies, with varying degrees of reluctance and dismay, were forced to concede the ascendancy of carriers over traditional gun warships, some naval designers still dreamed of creating the 'ultimate battleship'. Girded in nearly impenetrable armour, bristling with anti-aircraft batteries, and armed with six triple 16 inch turrets or equivalent extreme armament, these designs represented the very pinnacle of heavy warship design. Conceived in the twilight of the age of gun warships, these designs were seen as obsolete even before their drafting was completed, mainly by the advocates of ascendant airpower."

heavy_carrier_1_desc:0 "The first large aircraft carriers, these ships were built on hulls that were originally intended for capital warships but, for various reasons, converted and completed as carriers. Only a handful of navies built such ships, and their designs varied greatly; their aircraft capacities ranged from the low sixties to over a hundred. There were constants though, such as retained heavily armoured belts and other gun-warship features. Semi-experimental and unreliable, they were still incredibly formidable weapons, and laid the foundations for following generations of fleet carriers."
heavy_carrier_2_desc:0 "The first fleet carriers designed entirely to be such, most of these ships were significantly smaller than their predecessors, but, due to being intentionally centered on the requirements of naval aviation, were also far more reliable in that role. With better anti-aircraft defenses and properly designed runways, they generally carried around sixty aircraft."
heavy_carrier_3_desc:0 "Continued development of fleet carrier design led to much larger models, with even higher capacities. Increased range and better design of internal systems allowed them to function more effectively as not only part of the fleet, but the centre of one. They retained the features of previous heavy carriers, large secondary batteries to engage enemy vessels at close range and a heavily armoured belt for protection. Most carried around seventy aircraft and with the new deck-edge elevators they were highly efficient at getting those craft into combat as quickly as possible."
heavy_carrier_4_desc:0 "The final pre-nuclear evolution of fleet carrier design, these ships approached the size of the first fleet carriers, while incorporating all of the design improvements made in the intervening years. Most had significant armour protection and withering AA firepower, while also being highly mechanically reliable. However, they had given up their large calibre secondary armament in exchange for dual purpose 100-127mm guns. Their general aircraft capacity was, on average, around eighty."

carrier_1_desc:0 "The first steps in naval aviation were born from the use of seaplanes. During the Weltkrieg, several navies constructed and deployed seaplane carriers, the first converted from merchant ships, and with later ones build for the purpose. While the promise of naval aviation was demonstrated by these ships and the brave aviators that were based on them, they had major restrictions, and were not effective as weapon systems. Nonetheless, the lessons learned from these early efforts would pave the way for the development of true aircraft carriers."
carrier_2_desc:0 "Having learned from the experience of using seaplane tenders, those navies with the resources to do so began work on the next generation of ships that could carry aircraft at sea. Unlike their predecessors, these carriers were designed with flight decks to allow for aircraft to both fly off of them and to then return and land on them. Converted from civilian ships and seaplane tenders, most of these ships were limited by having relatively cramped flight decks and hangars, but they definitely demonstrated that ships were capable of effectively operating air complements at sea."
carrier_3_desc:0 "Often significantly larger and having greater aircraft capacity than their predecessors, these ships were generally the first purpose-designed and built aircraft carriers. None were ready in time to take part in the battles of the Weltkrieg and their true capabilities, and that of developed naval aviation in general remained unproven, subject to great dispute and differences of opinion amongst the navies of the world. Even the most critical navies did concede that aircraft were if nothing else, useful for reconnaissance and as a result, those that had the resources built at least a few of these ships."
carrier_4_desc:0 "Developed in the late 30s, these ships were designed to provide aerial reconnaissance and light fighter coverage for fleets primarily focused on more 'conventional' warship forces. Their range was significantly increased, and efforts were made to make them fast enough to keep up with fleets operating at full speed in open oceans."
carrier_5_desc:0 "As major naval combat operations in the naval aviation age demonstrated the power of aircraft to seriously affect battles at sea, many powers found themselves having fallen behind in the development of their carrier forces. While heavy carriers were quickly shown to be the most potent of their kin, they were also massive ships that required a long time and large amount of resources to construct. In the rush to increase their ability to project air power into the oceans, several powers turned to designs like these, enlarged versions of the existing lighter carriers, to try to quickly bolster their naval aviation capacity."
carrier_6_desc:0 "Even once the dominance of heavy carriers had become indisputable, there were many powers that could not afford such ships, and even major naval powers that needed secondary carriers to cover less important naval regions. These ships were the designs that were created to fill those needs. Much smaller than the heavy carriers, they nonetheless incorporated design innovations developed from them, to produce effective smaller carriers that had respectable aircraft capacity, fast speeds, and reasonable anti-aircraft defense batteries."

AOG_battleship_1_desc:0 "Conceptualised as being a merger of armoured cruiser and battleship, with the speed of the former and firepower of the latter, battlecruisers were a British creation. The first German response to these ships was the Von der Tann, completed in 1910, was faster and better protected than the British Invincible class, though somewhat less well armed, with four twin 28cm turrets. She fought at, and survived, both battles of Jutland."
AOG_battleship_2:0 "몰트케"
AOG_battleship_2_desc:0 "While the British were producing their battlecruiser designs in significant numbers, the Germans decided to take a somewhat different path, producing battlecruisers with a greater focus on armour protection but somewhat lighter armament. Six of these ships, the Moltke (Moltke and Goeben), Seydlitz, and Derfflinger (Derfflinger, Lützow, and Hindenburg) classes, were completed during 1911-1917, and would show themselves to be considerably superior to the less well protected British battlecruisers. The Goeben would spend the war trapped in the Mediterranean, as the Ottoman ship Yavuz Sultan Selim, but the rest of the ships would serve in the major naval battles of the war. Lützow was badly damaged at the First Battle of Jutland and scuttled, while the Moltke would be lost at the Second Battle of Jutland, as the German battlecruisers conducted flanking strikes against the main body of British dreadnoughts, but the rest of these ships would survive the war, with the Goeben remaining in Ottoman service after the Weltkrieg. Their armaments were five twin 28cm turrets for the Moltke and Seydlitz classes and four twin 30.5cm turrets for the Derfflinger class."
AOG_battleship_3:0 "마켄젠"
AOG_battleship_3_desc:0 "Based on an improved Derfflinger class design with more powerful engines, increased armour and armament upgraded to four twin 35cm turrets, the Mackensen class were highly potent German battlecruisers. Intended as a class of seven ships, the last three were subsequently altered in design, leaving only the first four as Mackensens. Construction was seriously impeded by the effects of the Weltkrieg, only getting back on track in 1917, following the Kaiser's direct intervention.\nAll four ships participated in the Second Battle of Jutland, where they served with distinction, inflicting serious losses on the British battlecruiser forces present there. The Yorck class, initially intended as additional Mackensens but enlarged and upgunned to four twin 38cm turrets, were not ready in time for the Second Battle of Jutland and have been largely been overshadowed by the ships that preceded and succeeded them. Laid down in 1917, the Yorck, Gneisenau, and Scharnhorst were completed in 1921."

AOG_battleship_4_desc:0 "With the Dreadnought Race over, the German navy found itself in the mid-1920s having to consider its new role, as the guarantor, guardian, and protector of a vast global empire. To secure such a far-flung domain, ships with a balance of speed, armour and firepower as well as extensive range were required, while not being as ruinously expensive as the giants of the preceding trend. German naval architects faced this challenge by re-casting their next generation of battlecruisers into 'fast battleships'. While the Yorck class was retroactively declared to be such, the first of these under the German flag that were designed as such from the start were the Prinz Adalbert class. The first two ships of this class, the Prinz Adalbert and Hans Georg, were begun in 1926 and completed in 1930, while a third, the Friedrich Carl, was completed in 1931. A following only slightly altered class, the York class, was also constructed in 1933. These classes were armed with four twin 42cm turrets."

The Blücher class was a symbol of these efforts, and of German pride in general and gained a considerable degree of notoriety and fame. Begun in 1931, both of these ships, the Blücher and Admiral Scheer, were completed in 1935. They retained the four twin 42cm turret armament of preceding classes, but were faster and possessed of superior armour protection."

AOG_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Dreadnought (constructed 1905-6) revolutionised capitol warship design, instantly rendering obsolete all previous battleships and triggering a naval arms race between Britain and Germany. The German response, the Nassau class (Nassau, Rheinland, Posen, and Westfalen), were begun in 1907 and completed in 1910. Somewhat lighter and slower than their British counterparts, they carried smaller but more numerous guns, and their designers believed that 'weight of fire' would be more significant than range and individual shell effect (a belief they were disillusioned of after the First Battle of Jutland). They carried six twin 28cm turrets. Their immediate successors, the Helgoland, carried slightly heavier armament, with six twin 30.5cm turrets, while the following Kaiser class carried five twin 30.5cm turrets. All ships of these classes were present at both battles of Jutland, except for the König Albert, which missed the First Battle, and all thirteen survived the war."

The first two ships, the Bayern and Baden, were laid down in 1913 and completed in 1916 and 1917, respectively. The construction of the following two ships, the Sachsen and Württemberg, was significantly affected by the Weltkrieg; laid down in 1914 and 1915, they were not completed until late 1918 and early 1919, respectively, after the Kaiser had reprioritized work on them. All four would be participants in the Second Battle of Jutland, and would perform well there, though damage sustained by the Sachsen, attributed incorrectly by the British to an arias torpedo strike, would have significant consequences for the future of naval development."
AOG_SH_battleship_5:0 "프로이센"
AOG_SH_battleship_5_desc:0 "With the decision of the Kaiser to disallow unrestricted submarine warfare in January 1917, resources that might otherwise have been directed towards submarine construction were instead directed towards work on surface ships. One result of that was that a new class of dreadnoughts, armed with four twin 42cm turrets, was ordered; construction of two began in late 1917, and two more were laid down in 1918. Freed from the need to conduct major army operations after 1920, the German Empire focused its resources towards confronting its only remaining enemies, and thus began a new, large-scale, ship construction effort. Based on an enlarged Preußen hull, and with armament increased to five twin 42cm turrets, the Siegfrieds were designed to have speed, protection, and firepower, and would join with the Preußens to become the core of the German fleet. Eight of these ships were built."
AOG_SH_battleship_6:0 "도이칠란드"
AOG_SH_battleship_6_desc:0 "Designed as the response to British warships armed with 18 inch guns, the Deutschland class were themselves armed with three triple 48cm turrets, making them the first German capital ships to carry triple turrets. The cost of these ships was enormous, and many German naval planners decried them as both wasteful and the opposite of the more numerous and agile fleet Germany needed. While five of these ships were started, two in 1923 and three in 1924, once the Dreadnought Race ended the latter three were cancelled; only the Deutschland and Schlesien were completed, both in 1928."
AOG_SH_battleship_7:0 "카이저 빌헬름"
AOG_SH_battleship_7_desc:0 "The final product of the naval arms race, the Kaiser Wilhelm class was designed as a German answer to the huge British and American super-dreadnoughts and was intended to surpass them all. On an unprecedented scale for German ships, they required new construction facilities, which delayed their own construction. Armed with four triple 48cm turrets, this class was easily amongst the most powerful ever even put to paper and was designed for high speed. Her immense size would result in a seemingly unending stream of mechanical problems, even during construction, and the cost was exorbitant. Only one was ever built; begun in late 1925, she was not fully completed until 1932. While further ships of her type were planned the great difficulties of her construction and the German “victory” in the Dreadnought Race led to the German naval command to abandon such leviathan ships and focus available resources on new smaller, more economic vessels that were more suited to the demands of the new far-flung German colonial empire."

AOG_heavy_carrier_1_desc:0 "With news of large British and Japanese converted carrier designs in the later half of the 1920s, a few voices in the German navy called for possible responses. Designs were drafted to answer, and eventually resulted in a proposal to convert one of the Mackensen class battlecruisers into an aircraft carrier, with an intended complement of around 60 aircraft. While the beginnings were drawn on paper, that was as far as the proposal got: very few in the German navy believed in carrier-based planes having potential beyond reconnaissance and counter-reconnaissance, and that role was already filled by the smaller carriers of the Mainz class. As a result, German fleet carrier development was functionally nonexistent during the 1920s and into for the first half of the 1930s."
AOG_heavy_carrier_2:0 "리히트호펜"
AOG_heavy_carrier_2_desc:0 "The sudden unpleasant realization forced upon the German navy that carrier aircraft could be a potent weapon against capitol warships began a rush to rectify the German lack of fleet carriers. The Richthofen class was the result of that effort. While suffering from a lack of experience with fleet carrier operations relative to British and Japanese carriers of the same generation, the Germans were able to draw upon their experience with smaller carriers to allow them to produce a respectable design. That being said, these ships were badly rushed in construction, and suffered considerable issues. The Richthofen class was intended at design to carry almost 80 aircraft but in practice, these ships were normally able to carry approximately 60."

AOG_carrier_1_desc:0 "The first German of the German seaplane carriers, SMS Stuttgart was a converted Königsberg class cruiser, designed to support the German fleet during engagements. Together with SMS Roon a converted armoured cruiser, the two ships were present to assist the German fleet in scouting, a role they were poorly suited for given the limited radio equipment and lack of planes. The Stuttgart could carry 3 seaplanes, while the Roon carried 8."
AOG_carrier_2:0 "마인츠"
AOG_carrier_2_desc:0 "The first real German carriers, the Mainz class were intended to be experimental as well as to provide active reconnaissance for the fleet. Somewhat of a makeshift design, they combined carriage of both seaplanes and normal aircraft, and suffered from a series of early accidents and mechanical problems. Nonetheless, they eventually overcame most of those early issues, and laid the foundation for future German naval aviation. The Mainz was completed in 1925, and was followed by the Rhein and Blumenthal in 1926. These ships normally carried both 13-15 seaplanes and 9-11 wheeled aircraft."
AOG_carrier_3:0 "마스"
AOG_carrier_3_desc:0 "Design work began in the late-1920s on the next generation of German carriers. Incorporating the lessons learned from the Mainz class, these ships were intended to provide the fleet with reconnaissance and light fighter coverage. Their designs were considerably more advanced than that of their predecessor, and represented a significant advancement. Several of these ships were constructed in the early 1930s, starting with the Maas and Peter Strasser in 1931 and continuing with the Roon in 1932 and the Boelcke in 1933. Maas class carriers normally carried 18-21 aircraft."

These first battlecruisers, of the Invincible, Indefatigable, Lion, Queen Mary, and Tiger classes, had particularly light armour, with armament increasing from four twin 12 inch turrets to four twin 13.5 inch turrets as the designs progressed. In total, ten of these ships were built from 1906 to 1914.

In terms of firepower and armour, they would be superior to previous British battlecruisers, and carry three twin 15 inch turrets. Both ships of the class, the Renown and Repulse, were completed in 1916, too late in the year to fight in the First Battle of Jutland.

As a result, all four ships, the Hood, Anson, Howe, and Rodney, were completed in early-mid 1919 and present at the Second Battle of Jutland; their weak armour led to poor survivability, with both the Anson and the Rodney sunk in combat."

Sharing many characteristics with the new dreadnoughts, the Nelson class had prioritised armour protection of key systems; the ships were heavily armoured for a battlecruiser and carried heavier weapons than their predecessors, with three triple 16 inch turrets. Construction of four ships began in 1919: Nelson, Fisher, Dundonald and Cornwallis. The three ships that remained with the Republicans after the Revolution were renamed as the Marx, Odger, and Quaker.\nAs the Dreadnought Race reached its peak, the British continued efforts to rebuild their battlecruiser forces. An improved Nelson design, the Rodney class were intended to return that force to strength. Just four ships had been completed by 1924, the other four, begun in 1922 and 1923, were not yet completed when the Revolution erupted.

Due to this, these ships were significantly better protected than other contemporary designs. Increased firepower was also important and ships were armed with three triple 18 inch turrets.\nFour ships were ordered; the Magnificent and Majestic were begun in 1920 and completed in 1924, while the Illustrious and Victorious were begun in 1921 and completed in 1925.

Taken away to Canada it would be several years before the government there could afford to fully repair the damage she suffered during that initial crew combat.

The aft turret was to be kept, but test firings showed that the ship's hull was not able to handle the stress of firing such a weapon. In 1917, she was commissioned and immediately returned to the docks to have her aft turret removed and replaced by a landing deck. After brief operations in 1918 she was returned to the shipyards again in early 1919, to undergo a fuller conversion into a carrier that spared her involvement in the second battle of Jutland. This work was not completed until 1923, when she became one of Britain's first carriers.

She displaced over 6000 tons and was armed with two 24cm guns, eight 15cm guns, a wide array of tertiary guns of different calibres, and two torpedo tubes. During the Weltkrieg, the ship was mostly inactive as part of the fleet-in-being plan, as the ship was too slow to operate with the other more modern cruisers in the fleet."
AUS_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Sankt Georg"
AUS_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The SMS Sankt Georg was the third, and final, armoured cruiser in the Austro-Hungarian Kriegsmarine. Her design was slightly heavier and had stronger secondary armament and belt armour. Like her two fellow armoured cruisers she was rendered obsolete fairly quickly and relegated to the reserve, but not without seeing some initial action. The Sankt Georg did, however, participate in the battles for the Straits of Otranto in the latter stages of the war."
AUS_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Franz Ferdinand"
AUS_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "With capital ships becoming larger and less affordable to many nations a trend emerged of reviving the armoured cruiser style as a small capital ship able to destroy enemy cruisers and deter larger capital ships. The cash-strapped Austro-Hungarian Navy eagerly joined the trend, calling them Panzerschiffe. They were used as a stop-gap measure to bolster the main battle fleet and provide a strong ship for coastal defense duties. The resulting Franz Ferdinand-class was armed with ten 24cm guns in twin and triple turrets. While a fairly modest calibre for a ship of its type, the designers hoped that bolstering the number of guns aboard would prove deadly."
AUS_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Triest"
AUS_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Triest class was more similar to the design of the other ships of its type around the world, armed with two triple 30.5cm turrets. While overall similar to the SMS Franz Ferdinand, it did have improved armour, fire-control, and anti-aircraft armament."
AUS_heavy_cruiser_5:0 "Dubrovnik"
AUS_heavy_cruiser_5_desc:0 "With an extra triple turret, bringing the number of 30.5 cm guns to nine, the Dubrovnik-class saw additional improvement in firepower and anti-aircraft capabilities. Otherwise, the SMS Dubrovnik saw further additions to anti-aircraft and dual-purpose armament over the preceding designs."
AUS_heavy_cruiser_6:0 "Praha"
AUS_heavy_cruiser_6_desc:0 "The gun arrangement on the Praha-class was significantly different than its predecessors, and closer to the traditional layout of Austro-Hungarian capital ships since the dreadnought era: ten 30.5cm guns in triple and double turrets, nearly identical to the Tegetthoff class. The irony of a Panzerschiff essentially being a modernised dreadnought was not lost on many observers, and the Praha gained the nickname of Kleintegetthoff 'Little Tegetthoff'."

The German response, the Nassau class (Nassau, Rheinland, Posen, and Westfalen), were begun in 1907 and completed in 1910. Somewhat lighter and slower than their British counterparts, they carried smaller but more numerous guns, and their designers believed that 'weight of fire' would be more significant than range and individual shell effect (a belief they were disillusioned of after the First Battle of Jutland. They carried six twin 28cm turrets. Their immediate successors, the Helgoland class (Helgoland, Ostfriesland, and Thüringen, constructed 1908-11, and Oldenburg, 1909-12), carried slightly heavier armament, with six twin 30.5cm turrets, while the following Kaiser class (Kaiser 1909-12, Friedrich der Grosse 1910-12, Kaiserin 1910-13, Prinzregent Luitpold 1910-13, and König Albert 1910-13) carried five twin 30.5cm turrets. All ships of these classes were present at both battles of Jutland, except for the König Albert, which missed the First Battle of Jutland, and all thirteen survived the war."

The cash-strapped Austro-Hungarian Navy eagerly joined the trend, calling them Panzerschiffe. They were used as a stop-gap measure to bolster the main battle fleet and provide a strong ship for coastal defense duties. The resulting Franz Ferdinand-class was armed with ten 24cm guns in twin and triple turrets. While a fairly modest calibre for a ship of its type, the designers hoped that bolstering the number of guns aboard would prove deadly."
BOS_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Triest"
BOS_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Triest class was more similar to the design of the other ships of its type around the world, armed with two triple 30.5cm turrets. While overall similar to the SMS Franz Ferdinand, it did have improved armour, fire-control, and anti-aircraft armament."

BOS_heavy_cruiser_5_desc:0 "With an extra triple turret, bringing the number of 30.5 cm guns to nine, the Dubrovnik-class saw additional improvement in firepower and anti-aircraft capabilities. Otherwise, the SMS Dubrovnik saw further additions to anti-aircraft and dual-purpose armament over the preceding designs."
BOS_heavy_cruiser_6:0 "Praha"
BOS_heavy_cruiser_6_desc:0 "The gun arrangement on the Praha-class was significantly different than its predecessors, and closer to the traditional layout of Austro-Hungarian capital ships since the dreadnought era: ten 30.5cm guns in triple and double turrets, nearly identical to the Tegetthoff class. The irony of a Panzerschiff essentially being a modernised dreadnought was not lost on many observers, and the Praha gained the nickname of Kleintegetthoff 'Little Tegetthoff'."

CAF_battleship_1_desc:0 "Created by the British, battlecruisers were designed to be a merger of armoured cruiser and battleship, with the speed of the former and firepower of the latter. These first battlecruisers, of the Invincible, Indefatigable, Lion, Queen Mary, and Tiger classes, had particularly light armour, with armament increasing from four twin 12 inch turrets to four twin 13.5 inch turrets as the designs progressed. In total, ten of these ships were built from 1906 to 1914. The battles of Jutland would be cruel to these classes; the Invincible, Indefatigable, and Queen Mary were lost at the First Battle of Jutland, while the Australia, Lion, Princess Royal, and Tiger were sunk at the Second Battle of Jutland."

In terms of firepower and armour, they would be superior to previous British battlecruisers, and carry three twin 15 inch turrets. Both ships of the class, the Renown and Repulse, were completed in 1916, too late in the year to fight in the First Battle of Jutland. They both fought at the Second Battle of Jutland, where their armour was shown to be inadequate and they were sunk to the bottom of the ocean."

Work on these ships was begun in 1916, and hastened to a nearly frantic level in 1917, after word was received of German work on their battlecruisers recommencing. As a result, all four ships, the Hood, Anson, Howe, and Rodney, were completed in early-mid 1919 and present at the Second Battle of Jutland; their weak armour led to poor survivability, with both the Anson and the Rodney sunk in combat."

With the battlecruiser force especially mauled, new ships were a top priority. Sharing many characteristics with the new dreadnoughts, the Nelson class had prioritised armour protection of key systems; the ships were heavily armoured for a battlecruiser and carried heavier weapons than their predecessors, with three triple 16 inch turrets. Construction of four ships began in 1919: Nelson, Fisher, Dundonald and Cornwallis. The three ships that remained with the Republicans after the Revolution were renamed as the Marx, Odger, and Quaker.\nAs the Dreadnought Race reached its peak, the British continued efforts to rebuild their battlecruiser forces. An improved Nelson design, the Rodney class were intended to return that force to strength. Just four ships had been completed by 1924, the other four, begun in 1922 and 1923, were not yet completed when the Revolution erupted. One that was mostly finished was seized and taken to Canada, while another was damaged in conflict between dock workers and Royalists."

New dreadnoughts, halted since the completion of the Revenge class in 1916, suddenly became top priority. The result was the Magnificent class. They had a radical new design, increasing the armour of key ship areas, with the turrets and a tower bridge located forward of the machinery spaces. Due to this, these ships were significantly better protected than other contemporary designs. Increased firepower was also important and ships were armed with three triple 18 inch turrets.\nFour ships were ordered; the Magnificent and Majestic were begun in 1920 and completed in 1924, while the Illustrious and Victorious were begun in 1921 and completed in 1925. The Magnificent, Majestic, and Victorious would side with the Royalists in the Revolution, fleeing to Canada in its wake, while the Illustrious would remain loyal to Britain, and be renamed the Naseby after the Syndicalists took power."

Their final effort towards that end was the Victoria class: based on an enlarged Magnificent class design, with additional engines and four triple 18 inch turrets. Immensely expensive, these ships required alterations to the shipyards before work could even begin, delaying their construction. Two were begun in 1923, and two more in 1924, but the British economy was coming apart, and resources were prioritized towards finishing Magnificent and Rodney class ships. As a result when the Revolution exploded, only one of these ships was close to completion; finally finished in 1929, she was renamed from the Victoria to the Owens by the Republican Navy. The other somewhat serviceable hull under construction was, in the wake of the Revolution, to have a much different fate, becoming the basis for the super-carrier Rebecca. The final two hulls, far from completion, were scrapped."

Completed in 1918, the Argus was finished in time to provide limited air coverage at the Second Battle of Jutland, and then proceeded to serve as the main experimental platform for the early development of British naval aviation. The Revolution would be bloody for her: her crew fought bitterly amongst themselves, with many killed, before Royalist support arrived from nearby ships and decided the outcome. Taken away to Canada it would be several years before the government there could afford to fully repair the damage she suffered during that initial crew combat. Finally repaired in the late 1920s, she was then dispatched to provide the Canadian Pacific fleet with aerial reconnaissance capabilities and fighter protection. The Argus normally carried 15-18 aircraft."

The Royalists, not led by carrier enthusiasts like the Republicans, were nonetheless not entirely blind to the potential of naval aviation, and so devoted efforts to maintaining the Hermes and continuing the development of other carriers.

Lack of funds, and American antipathy to initial contact doomed the plan, but the Canadians were, through means of espionage and commercial dealings, able to obtain partial information about the conversion designs, which would greatly influence the development of Entente heavy carriers in the future."

Both battles of Jutland had significant design impacts, with the most notable being increased priority being given to armour.

Completed in 1918, the Argus was finished in time to provide limited air coverage at the Second Battle of Jutland, and then proceeded to serve as the main experimental platform for the early development of British naval aviation. The Revolution would be bloody for her: her crew fought bitterly amongst themselves, with many killed, before Royalist support arrived from nearby ships and decided the outcome. Taken away to Canada it would be several years before the government there could afford to fully repair the damage she suffered during that initial crew combat. Finally repaired in the late 1920s, she was then dispatched to provide the Canadian Pacific fleet with aerial reconnaissance capabilities and fighter protection. The Argus normally carried 15-18 aircraft."
CAN_carrier_3:0 "Hermes"
CAN_carrier_3_desc:0 "The first ship ever designed from the keel up as a carrier, the Hermes was begun in 1918, and completed in 1924. In port when the Revolution began she was seized by Royalists and subsequently taken, along with the rest of the exiled fleet, to Canada. The Royalists, not led by carrier enthusiasts like the Republicans, were nonetheless not entirely blind to the potential of naval aviation, and so devoted efforts to maintaining the Hermes and continuing the development of other carriers. The Hermes normally carried roughly 20 aircraft."

CAN_heavy_carrier_1:0 "커리지"
CAN_heavy_carrier_1_desc:0 "After the United States cancelled the Yorktown class, and began to convert the Yorktown herself into a large aircraft carrier, the high levels of the Canadian Royal Navy began to discuss the possibility of purchasing the incomplete hull of her sister ship, the Essex, and paying for her her to be finished to the same carrier design. Lack of funds, and American antipathy to initial contact doomed the plan, but the Canadians were, through means of espionage and commercial dealings, able to obtain partial information about the conversion designs, which would greatly influence the development of Entente heavy carriers in the future."

The Capitán Prat was the first electrical-system equipped battleship in the world, and carried four single 9.4 inch turrets as her primary armament. The United States attempted to purchase her in 1898, before the Spanish-American war, and Japan tried to do likewise in 1903, as Russo-Japanese tension escalated; both offers were unsuccessful, and she remained in Chilean service. While badly obsolete by the 1930s, she continued to serve a valuable training role, and was still technically in-service and ready to be called upon to defend her homeland."

Its ten 41cm guns were set in two triple turrets and two twin superfiring turrets on the centreline, similar to the Schwarzenberg-class. It also had a total of twenty 12cm guns in ten twin turrets, along with the now-traditional array of 40mm guns for anti-aircraft duties."

Displacing 400 tons, they were armed with a 66 mm gun, seven 47 mm guns, and two 45 cm torpedo tubes. They served with distinction during the war, when three of the 14 in were sunk. Most survivors were later retired and scrapped in the interwar period. The Tátra class were similar; enlarged Huszárs with better speed and firepower."
CRO_destroyer_2:0 "에르사츠 트리글라브"
CRO_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Ersatz Triglav class were built in 1917 to replace wartime losses. Compared to the Tátra, they had less secondary guns to make place for a second twin torpedo launcher and an anti-aircraft machine gun."

CRO_destroyer_3_desc:0 "With three twin torpedo launchers and four 10 cm guns, the Turul-class was conceived as an even heavier design than the Ersatz Triglav, at 1200 tonnes. With a top speed of 35 knots, it was still one of the fastest type of ships at the time of its commissioning."
CRO_destroyer_4:0 "에르사츠 후자르"
CRO_destroyer_4_desc:0 "Meant to replace the aging Huszár destroyers still in service, the Ersatz Huszár was a modern design, and the first Austro-Hungarian destroyer class using twin-gun turrets.

CRO_destroyer_5:0 "빌트슈피체"
CRO_destroyer_5_desc:0 "Part of the 1937 Naval rearmament program, made possible thanks to renewed Hungarian funding, the Wildspitze-class were 2000-ton destroyers meant to support a true Mediterranean fleet.

CRO_destroyer_6:0 "바스카푸"
CRO_destroyer_6_desc:0 "A slightly-enlarged and heavier Wildspitze, the Vaskapu-class were 2500-ton ships with an extra superfiting aft twin 12cm turret. Torpedo mounts were upgraded from triple to quadruple launchers. Its anti-aircraft machine guns were replaced with fewer, but more effective autocannons. Otherwise, it retained similar maneuverability and speed compared to its predecessor, despite the added displacement."
CRO_destroyer_7:0 "그렌저"
CRO_destroyer_7_desc:0 "This 3000-ton design retained the same armaments as the Vaskapu, but had improved engines for far better speed and greater range, allowing for longer operations. General improvements to AA, ASW, electronics, and fire control supported the upgrade."

CRO_light_cruiser_1:0 "Admiral Spaun"
CRO_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The SMS Admiral Spaun was a Rapidkreuzer, or fast cruiser, designed for scouting purposes, as new realities required the navy to expand beyond coastal defense. It was notable for being the first Austro-Hungarian ship built with steam turbines. As expected for an early light cruiser, it was poorly armoured, and lightly armed, with seven 10 cm guns, a 7cm AA gun, and a 47mm gun. Its torpedo armament was initially limited to two 45cm launchers, but was upgraded during the war to four twin launchers. During the Weltkrieg it saw service as a flotilla leader despite its obsolescence."
CRO_light_cruiser_2:0 "Helgoland"
CRO_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Sometimes known as the Novara-class, the Helgoland-class was a slightly-upgraded Admiral Spaun with heavier armament, designed with Montecuccolo's idea that the Austro-Hungarian Navy would be required to operate outside of the Adriatic in mind. While the SMS Admiral Spaun was a single ship, there were three ships of the Helgoland class: Saida, Helgoland, and Novara, making it the first actual class for modern light cruisers in the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine."
CRO_light_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Njevgovan"
CRO_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Known as the Ersatz Zenta, the Admiral Njevgovan-class was meant to replace the obsolete protected cruisers of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The war delayed their construction, and they would only be built during its final stages. Their armament consisted of two 19cm guns and six 15cm guns, along with two torpedo tubes and four 9 cm guns. They displaced well over 8500 tons, making it a fairly heavy design, consistent with post-war cruiser designs."
CRO_light_cruiser_4:0 "Custozza"
CRO_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Custozza class of cruisers were built by Austria-Hungaery to control the post war Mediterranean Sea, seeing the need for a cruiser capable of long operations and able to fight the new generation of cruisers. It had three twin 19 cm turrets, one fore and two aft, and a pair of torpedo tubes on each side of the ship, along with four 9 cm AA guns. Despite its buky 9500 tons it could still reach a top speed of 32 knots."
CRO_light_cruiser_5:0 "Höchstädt"
CRO_light_cruiser_5_desc:0 "The Höchstädt class was little more than an enlarged Custozza, taking into account the lessons from its predecessors, primarily seeing the addition of a fourth (fore) turret and two additional pair of torpedo tubes for additional firepower. Its anti-aircraft armament was upgraded to 10 cm high-angle guns."
CRO_light_cruiser_6:0 "Karfreit"
CRO_light_cruiser_6_desc:0 "The Karfreit class saw its primary armament slightly upgraded to modern 20 cm guns. Its anti-aircraft complement was further upgraded from its predecessor: four twin 10cm in high-angle turrets with improved fire-control systems, along with an array of 20mm autocannons. The torpedo launchers were also upgraded to triple launchers using 55cm torpedoes."
CRO_light_cruiser_7:0 "Otranto"
CRO_light_cruiser_7_desc:0 "The Otranto class was a significant advancement over its predecessors, using autoloading systems designed by Škoda for its primary and secondary armament, greatly improving the rate of fire of its guns. Most of the 20mm autocannons were replaced by 4 mm autocannons."

CRO_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Kaiser Karl VI"
CRO_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The SMS Kaiser Karl VI was the second armoured cruiser built by Austria-Hungary. She displaced over 6000 tons and was armed with two 24cm guns, eight 15cm guns, a wide array of tertiary guns of different calibres, and two torpedo tubes. During the Weltkrieg, the ship was mostly inactive as part of the fleet-in-being plan, as the ship was too slow to operate with the other more modern cruisers in the fleet."
CRO_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Sankt Georg"
CRO_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The SMS Sankt Georg was the third, and final, armoured cruiser in the Austro-Hungarian Kriegsmarine. Her design was slightly heavier and had stronger secondary armament and belt armour. Like her two fellow armoured cruisers she was rendered obsolete fairly quickly and relegated to the reserve, but not without seeing some initial action. The Sankt Georg did, however, participate in the battles for the Straits of Otranto in the latter stages of the war."
CRO_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Franz Ferdinand"
CRO_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "With capital ships becoming larger and less affordable to many nations a trend emerged of reviving the armoured cruiser style as a small capital ship able to destroy enemy cruisers and deter larger capital ships. The cash-strapped Austro-Hungarian Navy eagerly joined the trend, calling them Panzerschiffe. They were used as a stop-gap measure to bolster the main battle fleet and provide a strong ship for coastal defense duties. The resulting Franz Ferdinand-class was armed with ten 24cm guns in twin and triple turrets. While a fairly modest calibre for a ship of its type, the designers hoped that bolstering the number of guns aboard would prove deadly."
CRO_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Triest"
CRO_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Triest class was more similar to the design of the other ships of its type around the world, armed with two triple 30.5cm turrets. While overall similar to the SMS Franz Ferdinand, it did have improved armour, fire-control, and anti-aircraft armament."
CRO_heavy_cruiser_5:0 "Dubrovnik"
CRO_heavy_cruiser_5_desc:0 "With an extra triple turret, bringing the number of 30.5 cm guns to nine, the Dubrovnik-class saw additional improvement in firepower and anti-aircraft capabilities. Otherwise, the SMS Dubrovnik saw further additions to anti-aircraft and dual-purpose armament over the preceding designs."
CRO_heavy_cruiser_6:0 "Praha"
CRO_heavy_cruiser_6_desc:0 "The gun arrangement on the Praha-class was significantly different than its predecessors, and closer to the traditional layout of Austro-Hungarian capital ships since the dreadnought era: ten 30.5cm guns in triple and double turrets, nearly identical to the Tegetthoff class. The irony of a Panzerschiff essentially being a modernised dreadnought was not lost on many observers, and the Praha gained the nickname of Kleintegetthoff 'Little Tegetthoff'."

Construction was repeatedly delayed, and the design underwent a series of alterations. Both battles of Jutland had significant design impacts, with the most notable being increased priority being given to armour. They were armed with four twin 16 inch turrets.\nDesigned as a continuation of the Lexington class, the Yorktown class were the first American ships classified as 'fast battleships' from construction. Construction began on three in 1923 with another three on order. The economic turmoil after 1925 impacted this class significantly.

CSA_SH_battleship_6:0 "Missouri"
CSA_SH_battleship_6_desc:0 "The US government initially rejected the so-called 'Tillman' designs. However, the major increase in German and British ship construction in 1919 led it to reluctantly order a cut-down 'modest' design built as the Missouri class, armed with four twin 18 inch turrets, with the intent of creating 'ultimate battleships' to protect American isolation ; the navy retained the base hull of the more extreme design for these ships, with the intent to eventually upgun them into four triple 18 inch turrets. The Missouri, Ohio, and Georgia were all laid down in 1920 and completed in 1924; the economic suffering of the late 1920s would ensure that the plans to upgun these ships were scrapped"
CSA_SH_battleship_7:0 "Nebraska"
CSA_SH_battleship_7_desc:0 "News of European ships under construction with 18 inch guns triggered something of a 'naval panic' in the United States, which the navy used as leverage to get the design they originally intended for the Missouri class approved, for their construction had not progressed far. Armed with five triple 18 inch turrets, the newly separated from its 'parent class' Nebraska class would have the heaviest firepower of any ship type when their construction began. The Nebraska was laid down in 1921 and completed in 1925; an additional hull laid down in 1921 was suspended in late 1925, and was eventually scrapped, while three further hulls, begun in 1922, were scrapped in 1927.No more hulls had been begun, with Congress increasingly reticent to fund yet more naval construction after 1922."

Drawing on knowledge from smaller carriers, and from examining ex-British Royalist carriers in US ports for maintenance, the design for the converted Yorktown was, relative to the other conversion carriers of her generation, quite forward-looking and ahead of her time. Completed in 1929, the Yorktown normally carried 75-80 aircraft."

CZE_SH_battleship_6_desc:0 "As the Anglo-German Dreadnought Race intensified the Marinetechnische Komitee began design studies of the new generation of battleships, all based on an upscaled Hunyadi using eight or nine 45cm guns in different arrangements. While several designs were submitted in the first Heavy Battleship Project, Austria-Hungary never built such ships, as they would have been far too expensive for a crippled Empire focused on recovering from the Weltkrieg."
CZE_SH_battleship_7:0 "슈베러 슐라흐트쉬프 II"
CZE_SH_battleship_7_desc:0 "The second set of designs for an Austro-Hungarian Heavy Battleship were based on the SMS Kaiser Wilhelm II. Their armament varied from 10 to 12 45cm guns, with some studies even featuring 48cm guns. Of course these fantasy designs, like their predecessors, were never intended to be built and were simply thought experiments; after all the Empire certainly lacked the resources, money, or docks to build these monstrosities."

CZE_battleship_3:0 "슐라흐트크로이처 프로젝트 이프"
CZE_battleship_3_desc:0 "Conceived as a thought experiment during the Weltkrieg, the Schlachtkreuzer projects greatly varied in design. Projekt If, for example, would have carried four twin 35cm guns on the centreline (with two of them superfiring), eighteen 15cm and twelve 9cm guns in casemates, and four 9cm AA guns. In the end, no battlecruisers were ordered at the time, as their use in the Imperial and Royal Navy would have been questionable."
CZE_battleship_4:0 "에르사츠 합스부르크"
CZE_battleship_4_desc:0 "As the Schwerer Schlachtschiff project was abandoned, the Marinetechnische Komitee shifted their focus towards a more balanced design. They settled on an upgraded Hunyadi with the same armament (two triple and two twin 38cm main gun turrets), but significantly faster. However, the order was cancelled in the mid-20s, after the Hungarian parliament refused to finance their share of the naval budget."
CZE_battleship_5:0 "슈바르젠베르크"
CZE_battleship_5_desc:0 "The jewel of the 1937 Naval Plan were the Schwarzenberg class of fast battleships. With ten 38cm guns, 35cm belt armour, and the ability to reach over 30 knots, they were the first Fast Battleships of the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine. Their secondary armament consisted of six twin dual-purpose 12cm turrets, and a number of 40mm and 20mm guns in various twin or quadruple mounts. They were later upgraded with surface radar."
CZE_battleship_6:0 "라우돈"
CZE_battleship_6_desc:0 "An upgraded Schwarzenberg, the Laudon-class carried four twin 41cm turrets and had two more 12cm turrets over its predecessors. They also had improved electronics and fire-control systems."
CZE_battleship_7:0 "라데츠키"
CZE_battleship_7_desc:0 "The Radetzky class, not to be confused with the pre-Weltkrieg semi-dreadnoughts of the same name, was the ultimate fast battleship design of the k.u.k. Navy. Its ten 41cm guns were set in two triple turrets and two twin superfiring turrets on the centreline, similar to the Schwarzenberg-class. It also had a total of twenty 12cm guns in ten twin turrets, along with the now-traditional array of 40mm guns for anti-aircraft duties."

CZE_destroyer_1:0 "후자르 / 타트라"
CZE_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Huszár class was the first series of modern destroyers built for the Austro-Hungarian Navy. Displacing 400 tons, they were armed with a 66 mm gun, seven 47 mm guns, and two 45 cm torpedo tubes. They served with distinction during the war, when three of the 14 in were sunk. Most survivors were later retired and scrapped in the interwar period. The Tátra class were similar; enlarged Huszárs with better speed and firepower."
CZE_destroyer_2:0 "에르사츠 트리글라브"
CZE_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Ersatz Triglav class were built in 1917 to replace wartime losses. Compared to the Tátra, they had less secondary guns to make place for a second twin torpedo launcher and an anti-aircraft machine gun."
CZE_destroyer_3:0 "투룰"
CZE_destroyer_3_desc:0 "With three twin torpedo launchers and four 10 cm guns, the Turul-class was conceived as an even heavier design than the Ersatz Triglav, at 1200 tonnes. With a top speed of 35 knots, it was still one of the fastest type of ships at the time of its commissioning."
CZE_destroyer_4:0 "에르사츠 후자르"
CZE_destroyer_4_desc:0 "Meant to replace the aging Huszár destroyers still in service, the Ersatz Huszár was a modern design, and the first Austro-Hungarian destroyer class using twin-gun turrets. Displacing around 1700 tons, it carried two twin 12 cm guns and three triple 45 cm torpedo launchers."
CZE_destroyer_5:0 "빌트슈피체"
CZE_destroyer_5_desc:0 "Part of the 1937 Naval rearmament program, made possible thanks to renewed Hungarian funding, the Wildspitze-class were 2000-ton destroyers meant to support a true Mediterranean fleet. They were armed with two twin dual purpose 12cm turrets and two triple 55cm torpedo launchers, along with a modest array of anti-aircraft machine guns."
CZE_destroyer_6:0 "바스카푸"
CZE_destroyer_6_desc:0 "A slightly-enlarged and heavier Wildspitze, the Vaskapu-class were 2500-ton ships with an extra superfiting aft twin 12cm turret. Torpedo mounts were upgraded from triple to quadruple launchers. Its anti-aircraft machine guns were replaced with fewer, but more effective autocannons. Otherwise, it retained similar maneuverability and speed compared to its predecessor, despite the added displacement."
CZE_destroyer_7:0 "그렌저"
CZE_destroyer_7_desc:0 "This 3000-ton design retained the same armaments as the Vaskapu, but had improved engines for far better speed and greater range, allowing for longer operations. General improvements to AA, ASW, electronics, and fire control supported the upgrade."

CZE_light_cruiser_1:0 "Admiral Spaun"
CZE_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The SMS Admiral Spaun was a Rapidkreuzer, or fast cruiser, designed for scouting purposes, as new realities required the navy to expand beyond coastal defense. It was notable for being the first Austro-Hungarian ship built with steam turbines. As expected for an early light cruiser, it was poorly armoured, and lightly armed, with seven 10 cm guns, a 7cm AA gun, and a 47mm gun. Its torpedo armament was initially limited to two 45cm launchers, but was upgraded during the war to four twin launchers. During the Weltkrieg it saw service as a flotilla leader despite its obsolescence."
CZE_light_cruiser_2:0 "Helgoland"
CZE_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Sometimes known as the Novara-class, the Helgoland-class was a slightly-upgraded Admiral Spaun with heavier armament, designed with Montecuccolo's idea that the Austro-Hungarian Navy would be required to operate outside of the Adriatic in mind. While the SMS Admiral Spaun was a single ship, there were three ships of the Helgoland class: Saida, Helgoland, and Novara, making it the first actual class for modern light cruisers in the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine."
CZE_light_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Njevgovan"
CZE_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Known as the Ersatz Zenta, the Admiral Njevgovan-class was meant to replace the obsolete protected cruisers of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The war delayed their construction, and they would only be built during its final stages. Their armament consisted of two 19cm guns and six 15cm guns, along with two torpedo tubes and four 9 cm guns. They displaced well over 8500 tons, making it a fairly heavy design, consistent with post-war cruiser designs."
CZE_light_cruiser_4:0 "Custozza"
CZE_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Custozza class of cruisers were built by Austria-Hungaery to control the post war Mediterranean Sea, seeing the need for a cruiser capable of long operations and able to fight the new generation of cruisers. It had three twin 19 cm turrets, one fore and two aft, and a pair of torpedo tubes on each side of the ship, along with four 9 cm AA guns. Despite its buky 9500 tons it could still reach a top speed of 32 knots."
CZE_light_cruiser_5:0 "Höchstädt"
CZE_light_cruiser_5_desc:0 "The Höchstädt class was little more than an enlarged Custozza, taking into account the lessons from its predecessors, primarily seeing the addition of a fourth (fore) turret and two additional pair of torpedo tubes for additional firepower. Its anti-aircraft armament was upgraded to 10 cm high-angle guns."
CZE_light_cruiser_6:0 "Karfreit"
CZE_light_cruiser_6_desc:0 "The Karfreit class saw its primary armament slightly upgraded to modern 20 cm guns. Its anti-aircraft complement was further upgraded from its predecessor: four twin 10cm in high-angle turrets with improved fire-control systems, along with an array of 20mm autocannons. The torpedo launchers were also upgraded to triple launchers using 55cm torpedoes."
CZE_light_cruiser_7:0 "Otranto"
CZE_light_cruiser_7_desc:0 "The Otranto class was a significant advancement over its predecessors, using autoloading systems designed by Škoda for its primary and secondary armament, greatly improving the rate of fire of its guns. Most of the 20mm autocannons were replaced by 4 mm autocannons."

CZE_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Kaiser Karl VI"
CZE_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The SMS Kaiser Karl VI was the second armoured cruiser built by Austria-Hungary. She displaced over 6000 tons and was armed with two 24cm guns, eight 15cm guns, a wide array of tertiary guns of different calibres, and two torpedo tubes. During the Weltkrieg, the ship was mostly inactive as part of the fleet-in-being plan, as the ship was too slow to operate with the other more modern cruisers in the fleet."
CZE_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Sankt Georg"
CZE_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The SMS Sankt Georg was the third, and final, armoured cruiser in the Austro-Hungarian Kriegsmarine. Her design was slightly heavier and had stronger secondary armament and belt armour. Like her two fellow armoured cruisers she was rendered obsolete fairly quickly and relegated to the reserve, but not without seeing some initial action. The Sankt Georg did, however, participate in the battles for the Straits of Otranto in the latter stages of the war."
CZE_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Franz Ferdinand"
CZE_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "With capital ships becoming larger and less affordable to many nations a trend emerged of reviving the armoured cruiser style as a small capital ship able to destroy enemy cruisers and deter larger capital ships. The cash-strapped Austro-Hungarian Navy eagerly joined the trend, calling them Panzerschiffe. They were used as a stop-gap measure to bolster the main battle fleet and provide a strong ship for coastal defense duties. The resulting Franz Ferdinand-class was armed with ten 24cm guns in twin and triple turrets. While a fairly modest calibre for a ship of its type, the designers hoped that bolstering the number of guns aboard would prove deadly."
CZE_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Triest"
CZE_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Triest class was more similar to the design of the other ships of its type around the world, armed with two triple 30.5cm turrets. While overall similar to the SMS Franz Ferdinand, it did have improved armour, fire-control, and anti-aircraft armament."
CZE_heavy_cruiser_5:0 "Dubrovnik"
CZE_heavy_cruiser_5_desc:0 "With an extra triple turret, bringing the number of 30.5 cm guns to nine, the Dubrovnik-class saw additional improvement in firepower and anti-aircraft capabilities. Otherwise, the SMS Dubrovnik saw further additions to anti-aircraft and dual-purpose armament over the preceding designs."
CZE_heavy_cruiser_6:0 "Praha"
CZE_heavy_cruiser_6_desc:0 "The gun arrangement on the Praha-class was significantly different than its predecessors, and closer to the traditional layout of Austro-Hungarian capital ships since the dreadnought era: ten 30.5cm guns in triple and double turrets, nearly identical to the Tegetthoff class. The irony of a Panzerschiff essentially being a modernised dreadnought was not lost on many observers, and the Praha gained the nickname of Kleintegetthoff 'Little Tegetthoff'."

DEH_battleship_1_desc:0 "Created by the British, battlecruisers were designed to be a merger of armoured cruiser and battleship, with the speed of the former and firepower of the latter. These first battlecruisers, of the Invincible, Indefatigable, Lion, Queen Mary, and Tiger classes, had particularly light armour, with armament increasing from four twin 12 inch turrets to four twin 13.5 inch turrets as the designs progressed. In total, ten of these ships were built from 1906 to 1914. The battles of Jutland would be cruel to these classes; the Invincible, Indefatigable, and Queen Mary were lost at the First Battle of Jutland, while the Australia, Lion, Princess Royal, and Tiger were sunk at the Second Battle of Jutland."
DEH_battleship_2:0 "리나운"
DEH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Renown class of battlecruisers began as design modifications of the Revenge class battleships, and were altered in the planning stage to have increased speed and reduced armour. In terms of firepower and armour, they would be superior to previous British battlecruisers, and carry three twin 15 inch turrets. Both ships of the class, the Renown and Repulse, were completed in 1916, too late in the year to fight in the First Battle of Jutland. They both fought at the Second Battle of Jutland, where their armour was shown to be inadequate and they were sunk to the bottom of the ocean."
DEH_battleship_3:0 "애드머럴"
DEH_battleship_3_desc:0 "Based on the Queen Elizabeth class of dreadnoughts, but with significantly increased speed and lighter armour, the Admiral class of battlecruisers saw several design changes in the wake of the First Battle of Jutland. Work on these ships was begun in 1916, and hastened to a nearly frantic level in 1917, after word was received of German work on their battlecruisers recommencing. As a result, all four ships, the Hood, Anson, Howe, and Rodney, were completed in early-mid 1919 and present at the Second Battle of Jutland; their weak armour led to poor survivability, with both the Anson and the Rodney sunk in combat."
DEH_battleship_4:0 "넬슨"
DEH_battleship_4_desc:0 "In the wake of the Second Battle of Jutland, the British scrambled to replace lost ships and recover total naval superiority. With the battlecruiser force especially mauled, new ships were a top priority. Sharing many characteristics with the new dreadnoughts, the Nelson class had prioritised armour protection of key systems; the ships were heavily armoured for a battlecruiser and carried heavier weapons than their predecessors, with three triple 16 inch turrets. Construction of four ships began in 1919: Nelson, Fisher, Dundonald and Cornwallis. The three ships that remained with the Republicans after the Revolution were renamed as the Marx, Odger, and Quaker.\nAs the Dreadnought Race reached its peak, the British continued efforts to rebuild their battlecruiser forces. An improved Nelson design, the Rodney class were intended to return that force to strength. Just four ships had been completed by 1924, the other four, begun in 1922 and 1923, were not yet completed when the Revolution erupted. One that was mostly finished was seized and taken to Canada, while another was damaged in conflict between dock workers and Royalists."

She was followed in Britain by the Bellerophon class, the St Vincent class (St Vincent, Collingwood, and Vanguard), the Neptune and the Colossus class (Colossus and Hercules). \nThe Vanguard, suffered a magazine explosion in 1917, and was destroyed. During the Revolution, the Hercules, controlled by Revolutionary forces, and actively attacking and sinking non-military ships carrying 'traitors' (mostly families) fleeing the Revolution, was engaged by the Royalist Temeraire and Malaya; while the Hercules was accompanied by St Vincent and Colossus, she was still sunk, and escorts damaged.

They were armed with five twin 13.5 inch turrets.\nA King George V class dreadnought, the Audacious, struck a mine and sank in 1914, while the Monarch, an Orion, was destroyed by German battlecruiser strikes at the Second Battle of Jutland; the other ships all managed to survive the Weltkrieg. During the Revolution, the King George V was called upon by Royalist forces to bombard pro-Revolutionary “mobs”/crowds in London; after sailing up the Thames to do so, she was chased down by the Revolutionary-controlled Queen Elizabeth, and was sunk in the ensuing battle.

New dreadnoughts, halted since the completion of the Revenge class in 1916, suddenly became top priority. The result was the Magnificent class. They had a radical new design, increasing the armour of key ship areas, with the turrets and a tower bridge located forward of the machinery spaces. Due to this, these ships were significantly better protected than other contemporary designs. Increased firepower was also important and ships were armed with three triple 18 inch turrets.\nFour ships were ordered; the Magnificent and Majestic were begun in 1920 and completed in 1924, while the Illustrious and Victorious were begun in 1921 and completed in 1925. The Magnificent, Majestic, and Victorious would side with the Royalists in the Revolution, fleeing to Canada in its wake, while the Illustrious would remain loyal to Britain, and be renamed the Naseby after the Syndicalists took power."

Their final effort towards that end was the Victoria class: based on an enlarged Magnificent class design, with additional engines and four triple 18 inch turrets. Immensely expensive, these ships required alterations to the shipyards before work could even begin, delaying their construction. Two were begun in 1923, and two more in 1924, but the British economy was coming apart, and resources were prioritized towards finishing Magnificent and Rodney class ships. As a result when the Revolution exploded, only one of these ships was close to completion; finally finished in 1929, she was renamed from the Victoria to the Owens by the Republican Navy. The other somewhat serviceable hull under construction was, in the wake of the Revolution, to have a much different fate, becoming the basis for the super-carrier Rebecca. The final two hulls, far from completion, were scrapped."

Completed in 1918, the Argus was finished in time to provide limited air coverage at the Second Battle of Jutland, and then proceeded to serve as the main experimental platform for the early development of British naval aviation. The Revolution would be bloody for her: her crew fought bitterly amongst themselves, with many killed, before Royalist support arrived from nearby ships and decided the outcome. Taken away to Canada it would be several years before the government there could afford to fully repair the damage she suffered during that initial crew combat. Finally repaired in the late 1920s, she was then dispatched to provide the Canadian Pacific fleet with aerial reconnaissance capabilities and fighter protection. The Argus normally carried 15-18 aircraft."

The Royalists, not led by carrier enthusiasts like the Republicans, were nonetheless not entirely blind to the potential of naval aviation, and so devoted efforts to maintaining the Hermes and continuing the development of other carriers.

Lack of funds, and American antipathy to initial contact doomed the plan, but the Canadians were, through means of espionage and commercial dealings, able to obtain partial information about the conversion designs, which would greatly influence the development of Entente heavy carriers in the future."

DEI_battleship_4_desc:0 "Threatened by the growth of the IJN, the Koninklijke Marine requested the construction of modern battleships to defend the East Indies. With tensions high and the international situation precarious, funding was approved for 3 initial ships, with prospects for six more. German firms were asked to provide technical assistance, and the resulting Aemalia class were close to the cutting edge when laid down: fast battleships armed with three triple 380mm turrets and aggressive hull design.\n Construction began in 1924, but building the ships proved considerably harder than anticipated, and they quickly fell behind schedule and over budget, leading to anti-Dutch sentiment in the East Indies, which had to pay the lion's share. The Aemalia was not finished until 1929, while the Groote Liefde followed in 1930 and the Sint Matheuus was not done until 1931. Still, even with their delayed construction, they were formidable ships, and became the core of the colonial fleet."
DEI_battleship_5:0 "Willem van Oranje"
DEI_battleship_5_desc:0 "Intended to be additional ships of the Aemalia class, work on the next three Dutch capital ships was significantly delayed and in the interim years, the advancement of capital ship design resulted in alterations to them. The resulting Willem van Oranje class had increased firepower, with three triple 406mm turrets, and even more aggressive hull form than the preceding ships. While the Koninklijke Marine requested six of these ships in the late 1920s, to be built in two groups of three, budgetary realities intruded; indeed, there were many voices that called for the ships to all be cancelled as the Dreadnought Race was over. The continued weakness of the Dutch versus the IJN, as well as promises of cost reductions from Blohm & Voss intent on securing work after the reduction of German naval construction, led the government to approve half of the requested ships. As preparations got under way the plan was further reduced, and only two of these ships were ordered. Construction began in 1931, and both the Willem van Oranje and her sister Mercurius were delivered in late 1935."

A Royal Commission determined that Japan represented a serious threat, and called for the acquisition of nine dreadnoughts to improve Dutch defensive capabilities. After considerable debate, design proposals were solicited from the German firms of Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft and Blohm & Voss, and the British Vickers; the bill to authorize ordering four battleships was under consideration in Parliament when the outbreak of the Weltkrieg derailed any foreign warship purchases. \nThe massive naval expansions during the war made the Dutch nervous; work was begun to attempt to develop domestic capital ship construction capacity. While several facilities were built, technical expertise and industrial setup to construct such large warships was still lacking when the end of the war reopened the possibility of foreign involvement. The initial ship designs, by then far obsolete, were abandoned, and a new effort, which would eventually produce the Aemalia class began."

The German response, the Nassau class (Nassau, Rheinland, Posen, and Westfalen), were begun in 1907 and completed in 1910. Somewhat lighter and slower than their British counterparts, they carried smaller but more numerous guns, and their designers believed that 'weight of fire' would be more significant than range and individual shell effect (a belief they were disillusioned of after the First Battle of Jutland. They carried six twin 28cm turrets. Their immediate successors, the Helgoland class (Helgoland, Ostfriesland, and Thüringen, constructed 1908-11, and Oldenburg, 1909-12), carried slightly heavier armament, with six twin 30.5cm turrets, while the following Kaiser class (Kaiser 1909-12, Friedrich der Grosse 1910-12, Kaiserin 1910-13, Prinzregent Luitpold 1910-13, and König Albert 1910-13) carried five twin 30.5cm turrets.

The ship was relegated to secondary roles after Russia's first dreadnought battleship entered service in late 1915.

These first battlecruisers, of the Invincible, Indefatigable, Lion, Queen Mary, and Tiger classes, had particularly light armour, with armament increasing from four twin 12 inch turrets to four twin 13.5 inch turrets as the designs progressed. In total, ten of these ships were built from 1906 to 1914. The battles of Jutland would be cruel to these classes; the Invincible, Indefatigable, and Queen Mary were lost at the First Battle of Jutland, while the Australia, Lion, Princess Royal, and Tiger were sunk at the Second Battle of Jutland."
ENG_battleship_2:0 "리나운"
ENG_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Renown class of battlecruisers began as design modifications of the Revenge class battleships, and were altered in the planning stage to have increased speed and reduced armour. In terms of firepower and armour, they would be superior to previous British battlecruisers, and carry three twin 15 inch turrets. Both ships of the class, the Renown and Repulse, were completed in 1916, too late in the year to fight in the First Battle of Jutland. They both fought at the Second Battle of Jutland, where their armour was shown to be inadequate and they were sunk to the bottom of the ocean."

ENG_battleship_3_desc:0 "Based on the Queen Elizabeth class of dreadnoughts, but with significantly increased speed and lighter armour, the Admiral class of battlecruisers saw several design changes in the wake of the First Battle of Jutland. Work on these ships was begun in 1916, and hastened to a nearly frantic level in 1917, after word was received of German work on their battlecruisers recommencing. As a result, all four ships, the Hood, Anson, Howe, and Rodney, were completed in early-mid 1919 and present at the Second Battle of Jutland; their weak armour led to poor survivability, with both the Anson and the Rodney sunk in combat."
ENG_battleship_4:0 "넬슨"
ENG_battleship_4_desc:0 "In the wake of the Second Battle of Jutland, the British scrambled to replace lost ships and recover total naval superiority. With the battlecruiser force especially mauled, new ships were a top priority. Sharing many characteristics with the new dreadnoughts, the Nelson class had prioritised armour protection of key systems; the ships were heavily armoured for a battlecruiser and carried heavier weapons than their predecessors, with three triple 16 inch turrets. Construction of four ships began in 1919: Nelson, Fisher, Dundonald and Cornwallis. The three ships that remained with the Republicans after the Revolution were renamed as the Marx, Odger, and Quaker.\nAs the Dreadnought Race reached its peak, the British continued efforts to rebuild their battlecruiser forces. An improved Nelson design, the Rodney class were intended to return that force to strength. Just four ships had been completed by 1924, the other four, begun in 1922 and 1923, were not yet completed when the Revolution erupted. One that was mostly finished was seized and taken to Canada, while another was damaged in conflict between dock workers and Royalists."

The production of these ships was the result of a compromise agreement between the TUC and the military shipbuilder's unions: the TUC pleaded that resources were needed desperately elsewhere, while the shipbuilders demanded work. They reached compromise in 1929: two capital ships would be laid down each year, one carrier, and one fast battleship, the latter to escort and protect the former."

During the Revolution, the Hercules, controlled by Revolutionary forces, and actively attacking and sinking non-military ships carrying 'traitors' (mostly families) fleeing the Revolution, was engaged by the Royalist Temeraire and Malaya; while the Hercules was accompanied by St Vincent and Colossus, she was still sunk, and escorts damaged.

New dreadnoughts, halted since the completion of the Revenge class in 1916, suddenly became top priority. The result was the Magnificent class. They had a radical new design, increasing the armour of key ship areas, with the turrets and a tower bridge located forward of the machinery spaces. Due to this, these ships were significantly better protected than other contemporary designs. Increased firepower was also important and ships were armed with three triple 18 inch turrets.\nFour ships were ordered; the Magnificent and Majestic were begun in 1920 and completed in 1924, while the Illustrious and Victorious were begun in 1921 and completed in 1925. The Magnificent, Majestic, and Victorious would side with the Royalists in the Revolution, fleeing to Canada in its wake, while the Illustrious would remain loyal to Britain, and be renamed the Naseby after the Syndicalists took power."
ENG_SH_battleship_7:0 "빅토리아"
ENG_SH_battleship_7_desc:0 "Even as the British economy struggled to stay afloat, the Royal Navy continued its desperate efforts to regain and secure naval supremacy. Their final effort towards that end was the Victoria class: based on an enlarged Magnificent class design, with additional engines and four triple 18 inch turrets. Immensely expensive, these ships required alterations to the shipyards before work could even begin, delaying their construction. Two were begun in 1923, and two more in 1924, but the British economy was coming apart, and resources were prioritized towards finishing Magnificent and Rodney class ships. As a result when the Revolution exploded, only one of these ships was close to completion; finally finished in 1929, she was renamed from the Victoria to the Owens by the Republican Navy. The other somewhat serviceable hull under construction was, in the wake of the Revolution, to have a much different fate, becoming the basis for the super-carrier Rebecca. The final two hulls, far from completion, were scrapped."

ENG_heavy_carrier_1:0 "Rebecca"
ENG_heavy_carrier_1_desc:0 "Following the Revolution, the new Union of Britain found itself in possession of several incomplete Victoria class hulls. The first and nearest to completion would be finished as designed, while the next most advanced was selected for completion as an aircraft carrier. Far bigger than any other carrier yet constructed, the ship would be transformed into a massively enlarged version of the then recently completed Furious, the post-conversion design of which was heavily borrowed from in work on the larger ship. Completed in 1927, the Rebecca would become the heart of the Republican carrier force. She would undergo a series of refits and alterations, assuming her final form, with island, twin funnels, and nine twin 6 inch turrets, in 1934. Despite, and in part due to, the years of nearly constant alterations, the Rebecca would permanently suffer from mechanical reliability issues.

ENG_heavy_carrier_2_desc:0 "With the ascendancy of the carrier advocates in the Republican navy, when British shipyards were ready to resume ship construction it was almost a foregone conclusion that new, large, aircraft carriers would be a priority. While some radicals advocated building only carriers and no other large warships, eventually a more moderate plan was put in place of a 'one-for-one' fleet: each carrier to have a battleship to protect it. As the terms of the agreement between the TUC and the shipbuilders' unions set a rate of two capital ships to be built per year, this meant that one carrier was to be laid down per year. \nWhile work began on the Republic in 1929, alterations to her design during construction delayed her completion until 1933, the same year that her first sister ship, the Land and Labour begun in 1930, was finished. A new ship of this class was begun each year from 1931 to 1936. The ships of the Republic class normally carried approximately 60 aircraft."

ENG_carrier_2_desc:0 "The incomplete hull of the would-be Italian ocean liner Conte Rosso was purchased by the British in 1916 intended to be finished as a carrier with a continuous, full-length flight deck. Completed in 1918, the Argus was finished in time to provide limited air coverage at the Second Battle of Jutland, and then proceeded to serve as the main experimental platform for the early development of British naval aviation. The Revolution would be bloody for her: her crew fought bitterly amongst themselves, with many killed, before Royalist support arrived from nearby ships and decided the outcome. Taken away to Canada it would be several years before the government there could afford to fully repair the damage she suffered during that initial crew combat. Finally repaired in the late 1920s, she was then dispatched to provide the Canadian Pacific fleet with aerial reconnaissance capabilities and fighter protection. The Argus normally carried 15-18 aircraft."

ENG_carrier_3_desc:0 "Begun in 1913 the Eagle was initially ordered by Chile to be the battleship Almirante Cochrane; the hull was purchased by Great Britain in 1918, with the intent to complete her as an aircraft carrier. Delayed by design alterations, based on learning from trials aboard the Argus, she was not finished until late 1924, and had not yet finished being crewed and supplied to go to sea when the Revolution began. Quickly seized by Revolutionary forces, she was sent into action to fend off probing attacks by Royalist ships. After the war, she was formally renamed from Eagle to Lilburne, and became the core of the naval aviation force for the new Republican Navy. Soon overshadowed by the Rebecca and other large carriers, she was still very valuable in the early development of Republican naval aviation and remained in active service alongside her bigger cousins. The Lilburne normally carried a complement of 25-30 aircraft."

GAL_destroyer_2:0 "에르사츠 트리글라브"
GAL_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Ersatz Triglav class were built in 1917 to replace wartime losses. Compared to the Tátra, they had less secondary guns to make place for a second twin torpedo launcher and an anti-aircraft machine gun."
GAL_destroyer_3:0 "투룰"
GAL_destroyer_3_desc:0 "With three twin torpedo launchers and four 10 cm guns, the Turul-class was conceived as an even heavier design than the Ersatz Triglav, at 1200 tonnes. With a top speed of 35 knots, it was still one of the fastest type of ships at the time of its commissioning."
GAL_destroyer_4:0 "에르사츠 후자르"
GAL_destroyer_4_desc:0 "Meant to replace the aging Huszár destroyers still in service, the Ersatz Huszár was a modern design, and the first Austro-Hungarian destroyer class using twin-gun turrets. Displacing around 1700 tons, it carried two twin 12 cm guns and three triple 45 cm torpedo launchers."
GAL_destroyer_5:0 "빌트슈피체"
GAL_destroyer_5_desc:0 "Part of the 1937 Naval rearmament program, made possible thanks to renewed Hungarian funding, the Wildspitze-class were 2000-ton destroyers meant to support a true Mediterranean fleet. They were armed with two twin dual purpose 12cm turrets and two triple 55cm torpedo launchers, along with a modest array of anti-aircraft machine guns."
GAL_destroyer_6:0 "바스카푸"
GAL_destroyer_6_desc:0 "A slightly-enlarged and heavier Wildspitze, the Vaskapu-class were 2500-ton ships with an extra superfiting aft twin 12cm turret. Torpedo mounts were upgraded from triple to quadruple launchers. Its anti-aircraft machine guns were replaced with fewer, but more effective autocannons. Otherwise, it retained similar maneuverability and speed compared to its predecessor, despite the added displacement."
GAL_destroyer_7:0 "그렌저"
GAL_destroyer_7_desc:0 "This 3000-ton design retained the same armaments as the Vaskapu, but had improved engines for far better speed and greater range, allowing for longer operations. General improvements to AA, ASW, electronics, and fire control supported the upgrade."

GAL_light_cruiser_1:0 "Admiral Spaun"
GAL_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The SMS Admiral Spaun was a Rapidkreuzer, or fast cruiser, designed for scouting purposes, as new realities required the navy to expand beyond coastal defense. It was notable for being the first Austro-Hungarian ship built with steam turbines. As expected for an early light cruiser, it was poorly armoured, and lightly armed, with seven 10 cm guns, a 7cm AA gun, and a 47mm gun. Its torpedo armament was initially limited to two 45cm launchers, but was upgraded during the war to four twin launchers. During the Weltkrieg it saw service as a flotilla leader despite its obsolescence."
GAL_light_cruiser_2:0 "Helgoland"
GAL_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Sometimes known as the Novara-class, the Helgoland-class was a slightly-upgraded Admiral Spaun with heavier armament, designed with Montecuccolo's idea that the Austro-Hungarian Navy would be required to operate outside of the Adriatic in mind. While the SMS Admiral Spaun was a single ship, there were three ships of the Helgoland class: Saida, Helgoland, and Novara, making it the first actual class for modern light cruisers in the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine."
GAL_light_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Njevgovan"
GAL_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Known as the Ersatz Zenta, the Admiral Njevgovan-class was meant to replace the obsolete protected cruisers of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The war delayed their construction, and they would only be built during its final stages. Their armament consisted of two 19cm guns and six 15cm guns, along with two torpedo tubes and four 9 cm guns. They displaced well over 8500 tons, making it a fairly heavy design, consistent with post-war cruiser designs."
GAL_light_cruiser_4:0 "Custozza"
GAL_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Custozza class of cruisers were built by Austria-Hungaery to control the post war Mediterranean Sea, seeing the need for a cruiser capable of long operations and able to fight the new generation of cruisers. It had three twin 19 cm turrets, one fore and two aft, and a pair of torpedo tubes on each side of the ship, along with four 9 cm AA guns. Despite its buky 9500 tons it could still reach a top speed of 32 knots."
GAL_light_cruiser_5:0 "Höchstädt"
GAL_light_cruiser_5_desc:0 "The Höchstädt class was little more than an enlarged Custozza, taking into account the lessons from its predecessors, primarily seeing the addition of a fourth (fore) turret and two additional pair of torpedo tubes for additional firepower. Its anti-aircraft armament was upgraded to 10 cm high-angle guns."
GAL_light_cruiser_6:0 "Karfreit"
GAL_light_cruiser_6_desc:0 "The Karfreit class saw its primary armament slightly upgraded to modern 20 cm guns. Its anti-aircraft complement was further upgraded from its predecessor: four twin 10cm in high-angle turrets with improved fire-control systems, along with an array of 20mm autocannons. The torpedo launchers were also upgraded to triple launchers using 55cm torpedoes."
GAL_light_cruiser_7:0 "Otranto"
GAL_light_cruiser_7_desc:0 "The Otranto class was a significant advancement over its predecessors, using autoloading systems designed by Škoda for its primary and secondary armament, greatly improving the rate of fire of its guns. Most of the 20mm autocannons were replaced by 4 mm autocannons."

GAL_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Kaiser Karl VI"
GAL_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The SMS Kaiser Karl VI was the second armoured cruiser built by Austria-Hungary. She displaced over 6000 tons and was armed with two 24cm guns, eight 15cm guns, a wide array of tertiary guns of different calibres, and two torpedo tubes. During the Weltkrieg, the ship was mostly inactive as part of the fleet-in-being plan, as the ship was too slow to operate with the other more modern cruisers in the fleet."
GAL_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Sankt Georg"
GAL_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The SMS Sankt Georg was the third, and final, armoured cruiser in the Austro-Hungarian Kriegsmarine. Her design was slightly heavier and had stronger secondary armament and belt armour. Like her two fellow armoured cruisers she was rendered obsolete fairly quickly and relegated to the reserve, but not without seeing some initial action. The Sankt Georg did, however, participate in the battles for the Straits of Otranto in the latter stages of the war."
GAL_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Franz Ferdinand"
GAL_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "With capital ships becoming larger and less affordable to many nations a trend emerged of reviving the armoured cruiser style as a small capital ship able to destroy enemy cruisers and deter larger capital ships. The cash-strapped Austro-Hungarian Navy eagerly joined the trend, calling them Panzerschiffe. They were used as a stop-gap measure to bolster the main battle fleet and provide a strong ship for coastal defense duties. The resulting Franz Ferdinand-class was armed with ten 24cm guns in twin and triple turrets. While a fairly modest calibre for a ship of its type, the designers hoped that bolstering the number of guns aboard would prove deadly."
GAL_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Triest"
GAL_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Triest class was more similar to the design of the other ships of its type around the world, armed with two triple 30.5cm turrets. While overall similar to the SMS Franz Ferdinand, it did have improved armour, fire-control, and anti-aircraft armament."
GAL_heavy_cruiser_5:0 "Dubrovnik"
GAL_heavy_cruiser_5_desc:0 "With an extra triple turret, bringing the number of 30.5 cm guns to nine, the Dubrovnik-class saw additional improvement in firepower and anti-aircraft capabilities. Otherwise, the SMS Dubrovnik saw further additions to anti-aircraft and dual-purpose armament over the preceding designs."
GAL_heavy_cruiser_6:0 "Praha"
GAL_heavy_cruiser_6_desc:0 "The gun arrangement on the Praha-class was significantly different than its predecessors, and closer to the traditional layout of Austro-Hungarian capital ships since the dreadnought era: ten 30.5cm guns in triple and double turrets, nearly identical to the Tegetthoff class. The irony of a Panzerschiff essentially being a modernised dreadnought was not lost on many observers, and the Praha gained the nickname of Kleintegetthoff 'Little Tegetthoff'."

The first German response to these ships was the Von der Tann, completed in 1910, was faster and better protected than the British Invincible class, though somewhat less well armed, with four twin 28cm turrets. She fought at, and survived, both battles of Jutland."
GEA_battleship_2:0 "Moltke"
GEA_battleship_2_desc:0 "While the British were producing their battlecruiser designs in significant numbers, the Germans decided to take a somewhat different path, producing battlecruisers with a greater focus on armour protection but somewhat lighter armament. Six of these ships, the Moltke (Moltke and Goeben), Seydlitz, and Derfflinger (Derfflinger, Lützow, and Hindenburg) classes, were completed during 1911-1917, and would show themselves to be considerably superior to the less well protected British battlecruisers. The Goeben would spend the war trapped in the Mediterranean, as the Ottoman ship Yavuz Sultan Selim, but the rest of the ships would serve in the major naval battles of the war. Lützow was badly damaged at the First Battle of Jutland and scuttled, while the Moltke would be lost at the Second Battle of Jutland, as the German battlecruisers conducted flanking strikes against the main body of British dreadnoughts, but the rest of these ships would survive the war, with the Goeben remaining in Ottoman service after the Weltkrieg. Their armaments were five twin 28cm turrets for the Moltke and Seydlitz classes and four twin 30.5cm turrets for the Derfflinger class."
GEA_battleship_3:0 "Mackensen"
GEA_battleship_3_desc:0 "Based on an improved Derfflinger class design with more powerful engines, increased armour and armament upgraded to four twin 35cm turrets, the Mackensen class were highly potent German battlecruisers. Intended as a class of seven ships, the last three were subsequently altered in design, leaving only the first four as Mackensens. Construction was seriously impeded by the effects of the Weltkrieg, only getting back on track in 1917, following the Kaiser's direct intervention.\nAll four ships participated in the Second Battle of Jutland, where they served with distinction, inflicting serious losses on the British battlecruiser forces present there. The Yorck class, initially intended as additional Mackensens but enlarged and upgunned to four twin 38cm turrets, were not ready in time for the Second Battle of Jutland and have been largely been overshadowed by the ships that preceded and succeeded them. Laid down in 1917, the Yorck, Gneisenau, and Scharnhorst were completed in 1921."
GEA_battleship_4:0 "Prinz Adalbert"
GEA_battleship_4_desc:0 "With the Dreadnought Race over, the German navy found itself in the mid-1920s having to consider its new role, as the guarantor, guardian, and protector of a vast global empire. To secure such a far-flung domain, ships with a balance of speed, armour and firepower as well as extensive range were required, while not being as ruinously expensive as the giants of the preceding trend. German naval architects faced this challenge by re-casting their next generation of battlecruisers into 'fast battleships'. While the Yorck class was retroactively declared to be such, the first of these under the German flag that were designed as such from the start were the Prinz Adalbert class. The first two ships of this class, the Prinz Adalbert and Hans Georg, were begun in 1926 and completed in 1930, while a third, the Friedrich Carl, was completed in 1931. A following only slightly altered class, the York class, was also constructed in 1933. These classes were armed with four twin 42cm turrets."

GEA_battleship_5_desc:0 "Continuing their status as the world's leading navy, the Germans continued to design and construct capital ships in the early 1930s, even as most of the other naval powers were unable, unwilling, or both, to do so. The Blücher class was a symbol of these efforts, and of German pride in general and gained a considerable degree of notoriety and fame. Begun in 1931, both of these ships, the Blücher and Admiral Scheer, were completed in 1935. They retained the four twin 42cm turret armament of preceding classes, but were faster and possessed of superior armour protection."

The German response, the Nassau class (Nassau, Rheinland, Posen, and Westfalen), were begun in 1907 and completed in 1910. Somewhat lighter and slower than their British counterparts, they carried smaller but more numerous guns, and their designers believed that 'weight of fire' would be more significant than range and individual shell effect (a belief they were disillusioned of after the First Battle of Jutland). They carried six twin 28cm turrets. Their immediate successors, the Helgoland, carried slightly heavier armament, with six twin 30.5cm turrets, while the following Kaiser class carried five twin 30.5cm turrets.

The first two ships, the Bayern and Baden, were laid down in 1913 and completed in 1916 and 1917, respectively. The construction of the following two ships, the Sachsen and Württemberg, was significantly affected by the Weltkrieg; laid down in 1914 and 1915, they were not completed until late 1918 and early 1919, respectively, after the Kaiser had reprioritized work on them. All four would be participants in the Second Battle of Jutland, and would perform well there, though damage sustained by the Sachsen, attributed incorrectly by the British to an arias torpedo strike, would have significant consequences for the future of naval development."
GEA_SH_battleship_5:0 "프로이센"
GEA_SH_battleship_5_desc:0 "With the decision of the Kaiser to disallow unrestricted submarine warfare in January 1917, resources that might otherwise have been directed towards submarine construction were instead directed towards work on surface ships. One result of that was that a new class of dreadnoughts, armed with four twin 42cm turrets, was ordered; construction of two began in late 1917, and two more were laid down in 1918. Freed from the need to conduct major army operations after 1920, the German Empire focused its resources towards confronting its only remaining enemies, and thus began a new, large-scale, ship construction effort. Based on an enlarged Preußen hull, and with armament increased to five twin 42cm turrets, the Siegfrieds were designed to have speed, protection, and firepower, and would join with the Preußens to become the core of the German fleet. Eight of these ships were built."

The cost of these ships was enormous, and many German naval planners decried them as both wasteful and the opposite of the more numerous and agile fleet Germany needed. While five of these ships were started, two in 1923 and three in 1924, once the Dreadnought Race ended the latter three were cancelled; only the Deutschland and Schlesien were completed, both in 1928."
GEA_SH_battleship_7:0 "카이저 빌헬름"
GEA_SH_battleship_7_desc:0 "The final product of the naval arms race, the Kaiser Wilhelm class was designed as a German answer to the huge British and American super-dreadnoughts and was intended to surpass them all. On an unprecedented scale for German ships, they required new construction facilities, which delayed their own construction. Armed with four triple 48cm turrets, this class was easily amongst the most powerful ever even put to paper and was designed for high speed. Her immense size would result in a seemingly unending stream of mechanical problems, even during construction, and the cost was exorbitant. Only one was ever built; begun in late 1925, she was not fully completed until 1932. While further ships of her type were planned the great difficulties of her construction and the German “victory” in the Dreadnought Race led to the German naval command to abandon such leviathan ships and focus available resources on new smaller, more economic vessels that were more suited to the demands of the new far-flung German colonial empire."

GEA_heavy_carrier_1_desc:0 "With news of large British and Japanese converted carrier designs in the later half of the 1920s, a few voices in the German navy called for possible responses. Designs were drafted to answer, and eventually resulted in a proposal to convert one of the Mackensen class battlecruisers into an aircraft carrier, with an intended complement of around 60 aircraft. While the beginnings were drawn on paper, that was as far as the proposal got: very few in the German navy believed in carrier-based planes having potential beyond reconnaissance and counter-reconnaissance, and that role was already filled by the smaller carriers of the Mainz class. As a result, German fleet carrier development was functionally nonexistent during the 1920s and into for the first half of the 1930s."
GEA_heavy_carrier_2:0 "리히트호펜"
GEA_heavy_carrier_2_desc:0 "The sudden unpleasant realization forced upon the German navy that carrier aircraft could be a potent weapon against capitol warships began a rush to rectify the German lack of fleet carriers. The Richthofen class was the result of that effort. While suffering from a lack of experience with fleet carrier operations relative to British and Japanese carriers of the same generation, the Germans were able to draw upon their experience with smaller carriers to allow them to produce a respectable design. That being said, these ships were badly rushed in construction, and suffered considerable issues. The Richthofen class was intended at design to carry almost 80 aircraft but in practice, these ships were normally able to carry approximately 60."

GEA_carrier_1_desc:0 "The first German of the German seaplane carriers, SMS Stuttgart was a converted Königsberg class cruiser, designed to support the German fleet during engagements. Together with SMS Roon a converted armoured cruiser, the two ships were present to assist the German fleet in scouting, a role they were poorly suited for given the limited radio equipment and lack of planes. The Stuttgart could carry 3 seaplanes, while the Roon carried 8."
GEA_carrier_2:0 "마인츠"
GEA_carrier_2_desc:0 "The first real German carriers, the Mainz class were intended to be experimental as well as to provide active reconnaissance for the fleet. Somewhat of a makeshift design, they combined carriage of both seaplanes and normal aircraft, and suffered from a series of early accidents and mechanical problems. Nonetheless, they eventually overcame most of those early issues, and laid the foundation for future German naval aviation. The Mainz was completed in 1925, and was followed by the Rhein and Blumenthal in 1926. These ships normally carried both 13-15 seaplanes and 9-11 wheeled aircraft."

Several of these ships were constructed in the early 1930s, starting with the Maas and Peter Strasser in 1931 and continuing with the Roon in 1932 and the Boelcke in 1933. Maas class carriers normally carried 18-21 aircraft."

On an unprecedented scale for German ships, they required new construction facilities, which delayed their own construction. Armed with four triple 48cm turrets, this class was easily amongst the most powerful ever and was designed for high speed. Her immense size would result in a seemingly unending stream of mechanical problems, and the cost was exorbitant. Only one was ever built; begun in late 1925, she was not fully completed until 1932. While further ships of her type were planned the great difficulties of her construction and the German “victory” in the Dreadnought Race led to the German naval command to abandon such giant ships and focus on new smaller, more economic vessels that were more suited to the demands of the far-flung German colonial empire."

Designs were drafted to answer, and eventually resulted in a proposal to convert one of the Mackensen class battlecruisers into an aircraft carrier, with an intended complement of around 60 aircraft. While the beginnings were drawn on paper, that was as far as the proposal got: very few in the German navy believed in carrier-based planes having potential beyond reconnaissance and counter-reconnaissance, and that role was already filled by the smaller carriers of the Mainz class. As a result, German fleet carrier development was functionally nonexistent during the 1920s and into for the first half of the 1930s."

The Richthofen class was the result of that effort. While suffering from a lack of experience with fleet carrier operations relative to British and Japanese carriers of the same generation, the Germans were able to draw upon their experience with smaller carriers to allow them to produce a respectable design. That being said, these ships were badly rushed in construction, and suffered considerable issues.

Six of these ships, the Moltke (Moltke and Goeben), Seydlitz, and Derfflinger (Derfflinger, Lützow, and Hindenburg) classes, were completed during 1911-1917, and would show themselves to be considerably superior to the less well protected British battlecruisers. The Goeben would spend the war trapped in the Mediterranean, as the Ottoman ship Yavuz Sultan Selim, but the rest of the ships would serve in the major naval battles of the war. Lützow was badly damaged at the First Battle of Jutland and scuttled, while the Moltke would be lost at the Second Battle of Jutland, as the German battlecruisers conducted flanking strikes against the main body of British dreadnoughts, but the rest of these ships would survive the war, with the Goeben remaining in Ottoman service after the Weltkrieg.

The Mainz was completed in 1925, and was followed by the Rhein and Blumenthal in 1926. These ships normally carried both 13-15 seaplanes and 9-11 wheeled aircraft."

GRU_carrier_3_desc:0 "Design work began in the late-1920s on the next generation of German carriers. Incorporating the lessons learned from the Mainz class, these ships were intended to provide the fleet with reconnaissance and light fighter coverage. Their designs were considerably more advanced than that of their predecessor, and represented a significant advancement. Several of these ships were constructed in the early 1930s, starting with the Maas and Peter Strasser in 1931 and continuing with the Roon in 1932 and the Boelcke in 1933. Maas class carriers normally carried 18-21 aircraft."

Both battles of Jutland had significant design impacts, with the most notable being increased priority being given to armour. They were armed with four twin 16 inch turrets.\nDesigned as a continuation of the Lexington class, the Yorktown class were the first American ships classified as 'fast battleships' from construction.

Armed with five triple 18 inch turrets, the newly separated from its 'parent class' Nebraska class would have the heaviest firepower of any ship type when their construction began. The Nebraska was laid down in 1921 and completed in 1925; an additional hull laid down in 1921, but less completed, was suspended in late 1925, and was eventually scrapped, while three further hulls, begun in 1922, were scrapped in 1927.No more hulls had been begun, with Congress increasingly reticent to fund yet more naval construction after 1922."

HUN_light_cruiser_7_desc:0 "The Otranto class was a significant advancement over its predecessors, using autoloading systems designed by Škoda for its primary and secondary armament, greatly improving the rate of fire of its guns. Most of the 20mm autocannons were replaced by 4 mm autocannons."

HUN_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Kaiser Karl VI"
HUN_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The SMS Kaiser Karl VI was the second armoured cruiser built by Austria-Hungary. She displaced over 6000 tons and was armed with two 24cm guns, eight 15cm guns, a wide array of tertiary guns of different calibres, and two torpedo tubes. During the Weltkrieg, the ship was mostly inactive as part of the fleet-in-being plan, as the ship was too slow to operate with the other more modern cruisers in the fleet."
HUN_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Sankt Georg"
HUN_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The SMS Sankt Georg was the third, and final, armoured cruiser in the Austro-Hungarian Kriegsmarine. Her design was slightly heavier and had stronger secondary armament and belt armour. Like her two fellow armoured cruisers she was rendered obsolete fairly quickly and relegated to the reserve, but not without seeing some initial action. The Sankt Georg did, however, participate in the battles for the Straits of Otranto in the latter stages of the war."
HUN_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Franz Ferdinand"
HUN_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "With capital ships becoming larger and less affordable to many nations a trend emerged of reviving the armoured cruiser style as a small capital ship able to destroy enemy cruisers and deter larger capital ships. The cash-strapped Austro-Hungarian Navy eagerly joined the trend, calling them Panzerschiffe. They were used as a stop-gap measure to bolster the main battle fleet and provide a strong ship for coastal defense duties. The resulting Franz Ferdinand-class was armed with ten 24cm guns in twin and triple turrets. While a fairly modest calibre for a ship of its type, the designers hoped that bolstering the number of guns aboard would prove deadly."
HUN_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Triest"
HUN_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Triest class was more similar to the design of the other ships of its type around the world, armed with two triple 30.5cm turrets. While overall similar to the SMS Franz Ferdinand, it did have improved armour, fire-control, and anti-aircraft armament."
HUN_heavy_cruiser_5:0 "Dubrovnik"
HUN_heavy_cruiser_5_desc:0 "With an extra triple turret, bringing the number of 30.5 cm guns to nine, the Dubrovnik-class saw additional improvement in firepower and anti-aircraft capabilities. Otherwise, the SMS Dubrovnik saw further additions to anti-aircraft and dual-purpose armament over the preceding designs."
HUN_heavy_cruiser_6:0 "Praha"
HUN_heavy_cruiser_6_desc:0 "The gun arrangement on the Praha-class was significantly different than its predecessors, and closer to the traditional layout of Austro-Hungarian capital ships since the dreadnought era: ten 30.5cm guns in triple and double turrets, nearly identical to the Tegetthoff class. The irony of a Panzerschiff essentially being a modernised dreadnought was not lost on many observers, and the Praha gained the nickname of Kleintegetthoff 'Little Tegetthoff'."

JAP_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Serious concern within the IJN over the deficit in capital ship numbers that they would face in any future war against a major European power, combined with the budgetary constraints of the late 1920s led the Japanese navy to examine how to somehow reduce the imbalance in combat strength. Aware that many of the vessels they would have to face in such a conflict would likely be older dreadnought types, and in order to attempt to bypass budgetary constraints, the Japanese decided to follow the example of the French Pothuau class, and examine the possibility of constructing new 'non-capital' warships with the armament and speed to confront older capital ships. With smaller designs, the navy was able to skirt the resistance to new capital ship plan, and secure the approval of a modest construction program. The resulting ships of the Furutaka class, the Furutaka and Myoko, were laid down in 1929 and completed in 1932. They were armed with three double 35.6cm turrets."

The Japanese turned to Britain to fill this gap, ordering one battleship, the Fuso, and four armoured cruisers. While the keel was laid down to fit 12 inch guns, the British trials of the 14 inch gun convinced Japan to introduce this design into her new armoured cruisers. One of the early designs to feature this new gun calibre was B-40, with 28 knots and 6-14 inch guns in three turrets. This design was not to go ahead into production though, as the Japanese instead opted for 4 turrets and 8 guns rather than 6, instead travelling 27.5 knots rather than 28, changes that would result in the design of the Kongo class battlecruisers."
JAP_battleship_3:0 "Kongo"
JAP_battleship_3_desc:0 "The first Japanese battlecruisers, the Kongo class were ordered in response to the British Invincible class. The first ship of the class, the Kongo, was the last Japanese capital ship build outside of Japan; her British builder, Vickers, was required to maximize technology transfer to the Japanese during construction. The other three ships, the Hiei, Kirishima, and Haruna, were constructed in Japan. The Kongo, begun in 1911, was completed in 1913, and followed by the Hiei, also begun in 1911, in 1914 and the Kirishima and Haruna, both begun in 1912, also both in 1915. \n Though all ships from the class had received significant modifications in the 1920s already, the Kongo class underwent extensive modernization under the naval programme of 1930, starting with the Haruna in 1933. The reconstruction brought their propulsion and armour more into line with modern fast battleships. All four ships were armed with four twin 14 inch turrets."
JAP_battleship_4:0 "Amagi"
JAP_battleship_4_desc:0 "Initially ordered under the “Eight-Eight” fleet program, the Amagi class was slightly redesigned after Second Jutland, retaining five twin 41cm turrets but with the protection originally planned for the Kii class. The Amagi class suffered a series of delays and misfortunes: many resources for their equipment were shifted to work on the Kii class after the rush towards those ships began, and the Takao was destroyed in the Great Kanto Earthquake. As a result, while two were begun in 1920 and two more in 1921, only two would be finished as designed: the Amagi in 1924, and the Akagi, after years of delay and shortages, in 1926. The third surviving hull, the Atago, languished for years, before eventually being converted into an aircraft carrier and finished in 1927."
JAP_battleship_5:0 "Omi"
JAP_battleship_5_desc:0 "Lack of dockyard and resource availability led to the construction of the third and fourth ships of the Kii class being delayed, which became an 'indefinite' delay with the 1923 Naval Moratorium. As the size of European and American ship construction programs became apparent, Japanese naval architects turned toward more radical designs in an effort to produce the most efficient ships possible. The result was that those last two ships were significantly redesigned, becoming a new 'Omi' class. \n The Omi class had the same four twin 45.7cm turrets as the Kii class, but a more compact armour design, significantly increasing protection of vital systems. They were also reduced in size, relative to the Kii class, in order to allow more resources to be used on the new Aki class. While the work on the Omi class started in 1924, extreme economic problems and resource shortages delayed completion of these ships, with the Omi not completed until 1929 and the Suruga in 1930."
JAP_battleship_6:0 "Izumo"
JAP_battleship_6_desc:0 "The completion of the German Blucher class fast battleships in 1935 led Japanese naval planners to re-open serious consideration of the creation of new capital warships. Several years of contentious budget confrontations with the IJA would be required before funding for these ships could be acquired, and work on the designs progressed unceasingly during them. The final result, acknowledging and addressing complaints about the Omi class from more 'traditional' design proponents, was less 'compressed' than the proceeding class, while still retaining a relatively compact arraignment of key systems. With strong armour protection and three triple 46cm turrets, these were formidable warships, and worthy additions to the IJN."

JAP_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The first Japanese dreadnoughts, and first ships of the original 'Eight-Eight' fleet plan, the Kawachi class (Kawachi and Settsu) were completed in 1912. Their design was a mixture of an improved Satsuma class and German design elements. The Kawachi was lost in 1918, following the an explosion in her ammunition magazine. The Kawachi class was armed with six twin 12 inch turrets. Still in service in the 1930s the Settsu was used primarily as a training ship by the IJN, but was still officially combat-capable."
JAP_SH_battleship_3:0 "Fuso"
JAP_SH_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Fuso class was designed to work in conjunction with the new Kongo class battlecruisers, incorporating into Japanese design the latest British naval design concepts acquired during the construction of those ships. The Fuso was begun in 1912 and completed in 1915, while her sister ship, the Yamashiro, was begun in 1913 and finished in 1917. Both were armed with six twin 14 inch turrets.\nThe Fuso class was first to receive modernization under the naval programme of 1930, and its reconstruction the lengthiest, as the Fuso underwent reconstruction from April 1930 to May 1933 and again from October 1934 to February 1935, and the Yamashiro December 1930 to January 1935, yet the Fuso class were considered fit only for second-rate duty by the IJN by the latter half of that decade."
JAP_SH_battleship_4:0 "Ise"
JAP_SH_battleship_4_desc:0 "Intended as two more ships of the Fuso class, the Ise and Hyuga were delayed by funding issues. Their design was modified, becoming a new Ise class. Their midships turrets were concentrated together, for better protection and survivability, their barbette armour was improved, and they were somewhat lengthened, to allow for increased speed. While design changes may have improved some combat capabilities, they also reduced the available area for crew spaces, resulting in perhaps the worst living conditions of any IJN capital warship. The Ise was begun in 1915 and completed in 1917, while the Hyuga, also begun in 1915, was not finished until 1918. \n They were armed with six twin 14 inch turrets, and both underwent refit and modernization during 1934-35. The Ise class was the last class to receive reconstruction under the 1930 programme."
JAP_SH_battleship_5:0 "Nagato"
JAP_SH_battleship_5_desc:0 "The Nagato and Tosa classes were intended to form the core of the revised 'Eight-Eight' fleet program. The Nagato and Mutsu were completed in 1920 and 1921 but their successors, particularly the Kaga, were hampered by various economic and social factors. From 1919 to 1921, Kobe developed into a hotbed of labor disputes, and work on the Kaga was disrupted again and again by strikes, with the Kawasaki-Mitsubishi Shipyard dispute of 1921 the biggest strike in Japan of the time. By the time they were supposed on the way to completion, the progress on the Kaga was far behind that of the Tosa, while work on larger more powerful ships was already on the fast track and required resources, laborers, and, most importantly, dockyards to build. The Kaga was launched in 1921 but left unfinished before being completed as an aircraft carrier in 1928, while available materials were diverted to finish the Tosa, and 46cm-armed warships of the Kii, Aki, and Omi classes."
JAP_SH_battleship_6:0 "Kii"
JAP_SH_battleship_6_desc:0 "News of work on ships with 18 inch guns in Europe and America detonated Japanese naval plans as effectively as physical bombs. The ensuing 'naval panic' led to a disorganized and frantic reorganization of Japanese ship construction plans, resulting in a shifting of resources towards a redesigned Kii class, up-gunned to a four twin 45.7cm turret design. The strain on resources of this sudden shift greatly affected work on ships already under construction, and only further taxed the Japanese economy. Out of four approved and ordered Kii class battleships, only two were completed after heroic efforts, and orders for other two were withdrawn when the 1923 Naval Moratorium was issued. The Kii, begun in 1922, was launched in 1924 and finished in early 1925, while no degree of effort could prevent the economic strain from affecting the Owari, which was launched in 1924 but not finished until 1927."
JAP_SH_battleship_7:0 "Aki"
JAP_SH_battleship_7_desc:0 "The American and European monster super-battleships of the early-1920s prompted Japanese naval architects to draw up plans for similar ships. Based on the largest and most powerful designs drawn up for the 'Eight-Eight' plan, these were massive warships, armed with four triple 45.7cm turrets and protected by strong armour. The introduction of the Missouri class in America, construction of the Victoria class in Britain, and announcement of the Deutschland class in Germany created a sense of falling behind, and moved the Navy to renounce the 1923 Naval Moratorium. Four of these ships were planned, but only two were ordered; the Aki and Satsuma, laid down in 1924 and launched in 1926. At a time when resources were stretched to the limits of what the economy could safely tolerate, warship production was consuming an unsustainably large proportion. The two ships' construction, even with highest priority, were not completed until 1929. The planned second pair was later shelved."
JAP_SH_battleship_8:0 "Yamato"
JAP_SH_battleship_8_desc:0 "The reevaluation of the role of the heaviest of capital ships in the 1930s led to the concept of slower ships with a focus on extreme protection. This design was the Japanese version of such a ship, armed with four triple 46cm turrets arraigned closely together, to allow for absolute maximum concentration of armour."
JAP_SH_battleship_9:0 "Kazusa"

JAP_heavy_carrier_1:0 "Atago"
JAP_heavy_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Atago and Kaga were products of the Japanese naval rush of the 1920s, combined with belief in the British claims of aerial potential coming out of the Second Battle of Jutland. Both ships were intended to be battleships, but the hulls were sidelined in the rush to build bigger ships as answers to the Europeans and Americans, and further delayed by various issues. Rather than finish more 41cm ships, and with the IJN desiring larger and faster carriers after its experience with the Hosho and Shokaku, it was decided to focus what resources that could be secured for 45.7/46cm-armed battleships and to transform the older hulls into converted carriers. The resulting ships, completed as carriers in 1927 (Atago) and 1928 (Kaga), would provide experience vital to the designing of future Japanese carriers, as well as to their own extensive 1931-35 refits."
JAP_heavy_carrier_2:0 "Sōryū"
JAP_heavy_carrier_2_desc:0 "The early 1930s were a challenging time for the IJN. With reputation damaged by the Triple Intervention in the 20s, and budget conflict with the increasingly assertive IJA, the IJN was forced to confront unpleasant strategic and tactical realities. Those factors had helped shape the decisions that resulted in Japan's converted carriers into the 30s. In the face of numerically superior potential foes, the IJN crafted a new concept of naval warfare: aircraft and capital ships working in tandem, with aircraft striking first then chasing damaged foes, while the main battle line engaged a weakened enemy. The Sōryū class of carriers was one product of this doctrine: the first designed from the keel-up as a carrier Japanese fleet carrier design, it carried nearly as many aircraft as the Kaga or Atago, but much more efficiently. Completed in 1935, the Sōryū set the stage for the future development of Japanese naval aviation, and was able to carry 63 aircraft."

JAP_carrier_1_desc:0 "After Japanese naval aviation began in 1912, with the establishment of the Commission on Naval Aeronautical Research (Kaigun Kokūjutsu Kenkyūkai), several seaplane carriers were converted from other vessels. The first such ship, the Wakamiya, was ready in 1913, and, in 1914, during the Siege of Tsingtao, made history, with the first naval-launched aerial attacks. Several more seaplane carriers were converted by the IJN, and the Wakamiya herself would later be refitted with a launch platform for wheeled aircraft; experience with her would be crucial in the designing of the first Japanese purpose-built carrier, the Hōshō. All of these early seaplane carriers were retired from IJN service by the early 1930s."
JAP_carrier_2:0 "Hōshō"
JAP_carrier_2_desc:0 "The first real Japanese carriers, the Hōshō and her somewhat larger cousin, the Shōkaku, were completed in the early 20s. Though construction of Shōkaku's planned unnamed sister ship was cancelled with the 1923 Naval Moratorium, the pair provided the IJN with valuable experience, and would serve as a stepping stone to larger designs with greater aircraft capacity. As other carriers entered service, they became training ships for new pilots and crew, while remaining available for full service in case of conflict. The Hōshō carried 13-15 aircraft, while the somewhat larger Shōkaku carried 16-19."
JAP_carrier_3:0 "Ryūjō"
JAP_carrier_3_desc:0 "The lack of dockyard space to build capital ships, and belief in the potential of aircraft to participate in naval combat, resulted in the IJN investigating the possibility of constructing a 'support fleet' of relatively small carriers in the mid 1920s. The lack of resources for capital ship production forced such plans to be repeatedly delayed, with construction of the first ship was not begun until 1926.\nWhile initial plans had called for at least four or five of these carriers to be built, the discussion to complete the Kaga and Akagi as carriers combined with relentless budget struggles with the IJA resulted in those plans being reduced first to three and then to only one. Completed in 1929, the Ryūjō, while not as capable as a fleet carrier, nonetheless added to the growing IJN aviation strength, carrying 28-32 aircraft under normal conditions."

The first German response to these ships was the Von der Tann, completed in 1910, was faster and better protected than the British Invincible class, though somewhat less well armed, with four twin 28cm turrets. She fought at, and survived, both battles of Jutland."
MAF_battleship_2:0 "Moltke"
MAF_battleship_2_desc:0 "While the British were producing their battlecruiser designs in significant numbers, the Germans decided to take a somewhat different path, producing battlecruisers with a greater focus on armour protection but somewhat lighter armament. Six of these ships, the Moltke (Moltke and Goeben), Seydlitz, and Derfflinger (Derfflinger, Lützow, and Hindenburg) classes, were completed during 1911-1917, and would show themselves to be considerably superior to the less well protected British battlecruisers. The Goeben would spend the war trapped in the Mediterranean, as the Ottoman ship Yavuz Sultan Selim, but the rest of the ships would serve in the major naval battles of the war. Lützow was badly damaged at the First Battle of Jutland and scuttled, while the Moltke would be lost at the Second Battle of Jutland, as the German battlecruisers conducted flanking strikes against the main body of British dreadnoughts, but the rest of these ships would survive the war, with the Goeben remaining in Ottoman service after the Weltkrieg.

Intended as a class of seven ships, the last three were subsequently altered in design, leaving only the first four as Mackensens. Construction was seriously impeded by the effects of the Weltkrieg, only getting back on track in 1917, following the Kaiser's direct intervention.\nAll four ships participated in the Second Battle of Jutland, where they served with distinction, inflicting serious losses on the British battlecruiser forces present there. The Yorck class, initially intended as additional Mackensens but enlarged and upgunned to four twin 38cm turrets, were not ready in time for the Second Battle of Jutland and have been largely been overshadowed by the ships that preceded and succeeded them. Laid down in 1917, the Yorck, Gneisenau, and Scharnhorst were completed in 1921."
MAF_battleship_4:0 "Prinz Adalbert"
MAF_battleship_4_desc:0 "With the Dreadnought Race over, the German navy found itself in the mid-1920s having to consider its new role, as the guarantor, guardian, and protector of a vast global empire. To secure such a far-flung domain, ships with a balance of speed, armour and firepower as well as extensive range were required, while not being as ruinously expensive as the giants of the preceding trend. German naval architects faced this challenge by re-casting their next generation of battlecruisers into 'fast battleships'. While the Yorck class was retroactively declared to be such, the first of these under the German flag that were designed as such from the start were the Prinz Adalbert class. The first two ships of this class, the Prinz Adalbert and Hans Georg, were begun in 1926 and completed in 1930, while a third, the Friedrich Carl, was completed in 1931.

Begun in 1931, both of these ships, the Blücher and Admiral Scheer, were completed in 1935.

The German response, the Nassau class (Nassau, Rheinland, Posen, and Westfalen), were begun in 1907 and completed in 1910. Somewhat lighter and slower than their British counterparts, they carried smaller but more numerous guns, and their designers believed that 'weight of fire' would be more significant than range and individual shell effect (a belief they were disillusioned of after the First Battle of Jutland). They carried six twin 28cm turrets. Their immediate successors, the Helgoland, carried slightly heavier armament, with six twin 30.5cm turrets, while the following Kaiser class carried five twin 30.5cm turrets.

The first two ships, the Bayern and Baden, were laid down in 1913 and completed in 1916 and 1917, respectively. The construction of the following two ships, the Sachsen and Württemberg, was significantly affected by the Weltkrieg; laid down in 1914 and 1915, they were not completed until late 1918 and early 1919, respectively, after the Kaiser had reprioritized work on them. All four would be participants in the Second Battle of Jutland, and would perform well there, though damage sustained by the Sachsen, attributed incorrectly by the British to an arias torpedo strike, would have significant consequences for the future of naval development."

MAF_SH_battleship_5_desc:0 "With the decision of the Kaiser to disallow unrestricted submarine warfare in January 1917, resources that might otherwise have been directed towards submarine construction were instead directed towards work on surface ships. One result of that was that a new class of dreadnoughts, armed with four twin 42cm turrets, was ordered; construction of two began in late 1917, and two more were laid down in 1918. Freed from the need to conduct major army operations after 1920, the German Empire focused its resources towards confronting its only remaining enemies, and thus began a new, large-scale, ship construction effort. Based on an enlarged Preußen hull, and with armament increased to five twin 42cm turrets, the Siegfrieds were designed to have speed, protection, and firepower, and would join with the Preußens to become the core of the German fleet. Eight of these ships were built."

The cost of these ships was enormous, and many German naval planners decried them as both wasteful and the opposite of the more numerous and agile fleet Germany needed. While five of these ships were started, two in 1923 and three in 1924, once the Dreadnought Race ended the latter three were cancelled; only the Deutschland and Schlesien were completed, both in 1928."

MAF_SH_battleship_7_desc:0 "The final product of the naval arms race, the Kaiser Wilhelm class was designed as a German answer to the huge British and American super-dreadnoughts and was intended to surpass them all. On an unprecedented scale for German ships, they required new construction facilities, which delayed their own construction. Armed with four triple 48cm turrets, this class was easily amongst the most powerful ever even put to paper and was designed for high speed. Her immense size would result in a seemingly unending stream of mechanical problems, even during construction, and the cost was exorbitant. Only one was ever built; begun in late 1925, she was not fully completed until 1932. While further ships of her type were planned the great difficulties of her construction and the German “victory” in the Dreadnought Race led to the German naval command to abandon such leviathan ships and focus available resources on new smaller, more economic vessels that were more suited to the demands of the new far-flung German colonial empire."

MAF_heavy_carrier_1_desc:0 "With news of large British and Japanese converted carrier designs in the later half of the 1920s, a few voices in the German navy called for possible responses. Designs were drafted to answer, and eventually resulted in a proposal to convert one of the Mackensen class battlecruisers into an aircraft carrier, with an intended complement of around 60 aircraft. While the beginnings were drawn on paper, that was as far as the proposal got: very few in the German navy believed in carrier-based planes having potential beyond reconnaissance and counter-reconnaissance, and that role was already filled by the smaller carriers of the Mainz class. As a result, German fleet carrier development was functionally nonexistent during the 1920s and into for the first half of the 1930s."
MAF_heavy_carrier_2:0 "리히트호펜"
MAF_heavy_carrier_2_desc:0 "The sudden unpleasant realization forced upon the German navy that carrier aircraft could be a potent weapon against capitol warships began a rush to rectify the German lack of fleet carriers. The Richthofen class was the result of that effort. While suffering from a lack of experience with fleet carrier operations relative to British and Japanese carriers of the same generation, the Germans were able to draw upon their experience with smaller carriers to allow them to produce a respectable design. That being said, these ships were badly rushed in construction, and suffered considerable issues. The Richthofen class was intended at design to carry almost 80 aircraft but in practice, these ships were normally able to carry approximately 60."

Nonetheless, they eventually overcame most of those early issues, and laid the foundation for future German naval aviation. The Mainz was completed in 1925, and was followed by the Rhein and Blumenthal in 1926. These ships normally carried both 13-15 seaplanes and 9-11 wheeled aircraft."

Their designs were considerably more advanced than that of their predecessor, and represented a significant advancement. Several of these ships were constructed in the early 1930s, starting with the Maas and Peter Strasser in 1931 and continuing with the Roon in 1932 and the Boelcke in 1933. Maas class carriers normally carried 18-21 aircraft."

Both battles of Jutland had significant design impacts, with the most notable being increased priority being given to armour. They were armed with four twin 16 inch turrets.\nDesigned as a continuation of the Lexington class, the Yorktown class were the first American ships classified as 'fast battleships' from construction. Construction began on three in 1923 with another three on order. The economic turmoil after 1925 impacted this class significantly. The Yorktown, nearest to completion, was scheduled to be scrapped, when naval aviation advocates convinced the navy to have her completed as an aircraft carrier.

Six of these ships, the Moltke (Moltke and Goeben), Seydlitz, and Derfflinger (Derfflinger, Lützow, and Hindenburg) classes, were completed during 1911-1917, and would show themselves to be considerably superior to the less well protected British battlecruisers. The Goeben would spend the war trapped in the Mediterranean, as the Ottoman ship Yavuz Sultan Selim, but the rest of the ships would serve in the major naval battles of the war.

RUS_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The last pre-dreadnought dreadnaught design to enter the Imperial Russian Navy service, the Andrey Pervozvannyy Class were originally ordered as the 6th and 7th ship of the Borodino Class but were redesigned after the Russo-Japanese War, with the main difference being the adoption of underwarter armour and the increase in turret size from 120mm to 203mm."
RUS_SH_battleship_3:0 "Gangut"
RUS_SH_battleship_3_desc:0 "Cosidered as the first true Russian dreadnaught design. Taking the experience of the Russian-Japanese war into account, this results in the basic requirement of armour covering all the freeboard to resist HE shells - but its armour is still thinner than battleship of other countries. They're armed with four 305mm /50 triple turrets placed in regular intervals distributed along the length of the ship which later became one of the main characteristics of the Russian dreadnaught, along with sixteen 120mm /49 Vickers gun and four 47mm /40 Hotchkiss guns. Their machinery consisted of 10 Parsons turbines, placing in three engine rooms and working on 4 shafts. At 32,000hp ships should make 21.75 knots, with the maxium speed achievable with 42,000hp for 23 knots. By the time of their completion the Weltkrieg has already ended and were inactive throughout the whole Russian Civil War."

RUS_battleship_3:0 "Izmail"
RUS_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Izmail Class battle-cruisers were class of four vessels authorised in 1914, just before the Weltkrieg. Their design was based on the Imperatritsa Mariya class battleships. They followed the contemporary Russian capital ship building practices of using four triple turrets to house the heavy main armament, strong secondary armament in casemates, and an overall flush-deck. They had a low profile with low draught to fight in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea. Like many Russian ships of this period, the outbreak of the Weltkrieg and the Russian Revolution delayed these ships from being finished in time."

Apart from two destroyers she was the only ship to reach Vladivostok after the disaster of Tsushima, and transferred to the Black Sea in 1911, serving as a seaplane carrier in the Weltkrieg. She was later captured by the advancing German forces in November 1918 and later transfered to the Ukranian government's control."

RUS_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Gromoboi"
RUS_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Gromoboi Class was developed further from the older Ryurik and Rossiya Class with the major improvement being the usage of 3-shaft engines - which allow it to fulfill its convoy hunting role much better than its underpower cousins. The Gromoboi was armed with four 203mm /45 naval guns and sixteen 152 mm /45 naval guns."
RUS_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Ryurik"
RUS_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Taking the experience of the Russian-Japanese war into account, the Ryurik Class was intended for service in battleships squadrons. Ryurik had bigger naval guns, underwater armour and thicker casemate armour compare to its predecessor - which at the same time results in weaker vertical armour and lower speed. Despite these downsides, Ryurik was the one of the most efficient and the best cruiser of Russian Navy when it was first commissioned."

RUS_light_cruiser_2:0 "Svetlana"
RUS_light_cruiser_2_descc:0 "The Svetlana Class had their keels laid prior to the start of the Weltkrieg but the completion of the entire cass was considerably delayed by the Russian defeat in the Eastern front, followed by the Revolution and the Russian Civil War. In the late 1920's, she was finally commissioned for the Russian Navy along with her half-sister Yaroslav. These vessels were the first turbine-driven cruisers of the Russian Navy. They were heavily armed and well-armoured cruisers for ships of their time."

RUS_destroyer_1:0 "Leytenant Shestakov"
RUS_destroyer_1_desc:0 "Taking the experience of the Russian-Japanese war into account, the Leytenant Shestakov Class was developed based on the torpedo cruiser Vsadnik, with the main difference being the increase in dispalcement and the arrangement of the naval guns. They were armed with one 120mm gun, five 75mm guns and 3 torpedo tubes."
RUS_destroyer_2:0 "Novik"
RUS_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The biggest turbine-driven ship type of the Imperial Russian Navy. The Novik Class destroyers were built in multiple series with foreign technical help and possessed a number inter-subclass differences. Common characteristics for all ships including the usage of 102mm/60 guns, powerful torpedo salvo (from eight to twelve 450mm torpedoes in twin-and triple mounts) and, except for the first ship, twin-shaft turbine machinery and a three-funnel outline profile.\n\nNovik was built by the Putilov plant and was equipped with triple-shaft Curtis-AEG-Vulkan and six Vulkan boilers. At the moment of commission she was one of the largest (1,260t), most well armed (four 102mm guns and four twin 450mm torpedo tubes) and fastest destroyer in the world. On the first trials she manage to achieve the average speed of 36.3kts (maximum 37.3kts) at 41,910hp."

However near its completion most of the available diesel engines had already been used up and thus delay their deployment for years.

These first battlecruisers, of the Invincible, Indefatigable, Lion, Queen Mary, and Tiger classes, had particularly light armour, with armament increasing from four twin 12 inch turrets to four twin 13.5 inch turrets as the designs progressed. In total, ten of these ships were built from 1906 to 1914. The battles of Jutland would be cruel to these classes; the Invincible, Indefatigable, and Queen Mary were lost at the First Battle of Jutland, while the Australia, Lion, Princess Royal, and Tiger were sunk at the Second Battle of Jutland."
SAF_battleship_2:0 "리나운"
SAF_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Renown class of battlecruisers began as design modifications of the Revenge class battleships, and were altered in the planning stage to have increased speed and reduced armour. In terms of firepower and armour, they would be superior to previous British battlecruisers, and carry three twin 15 inch turrets. Both ships of the class, the Renown and Repulse, were completed in 1916, too late in the year to fight in the First Battle of Jutland. They both fought at the Second Battle of Jutland, where their armour was shown to be inadequate and they were sunk to the bottom of the ocean."

SAF_battleship_3_desc:0 "Based on the Queen Elizabeth class of dreadnoughts, but with significantly increased speed and lighter armour, the Admiral class of battlecruisers saw several design changes in the wake of the First Battle of Jutland. Work on these ships was begun in 1916, and hastened to a nearly frantic level in 1917, after word was received of German work on their battlecruisers recommencing. As a result, all four ships, the Hood, Anson, Howe, and Rodney, were completed in early-mid 1919 and present at the Second Battle of Jutland; their weak armour led to poor survivability, with both the Anson and the Rodney sunk in combat."
SAF_battleship_4:0 "넬슨"
SAF_battleship_4_desc:0 "In the wake of the Second Battle of Jutland, the British scrambled to replace lost ships and recover total naval superiority. With the battlecruiser force especially mauled, new ships were a top priority. Sharing many characteristics with the new dreadnoughts, the Nelson class had prioritised armour protection of key systems; the ships were heavily armoured for a battlecruiser and carried heavier weapons than their predecessors, with three triple 16 inch turrets. Construction of four ships began in 1919: Nelson, Fisher, Dundonald and Cornwallis. The three ships that remained with the Republicans after the Revolution were renamed as the Marx, Odger, and Quaker.\nAs the Dreadnought Race reached its peak, the British continued efforts to rebuild their battlecruiser forces. An improved Nelson design, the Rodney class were intended to return that force to strength. Just four ships had been completed by 1924, the other four, begun in 1922 and 1923, were not yet completed when the Revolution erupted. One that was mostly finished was seized and taken to Canada, while another was damaged in conflict between dock workers and Royalists."

She was followed in Britain by the Bellerophon class, the St Vincent class (St Vincent, Collingwood, and Vanguard), the Neptune and the Colossus class (Colossus and Hercules). \nThe Vanguard, suffered a magazine explosion in 1917, and was destroyed. During the Revolution, the Hercules, controlled by Revolutionary forces, and actively attacking and sinking non-military ships carrying 'traitors' (mostly families) fleeing the Revolution, was engaged by the Royalist Temeraire and Malaya; while the Hercules was accompanied by St Vincent and Colossus, she was still sunk, and escorts damaged.

They were armed with five twin 13.5 inch turrets.\nA King George V class dreadnought, the Audacious, struck a mine and sank in 1914, while the Monarch, an Orion, was destroyed by German battlecruiser strikes at the Second Battle of Jutland; the other ships all managed to survive the Weltkrieg. During the Revolution, the King George V was called upon by Royalist forces to bombard pro-Revolutionary “mobs”/crowds in London; after sailing up the Thames to do so, she was chased down by the Revolutionary-controlled Queen Elizabeth, and was sunk in the ensuing battle.

SCT_battleship_1_desc:0 "Created by the British, battlecruisers were designed to be a merger of armoured cruiser and battleship, with the speed of the former and firepower of the latter. These first battlecruisers, of the Invincible, Indefatigable, Lion, Queen Mary, and Tiger classes, had particularly light armour, with armament increasing from four twin 12 inch turrets to four twin 13.5 inch turrets as the designs progressed. In total, ten of these ships were built from 1906 to 1914. The battles of Jutland would be cruel to these classes; the Invincible, Indefatigable, and Queen Mary were lost at the First Battle of Jutland, while the Australia, Lion, Princess Royal, and Tiger were sunk at the Second Battle of Jutland."
SCT_battleship_2:0 "리나운"
SCT_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Renown class of battlecruisers began as design modifications of the Revenge class battleships, and were altered in the planning stage to have increased speed and reduced armour. In terms of firepower and armour, they would be superior to previous British battlecruisers, and carry three twin 15 inch turrets. Both ships of the class, the Renown and Repulse, were completed in 1916, too late in the year to fight in the First Battle of Jutland. They both fought at the Second Battle of Jutland, where their armour was shown to be inadequate and they were sunk to the bottom of the ocean."
SCT_battleship_3:0 "애드머럴"
SCT_battleship_3_desc:0 "Based on the Queen Elizabeth class of dreadnoughts, but with significantly increased speed and lighter armour, the Admiral class of battlecruisers saw several design changes in the wake of the First Battle of Jutland. Work on these ships was begun in 1916, and hastened to a nearly frantic level in 1917, after word was received of German work on their battlecruisers recommencing. As a result, all four ships, the Hood, Anson, Howe, and Rodney, were completed in early-mid 1919 and present at the Second Battle of Jutland; their weak armour led to poor survivability, with both the Anson and the Rodney sunk in combat."
SCT_battleship_4:0 "넬슨"
SCT_battleship_4_desc:0 "In the wake of the Second Battle of Jutland, the British scrambled to replace lost ships and recover total naval superiority. With the battlecruiser force especially mauled, new ships were a top priority. Sharing many characteristics with the new dreadnoughts, the Nelson class had prioritised armour protection of key systems; the ships were heavily armoured for a battlecruiser and carried heavier weapons than their predecessors, with three triple 16 inch turrets. Construction of four ships began in 1919: Nelson, Fisher, Dundonald and Cornwallis. The three ships that remained with the Republicans after the Revolution were renamed as the Marx, Odger, and Quaker.\nAs the Dreadnought Race reached its peak, the British continued efforts to rebuild their battlecruiser forces. An improved Nelson design, the Rodney class were intended to return that force to strength. Just four ships had been completed by 1924, the other four, begun in 1922 and 1923, were not yet completed when the Revolution erupted. One that was mostly finished was seized and taken to Canada, while another was damaged in conflict between dock workers and Royalists."
SCT_battleship_5:0 "Bondfield"
SCT_battleship_5_desc:0 "The first new capital ship design created in the Union of Britain, the Bondfield class continued down the design path set by the Nelson and Rodney class, but took it further, tightly packing all of its three triple 16 inch turrets together in an effort to achieve maximum armour protection. The production of these ships was the result of a compromise agreement between the TUC and the military shipbuilder's unions: the TUC pleaded that resources were needed desperately elsewhere, while the shipbuilders demanded work. They reached compromise in 1929: two capital ships would be laid down each year, one carrier, and one fast battleship, the latter to escort and protect the former."

SCT_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Dreadnought (constructed 1905-6) revolutionized capitol warship design, instantly rendering all previous battleships obsolete and triggering a naval arms race between Britain and Germany. She was followed in Britain by the Bellerophon class, the St Vincent class (St Vincent, Collingwood, and Vanguard), the Neptune and the Colossus class (Colossus and Hercules). \nThe Vanguard, suffered a magazine explosion in 1917, and was destroyed. During the Revolution, the Hercules, controlled by Revolutionary forces, and actively attacking and sinking non-military ships carrying 'traitors' (mostly families) fleeing the Revolution, was engaged by the Royalist Temeraire and Malaya; while the Hercules was accompanied by St Vincent and Colossus, she was still sunk, and escorts damaged. Those ships that remained under Republican control were renamed, while the others fled and joined the new Canadian and Australasian navies."
SCT_SH_battleship_3:0 "어라이언"
SCT_SH_battleship_3_desc:0 "The next step in dreadnought design, these ships had heavier armour and larger guns. Those constructed by Britain were the three Orion class, the four King George V class, and the four in the Iron Duke class, constructed between 1910 and 1914. They were armed with five twin 13.5 inch turrets.\nA King George V class dreadnought, the Audacious, struck a mine and sank in 1914, while the Monarch, an Orion, was destroyed by German battlecruiser strikes at the Second Battle of Jutland; the other ships all managed to survive the Weltkrieg. During the Revolution, the King George V was called upon by Royalist forces to bombard pro-Revolutionary “mobs”/crowds in London; after sailing up the Thames to do so, she was chased down by the Revolutionary-controlled Queen Elizabeth, and was sunk in the ensuing battle. Those ships that remained in Britain under Republican control were renamed, while others fled and joined the new Canadian and Australasian navies."

SCT_SH_battleship_6:0 "매그니피슨트"
SCT_SH_battleship_6_desc:0 "The Second Battle of Jutland was a seismic shock to the Royal Navy and triggered a rush of construction trying to regain British naval supremacy. New dreadnoughts, halted since the completion of the Revenge class in 1916, suddenly became top priority. The result was the Magnificent class. They had a radical new design, increasing the armour of key ship areas, with the turrets and a tower bridge located forward of the machinery spaces. Due to this, these ships were significantly better protected than other contemporary designs. Increased firepower was also important and ships were armed with three triple 18 inch turrets.\nFour ships were ordered; the Magnificent and Majestic were begun in 1920 and completed in 1924, while the Illustrious and Victorious were begun in 1921 and completed in 1925. The Magnificent, Majestic, and Victorious would side with the Royalists in the Revolution, fleeing to Canada in its wake, while the Illustrious would remain loyal to Britain, and be renamed the Naseby after the Syndicalists took power."
SCT_SH_battleship_7:0 "빅토리아"
SCT_SH_battleship_7_desc:0 "Even as the British economy struggled to stay afloat, the Royal Navy continued its desperate efforts to regain and secure naval supremacy. Their final effort towards that end was the Victoria class: based on an enlarged Magnificent class design, with additional engines and four triple 18 inch turrets. Immensely expensive, these ships required alterations to the shipyards before work could even begin, delaying their construction. Two were begun in 1923, and two more in 1924, but the British economy was coming apart, and resources were prioritized towards finishing Magnificent and Rodney class ships. As a result when the Revolution exploded, only one of these ships was close to completion; finally finished in 1929, she was renamed from the Victoria to the Owens by the Republican Navy. The other somewhat serviceable hull under construction was, in the wake of the Revolution, to have a much different fate, becoming the basis for the super-carrier Rebecca. The final two hulls, far from completion, were scrapped."

SCT_heavy_carrier_1:0 "Rebecca"
SCT_heavy_carrier_1_desc:0 "Following the Revolution, the new Union of Britain found itself in possession of several incomplete Victoria class hulls. The first and nearest to completion would be finished as designed, while the next most advanced was selected for completion as an aircraft carrier. Far bigger than any other carrier yet constructed, the ship would be transformed into a massively enlarged version of the then recently completed Furious, the post-conversion design of which was heavily borrowed from in work on the larger ship. Completed in 1927, the Rebecca would become the heart of the Republican carrier force. She would undergo a series of refits and alterations, assuming her final form, with island, twin funnels, and nine twin 6 inch turrets, in 1934. Despite, and in part due to, the years of nearly constant alterations, the Rebecca would permanently suffer from mechanical reliability issues. In normal operating conditions, this massive ship carried 96-104 aircraft."
SCT_heavy_carrier_2:0 "Republic"
SCT_heavy_carrier_2_desc:0 "With the ascendancy of the carrier advocates in the Republican navy, when British shipyards were ready to resume ship construction it was almost a foregone conclusion that new, large, aircraft carriers would be a priority. While some radicals advocated building only carriers and no other large warships, eventually a more moderate plan was put in place of a 'one-for-one' fleet: each carrier to have a battleship to protect it. As the terms of the agreement between the TUC and the shipbuilders' unions set a rate of two capital ships to be built per year, this meant that one carrier was to be laid down per year. \nWhile work began on the Republic in 1929, alterations to her design during construction delayed her completion until 1933, the same year that her first sister ship, the Land and Labour begun in 1930, was finished. A new ship of this class was begun each year from 1931 to 1936. The ships of the Republic class normally carried approximately 60 aircraft."

SCT_carrier_1_desc:0 "13 ships were converted into or built as seaplane tenders for the Royal Navy during the Weltkrieg. They carried 1-8 seaplanes, in various degrees of effectiveness of accommodation. Several were lost during the war, and the remainder were, with a handful of exceptions, quickly decommissioned after it."
SCT_carrier_2:0 "아르거스"
SCT_carrier_2_desc:0 "The incomplete hull of the would-be Italian ocean liner Conte Rosso was purchased by the British in 1916 intended to be finished as a carrier with a continuous, full-length flight deck. Completed in 1918, the Argus was finished in time to provide limited air coverage at the Second Battle of Jutland, and then proceeded to serve as the main experimental platform for the early development of British naval aviation. The Revolution would be bloody for her: her crew fought bitterly amongst themselves, with many killed, before Royalist support arrived from nearby ships and decided the outcome. Taken away to Canada it would be several years before the government there could afford to fully repair the damage she suffered during that initial crew combat. Finally repaired in the late 1920s, she was then dispatched to provide the Canadian Pacific fleet with aerial reconnaissance capabilities and fighter protection. The Argus normally carried 15-18 aircraft."
SCT_carrier_3:0 "Eagle"
SCT_carrier_3_desc:0 "Begun in 1913 the Eagle was initially ordered by Chile to be the battleship Almirante Cochrane; the hull was purchased by Great Britain in 1918, with the intent to complete her as an aircraft carrier. Delayed by design alterations, based on learning from trials aboard the Argus, she was not finished until late 1924, and had not yet finished being crewed and supplied to go to sea when the Revolution began. Quickly seized by Revolutionary forces, she was sent into action to fend off probing attacks by Royalist ships. After the war, she was formally renamed from Eagle to Lilburne, and became the core of the naval aviation force for the new Republican Navy. Soon overshadowed by the Rebecca and other large carriers, she was still very valuable in the early development of Republican naval aviation and remained in active service alongside her bigger cousins. The Lilburne normally carried a complement of 25-30 aircraft."

SLO_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Erzherzog Karl ('Archduke Charles') class of battleship were the last pre-dreadnoughts of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. At 10,500 tons they were relatively light, but well designed and protected with 210mm belt armour and armed with 4 24cm main guns. However, by the time the SMS Erzherzog Karl was commissioned in 1906, they had already been rendered obsolete by the launch of the HMS Dreadnought. Regardless, they proved useful during the Weltkrieg in shore bombardment missions and as support to the modern dreadnoughts of the fleet."
SLO_SH_battleship_2:0 "라데츠키"
SLO_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The expansion of the Italian navy led to panic in the Austrian and Hungarian parliaments. The new head of the Kriegsmarine, Admiral Montecuccoli, responded by laying out his plan for modernisation of the fleet; while he intended on building new capital ships in the style of the HMS Dreadnought, limited funds and dock facilities forced him to settle for what would become the SMS Radetzky, a 15,000-ton displacement semi-dreadnought armed with four 30.5cm guns in two turrets and eight 24cm guns in casemates. The ships of the Radetzky class spent the Weltkrieg as part of the fleet and supporting operations on the Adriatic coast."
SLO_SH_battleship_3:0 "테게트호프"
SLO_SH_battleship_3_desc:0 "Frustrated with the Parliaments' frugality and Italy launching its own dreadnought, Montecuccoli worked with Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino and Škoda to design and order a class of dreadnoughts without parliamentary authorisation. The gamble worked, and the three ships of the class were officially sanctioned. The fourth one, SMS Szent István, was built by Ganz-Danubius, as a compromise with the Hungarians. Displacing 20,000 tons and armed with 12 30.5 guns, these ships had a modern if rather uninspired design outside of their triple-gun turrets. Their career in the Weltkrieg was unremarkable until the Battle of Otranto, where the SMS Szent István was caught on film as it sank."

However, they were delayed at the outbreak of war and officially cancelled in 1917. They were to displace around 25,000 tons and have ten 35cm guns in triple and double turrets. The four guns completed by Škoda were eventually used as super-heavy siege guns on the Italian front"
SLO_SH_battleship_5:0 "후냐디"
SLO_SH_battleship_5_desc:0 "While often referred to as the 'Ersatz Monarchs', as they were meant to replace the ageing Monarch coastal defence ships, they differed from the original Eratz design in several ways, as the Hunyadi class improved the design with lessons from the Weltkrieg. The redesign had 38cm guns instead of 35cm and were over 7,000 tons heavier. The Hunyadis were rebuilt and modernised in the mid-1930s with additional anti-air guns, improved fire-control, removal of underwater torpedo tubes, and the addition of catapult seaplanes."
SLO_SH_battleship_6:0 "슈베러 슐라흐트쉬프 I"
SLO_SH_battleship_6_desc:0 "As the Anglo-German Dreadnought Race intensified the Marinetechnische Komitee began design studies of the new generation of battleships, all based on an upscaled Hunyadi using eight or nine 45cm guns in different arrangements. While several designs were submitted in the first Heavy Battleship Project, Austria-Hungary never built such ships, as they would have been far too expensive for a crippled Empire focused on recovering from the Weltkrieg."
SLO_SH_battleship_7:0 "슈베러 슐라흐트쉬프 II"
SLO_SH_battleship_7_desc:0 "The second set of designs for an Austro-Hungarian Heavy Battleship were based on the SMS Kaiser Wilhelm II. Their armament varied from 10 to 12 45cm guns, with some studies even featuring 48cm guns. Of course these fantasy designs, like their predecessors, were never intended to be built and were simply thought experiments; after all the Empire certainly lacked the resources, money, or docks to build these monstrosities."

SLO_battleship_3:0 "슐라흐트크로이처 프로젝트 이프"
SLO_battleship_3_desc:0 "Conceived as a thought experiment during the Weltkrieg, the Schlachtkreuzer projects greatly varied in design. Projekt If, for example, would have carried four twin 35cm guns on the centreline (with two of them superfiring), eighteen 15cm and twelve 9cm guns in casemates, and four 9cm AA guns. In the end, no battlecruisers were ordered at the time, as their use in the Imperial and Royal Navy would have been questionable."
SLO_battleship_4:0 "에르사츠 합스부르크"

SLO_battleship_5_desc:0 "The jewel of the 1937 Naval Plan were the Schwarzenberg class of fast battleships. With ten 38cm guns, 35cm belt armour, and the ability to reach over 30 knots, they were the first Fast Battleships of the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine. Their secondary armament consisted of six twin dual-purpose 12cm turrets, and a number of 40mm and 20mm guns in various twin or quadruple mounts. They were later upgraded with surface radar."

SLO_battleship_7_desc:0 "The Radetzky class, not to be confused with the pre-Weltkrieg semi-dreadnoughts of the same name, was the ultimate fast battleship design of the k.u.k. Navy. Its ten 41cm guns were set in two triple turrets and two twin superfiring turrets on the centreline, similar to the Schwarzenberg-class.

SLO_destroyer_7_desc:0 "This 3000-ton design retained the same armaments as the Vaskapu, but had improved engines for far better speed and greater range, allowing for longer operations. General improvements to AA, ASW, electronics, and fire control supported the upgrade."

SLO_light_cruiser_1:0 "Admiral Spaun"
SLO_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The SMS Admiral Spaun was a Rapidkreuzer, or fast cruiser, designed for scouting purposes, as new realities required the navy to expand beyond coastal defense. It was notable for being the first Austro-Hungarian ship built with steam turbines. As expected for an early light cruiser, it was poorly armoured, and lightly armed, with seven 10 cm guns, a 7cm AA gun, and a 47mm gun. Its torpedo armament was initially limited to two 45cm launchers, but was upgraded during the war to four twin launchers. During the Weltkrieg it saw service as a flotilla leader despite its obsolescence."
SLO_light_cruiser_2:0 "Helgoland"
SLO_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Sometimes known as the Novara-class, the Helgoland-class was a slightly-upgraded Admiral Spaun with heavier armament, designed with Montecuccolo's idea that the Austro-Hungarian Navy would be required to operate outside of the Adriatic in mind. While the SMS Admiral Spaun was a single ship, there were three ships of the Helgoland class: Saida, Helgoland, and Novara, making it the first actual class for modern light cruisers in the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine."
SLO_light_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Njevgovan"
SLO_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Known as the Ersatz Zenta, the Admiral Njevgovan-class was meant to replace the obsolete protected cruisers of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The war delayed their construction, and they would only be built during its final stages. Their armament consisted of two 19cm guns and six 15cm guns, along with two torpedo tubes and four 9 cm guns. They displaced well over 8500 tons, making it a fairly heavy design, consistent with post-war cruiser designs."
SLO_light_cruiser_4:0 "Custozza"
SLO_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Custozza class of cruisers were built by Austria-Hungaery to control the post war Mediterranean Sea, seeing the need for a cruiser capable of long operations and able to fight the new generation of cruisers. It had three twin 19 cm turrets, one fore and two aft, and a pair of torpedo tubes on each side of the ship, along with four 9 cm AA guns. Despite its buky 9500 tons it could still reach a top speed of 32 knots."
SLO_light_cruiser_5:0 "Höchstädt"
SLO_light_cruiser_5_desc:0 "The Höchstädt class was little more than an enlarged Custozza, taking into account the lessons from its predecessors, primarily seeing the addition of a fourth (fore) turret and two additional pair of torpedo tubes for additional firepower. Its anti-aircraft armament was upgraded to 10 cm high-angle guns."
SLO_light_cruiser_6:0 "Karfreit"
SLO_light_cruiser_6_desc:0 "The Karfreit class saw its primary armament slightly upgraded to modern 20 cm guns. Its anti-aircraft complement was further upgraded from its predecessor: four twin 10cm in high-angle turrets with improved fire-control systems, along with an array of 20mm autocannons. The torpedo launchers were also upgraded to triple launchers using 55cm torpedoes."
SLO_light_cruiser_7:0 "Otranto"
SLO_light_cruiser_7_desc:0 "The Otranto class was a significant advancement over its predecessors, using autoloading systems designed by Škoda for its primary and secondary armament, greatly improving the rate of fire of its guns. Most of the 20mm autocannons were replaced by 4 mm autocannons."

SLO_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Kaiser Karl VI"
SLO_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The SMS Kaiser Karl VI was the second armoured cruiser built by Austria-Hungary. She displaced over 6000 tons and was armed with two 24cm guns, eight 15cm guns, a wide array of tertiary guns of different calibres, and two torpedo tubes. During the Weltkrieg, the ship was mostly inactive as part of the fleet-in-being plan, as the ship was too slow to operate with the other more modern cruisers in the fleet."
SLO_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Sankt Georg"
SLO_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The SMS Sankt Georg was the third, and final, armoured cruiser in the Austro-Hungarian Kriegsmarine. Her design was slightly heavier and had stronger secondary armament and belt armour. Like her two fellow armoured cruisers she was rendered obsolete fairly quickly and relegated to the reserve, but not without seeing some initial action. The Sankt Georg did, however, participate in the battles for the Straits of Otranto in the latter stages of the war."
SLO_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Franz Ferdinand"
SLO_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "With capital ships becoming larger and less affordable to many nations a trend emerged of reviving the armoured cruiser style as a small capital ship able to destroy enemy cruisers and deter larger capital ships. The cash-strapped Austro-Hungarian Navy eagerly joined the trend, calling them Panzerschiffe. They were used as a stop-gap measure to bolster the main battle fleet and provide a strong ship for coastal defense duties. The resulting Franz Ferdinand-class was armed with ten 24cm guns in twin and triple turrets. While a fairly modest calibre for a ship of its type, the designers hoped that bolstering the number of guns aboard would prove deadly."
SLO_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Triest"
SLO_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Triest class was more similar to the design of the other ships of its type around the world, armed with two triple 30.5cm turrets. While overall similar to the SMS Franz Ferdinand, it did have improved armour, fire-control, and anti-aircraft armament."
SLO_heavy_cruiser_5:0 "Dubrovnik"
SLO_heavy_cruiser_5_desc:0 "With an extra triple turret, bringing the number of 30.5 cm guns to nine, the Dubrovnik-class saw additional improvement in firepower and anti-aircraft capabilities.

SLO_heavy_cruiser_6_desc:0 "The gun arrangement on the Praha-class was significantly different than its predecessors, and closer to the traditional layout of Austro-Hungarian capital ships since the dreadnought era: ten 30.5cm guns in triple and double turrets, nearly identical to the Tegetthoff class. The irony of a Panzerschiff essentially being a modernised dreadnought was not lost on many observers, and the Praha gained the nickname of Kleintegetthoff 'Little Tegetthoff'."

SVK_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Erzherzog Karl ('Archduke Charles') class of battleship were the last pre-dreadnoughts of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. At 10,500 tons they were relatively light, but well designed and protected with 210mm belt armour and armed with 4 24cm main guns. However, by the time the SMS Erzherzog Karl was commissioned in 1906, they had already been rendered obsolete by the launch of the HMS Dreadnought. Regardless, they proved useful during the Weltkrieg in shore bombardment missions and as support to the modern dreadnoughts of the fleet."
SVK_SH_battleship_2:0 "라데츠키"
SVK_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The expansion of the Italian navy led to panic in the Austrian and Hungarian parliaments. The new head of the Kriegsmarine, Admiral Montecuccoli, responded by laying out his plan for modernisation of the fleet; while he intended on building new capital ships in the style of the HMS Dreadnought, limited funds and dock facilities forced him to settle for what would become the SMS Radetzky, a 15,000-ton displacement semi-dreadnought armed with four 30.5cm guns in two turrets and eight 24cm guns in casemates. The ships of the Radetzky class spent the Weltkrieg as part of the fleet and supporting operations on the Adriatic coast."
SVK_SH_battleship_3:0 "테게트호프"
SVK_SH_battleship_3_desc:0 "Frustrated with the Parliaments' frugality and Italy launching its own dreadnought, Montecuccoli worked with Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino and Škoda to design and order a class of dreadnoughts without parliamentary authorisation. The gamble worked, and the three ships of the class were officially sanctioned. The fourth one, SMS Szent István, was built by Ganz-Danubius, as a compromise with the Hungarians. Displacing 20,000 tons and armed with 12 30.5 guns, these ships had a modern if rather uninspired design outside of their triple-gun turrets. Their career in the Weltkrieg was unremarkable until the Battle of Otranto, where the SMS Szent István was caught on film as it sank."

SVK_SH_battleship_4_desc:0 "In 1914 Austria-Hungary ordered four new battleships based on an improved Tegetthoff design to replace the ageing Monarch-class. However, they were delayed at the outbreak of war and officially cancelled in 1917. They were to displace around 25,000 tons and have ten 35cm guns in triple and double turrets. The four guns completed by Škoda were eventually used as super-heavy siege guns on the Italian front"
SVK_SH_battleship_5:0 "후냐디"
SVK_SH_battleship_5_desc:0 "While often referred to as the 'Ersatz Monarchs', as they were meant to replace the ageing Monarch coastal defence ships, they differed from the original Eratz design in several ways, as the Hunyadi class improved the design with lessons from the Weltkrieg. The redesign had 38cm guns instead of 35cm and were over 7,000 tons heavier. The Hunyadis were rebuilt and modernised in the mid-1930s with additional anti-air guns, improved fire-control, removal of underwater torpedo tubes, and the addition of catapult seaplanes."
SVK_SH_battleship_6:0 "슈베러 슐라흐트쉬프 I"
SVK_SH_battleship_6_desc:0 "As the Anglo-German Dreadnought Race intensified the Marinetechnische Komitee began design studies of the new generation of battleships, all based on an upscaled Hunyadi using eight or nine 45cm guns in different arrangements. While several designs were submitted in the first Heavy Battleship Project, Austria-Hungary never built such ships, as they would have been far too expensive for a crippled Empire focused on recovering from the Weltkrieg."
SVK_SH_battleship_7:0 "슈베러 슐라흐트쉬프 II"
SVK_SH_battleship_7_desc:0 "The second set of designs for an Austro-Hungarian Heavy Battleship were based on the SMS Kaiser Wilhelm II. Their armament varied from 10 to 12 45cm guns, with some studies even featuring 48cm guns. Of course these fantasy designs, like their predecessors, were never intended to be built and were simply thought experiments; after all the Empire certainly lacked the resources, money, or docks to build these monstrosities."

SVK_battleship_3:0 "슐라흐트크로이처 프로젝트 이프"
SVK_battleship_3_desc:0 "Conceived as a thought experiment during the Weltkrieg, the Schlachtkreuzer projects greatly varied in design. Projekt If, for example, would have carried four twin 35cm guns on the centreline (with two of them superfiring), eighteen 15cm and twelve 9cm guns in casemates, and four 9cm AA guns. In the end, no battlecruisers were ordered at the time, as their use in the Imperial and Royal Navy would have been questionable."
SVK_battleship_4:0 "에르사츠 합스부르크"
SVK_battleship_4_desc:0 "As the Schwerer Schlachtschiff project was abandoned, the Marinetechnische Komitee shifted their focus towards a more balanced design. They settled on an upgraded Hunyadi with the same armament (two triple and two twin 38cm main gun turrets), but significantly faster. However, the order was cancelled in the mid-20s, after the Hungarian parliament refused to finance their share of the naval budget."
SVK_battleship_5:0 "슈바르젠베르크"
SVK_battleship_5_desc:0 "The jewel of the 1937 Naval Plan were the Schwarzenberg class of fast battleships. With ten 38cm guns, 35cm belt armour, and the ability to reach over 30 knots, they were the first Fast Battleships of the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine. Their secondary armament consisted of six twin dual-purpose 12cm turrets, and a number of 40mm and 20mm guns in various twin or quadruple mounts. They were later upgraded with surface radar."
SVK_battleship_6:0 "라우돈"
SVK_battleship_6_desc:0 "An upgraded Schwarzenberg, the Laudon-class carried four twin 41cm turrets and had two more 12cm turrets over its predecessors. They also had improved electronics and fire-control systems."
SVK_battleship_7:0 "라데츠키"
SVK_battleship_7_desc:0 "The Radetzky class, not to be confused with the pre-Weltkrieg semi-dreadnoughts of the same name, was the ultimate fast battleship design of the k.u.k. Navy. Its ten 41cm guns were set in two triple turrets and two twin superfiring turrets on the centreline, similar to the Schwarzenberg-class. It also had a total of twenty 12cm guns in ten twin turrets, along with the now-traditional array of 40mm guns for anti-aircraft duties."

SVK_destroyer_1:0 "후자르 / 타트라"
SVK_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Huszár class was the first series of modern destroyers built for the Austro-Hungarian Navy. Displacing 400 tons, they were armed with a 66 mm gun, seven 47 mm guns, and two 45 cm torpedo tubes. They served with distinction during the war, when three of the 14 in were sunk. Most survivors were later retired and scrapped in the interwar period. The Tátra class were similar; enlarged Huszárs with better speed and firepower."
SVK_destroyer_2:0 "에르사츠 트리글라브"
SVK_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Ersatz Triglav class were built in 1917 to replace wartime losses. Compared to the Tátra, they had less secondary guns to make place for a second twin torpedo launcher and an anti-aircraft machine gun."
SVK_destroyer_3:0 "투룰"
SVK_destroyer_3_desc:0 "With three twin torpedo launchers and four 10 cm guns, the Turul-class was conceived as an even heavier design than the Ersatz Triglav, at 1200 tonnes. With a top speed of 35 knots, it was still one of the fastest type of ships at the time of its commissioning."
SVK_destroyer_4:0 "에르사츠 후자르"
SVK_destroyer_4_desc:0 "Meant to replace the aging Huszár destroyers still in service, the Ersatz Huszár was a modern design, and the first Austro-Hungarian destroyer class using twin-gun turrets. Displacing around 1700 tons, it carried two twin 12 cm guns and three triple 45 cm torpedo launchers."
SVK_destroyer_5:0 "빌트슈피체"
SVK_destroyer_5_desc:0 "Part of the 1937 Naval rearmament program, made possible thanks to renewed Hungarian funding, the Wildspitze-class were 2000-ton destroyers meant to support a true Mediterranean fleet. They were armed with two twin dual purpose 12cm turrets and two triple 55cm torpedo launchers, along with a modest array of anti-aircraft machine guns."
SVK_destroyer_6:0 "바스카푸"
SVK_destroyer_6_desc:0 "A slightly-enlarged and heavier Wildspitze, the Vaskapu-class were 2500-ton ships with an extra superfiting aft twin 12cm turret. Torpedo mounts were upgraded from triple to quadruple launchers. Its anti-aircraft machine guns were replaced with fewer, but more effective autocannons. Otherwise, it retained similar maneuverability and speed compared to its predecessor, despite the added displacement."
SVK_destroyer_7:0 "그렌저"
SVK_destroyer_7_desc:0 "This 3000-ton design retained the same armaments as the Vaskapu, but had improved engines for far better speed and greater range, allowing for longer operations. General improvements to AA, ASW, electronics, and fire control supported the upgrade."

SVK_light_cruiser_1:0 "Admiral Spaun"
SVK_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The SMS Admiral Spaun was a Rapidkreuzer, or fast cruiser, designed for scouting purposes, as new realities required the navy to expand beyond coastal defense. It was notable for being the first Austro-Hungarian ship built with steam turbines. As expected for an early light cruiser, it was poorly armoured, and lightly armed, with seven 10 cm guns, a 7cm AA gun, and a 47mm gun. Its torpedo armament was initially limited to two 45cm launchers, but was upgraded during the war to four twin launchers. During the Weltkrieg it saw service as a flotilla leader despite its obsolescence."
SVK_light_cruiser_2:0 "Helgoland"
SVK_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Sometimes known as the Novara-class, the Helgoland-class was a slightly-upgraded Admiral Spaun with heavier armament, designed with Montecuccolo's idea that the Austro-Hungarian Navy would be required to operate outside of the Adriatic in mind. While the SMS Admiral Spaun was a single ship, there were three ships of the Helgoland class: Saida, Helgoland, and Novara, making it the first actual class for modern light cruisers in the k.u.k. Kriegsmarine."
SVK_light_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Njevgovan"
SVK_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Known as the Ersatz Zenta, the Admiral Njevgovan-class was meant to replace the obsolete protected cruisers of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The war delayed their construction, and they would only be built during its final stages. Their armament consisted of two 19cm guns and six 15cm guns, along with two torpedo tubes and four 9 cm guns. They displaced well over 8500 tons, making it a fairly heavy design, consistent with post-war cruiser designs."
SVK_light_cruiser_4:0 "Custozza"
SVK_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Custozza class of cruisers were built by Austria-Hungaery to control the post war Mediterranean Sea, seeing the need for a cruiser capable of long operations and able to fight the new generation of cruisers. It had three twin 19 cm turrets, one fore and two aft, and a pair of torpedo tubes on each side of the ship, along with four 9 cm AA guns. Despite its buky 9500 tons it could still reach a top speed of 32 knots."
SVK_light_cruiser_5:0 "Höchstädt"
SVK_light_cruiser_5_desc:0 "The Höchstädt class was little more than an enlarged Custozza, taking into account the lessons from its predecessors, primarily seeing the addition of a fourth (fore) turret and two additional pair of torpedo tubes for additional firepower. Its anti-aircraft armament was upgraded to 10 cm high-angle guns."
SVK_light_cruiser_6:0 "Karfreit"
SVK_light_cruiser_6_desc:0 "The Karfreit class saw its primary armament slightly upgraded to modern 20 cm guns. Its anti-aircraft complement was further upgraded from its predecessor: four twin 10cm in high-angle turrets with improved fire-control systems, along with an array of 20mm autocannons. The torpedo launchers were also upgraded to triple launchers using 55cm torpedoes."
SVK_light_cruiser_7:0 "Otranto"
SVK_light_cruiser_7_desc:0 "The Otranto class was a significant advancement over its predecessors, using autoloading systems designed by Škoda for its primary and secondary armament, greatly improving the rate of fire of its guns. Most of the 20mm autocannons were replaced by 4 mm autocannons."

SVK_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Kaiser Karl VI"
SVK_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The SMS Kaiser Karl VI was the second armoured cruiser built by Austria-Hungary. She displaced over 6000 tons and was armed with two 24cm guns, eight 15cm guns, a wide array of tertiary guns of different calibres, and two torpedo tubes. During the Weltkrieg, the ship was mostly inactive as part of the fleet-in-being plan, as the ship was too slow to operate with the other more modern cruisers in the fleet."
SVK_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Sankt Georg"
SVK_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The SMS Sankt Georg was the third, and final, armoured cruiser in the Austro-Hungarian Kriegsmarine. Her design was slightly heavier and had stronger secondary armament and belt armour. Like her two fellow armoured cruisers she was rendered obsolete fairly quickly and relegated to the reserve, but not without seeing some initial action. The Sankt Georg did, however, participate in the battles for the Straits of Otranto in the latter stages of the war."
SVK_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Franz Ferdinand"
SVK_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "With capital ships becoming larger and less affordable to many nations a trend emerged of reviving the armoured cruiser style as a small capital ship able to destroy enemy cruisers and deter larger capital ships. The cash-strapped Austro-Hungarian Navy eagerly joined the trend, calling them Panzerschiffe. They were used as a stop-gap measure to bolster the main battle fleet and provide a strong ship for coastal defense duties. The resulting Franz Ferdinand-class was armed with ten 24cm guns in twin and triple turrets. While a fairly modest calibre for a ship of its type, the designers hoped that bolstering the number of guns aboard would prove deadly."
SVK_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Triest"
SVK_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Triest class was more similar to the design of the other ships of its type around the world, armed with two triple 30.5cm turrets. While overall similar to the SMS Franz Ferdinand, it did have improved armour, fire-control, and anti-aircraft armament."
SVK_heavy_cruiser_5:0 "Dubrovnik"
SVK_heavy_cruiser_5_desc:0 "With an extra triple turret, bringing the number of 30.5 cm guns to nine, the Dubrovnik-class saw additional improvement in firepower and anti-aircraft capabilities. Otherwise, the SMS Dubrovnik saw further additions to anti-aircraft and dual-purpose armament over the preceding designs."
SVK_heavy_cruiser_6:0 "Praha"
SVK_heavy_cruiser_6_desc:0 "The gun arrangement on the Praha-class was significantly different than its predecessors, and closer to the traditional layout of Austro-Hungarian capital ships since the dreadnought era: ten 30.5cm guns in triple and double turrets, nearly identical to the Tegetthoff class. The irony of a Panzerschiff essentially being a modernised dreadnought was not lost on many observers, and the Praha gained the nickname of Kleintegetthoff 'Little Tegetthoff'."

Construction was repeatedly delayed, and the design underwent a series of alterations. Both battles of Jutland had significant design impacts, with the most notable being increased priority being given to armour. They were armed with four twin 16 inch turrets.\nDesigned as a continuation of the Lexington class, the Yorktown class were the first American ships classified as 'fast battleships' from construction. Construction began on three in 1923 with another three on order. The economic turmoil after 1925 impacted this class significantly.

Armed with five triple 18 inch turrets, the newly separated from its 'parent class' Nebraska class would have the heaviest firepower of any ship type when their construction began. The Nebraska was laid down in 1921 and completed in 1925; an additional hull laid down in 1921 was suspended in late 1925, and was eventually scrapped, while three further hulls, begun in 1922, were scrapped in 1927.No more hulls had been begun, with Congress increasingly reticent to fund yet more naval construction after 1922."

However, by the time the SMS Erzherzog Karl was commissioned in 1906, they had already been rendered obsolete by the launch of the HMS Dreadnought.

The new head of the Kriegsmarine, Admiral Montecuccoli, responded by laying out his plan for modernisation of the fleet; while he intended on building new capital ships in the style of the HMS Dreadnought, limited funds and dock facilities forced him to settle for what would become the SMS Radetzky, a 15,000-ton displacement semi-dreadnought armed with four 30.5cm guns in two turrets and eight 24cm guns in casemates. The ships of the Radetzky class spent the Weltkrieg as part of the fleet and supporting operations on the Adriatic coast."

TRS_SH_battleship_3_desc:0 "Frustrated with the Parliaments' frugality and Italy launching its own dreadnought, Montecuccoli worked with Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino and Škoda to design and order a class of dreadnoughts without parliamentary authorisation. The gamble worked, and the three ships of the class were officially sanctioned. The fourth one, SMS Szent István, was built by Ganz-Danubius, as a compromise with the Hungarians. Displacing 20,000 tons and armed with 12 30.5 guns, these ships had a modern if rather uninspired design outside of their triple-gun turrets. Their career in the Weltkrieg was unremarkable until the Battle of Otranto, where the SMS Szent István was caught on film as it sank."

The redesign had 38cm guns instead of 35cm and were over 7,000 tons heavier. The Hunyadis were rebuilt and modernised in the mid-1930s with additional anti-air guns, improved fire-control, removal of underwater torpedo tubes, and the addition of catapult seaplanes."

TRS_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The SMS Admiral Spaun was a Rapidkreuzer, or fast cruiser, designed for scouting purposes, as new realities required the navy to expand beyond coastal defense. It was notable for being the first Austro-Hungarian ship built with steam turbines. As expected for an early light cruiser, it was poorly armoured, and lightly armed, with seven 10 cm guns, a 7cm AA gun, and a 47mm gun. Its torpedo armament was initially limited to two 45cm launchers, but was upgraded during the war to four twin launchers.

TRS_light_cruiser_2:0 "Helgoland"
TRS_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Sometimes known as the Novara-class, the Helgoland-class was a slightly-upgraded Admiral Spaun with heavier armament, designed with Montecuccolo's idea that the Austro-Hungarian Navy would be required to operate outside of the Adriatic in mind. While the SMS Admiral Spaun was a single ship, there were three ships of the Helgoland class: Saida, Helgoland, and Novara, making it the first actual class for modern light cruisers in the k.u.k.

TRS_light_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Njevgovan"
TRS_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Known as the Ersatz Zenta, the Admiral Njevgovan-class was meant to replace the obsolete protected cruisers of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The war delayed their construction, and they would only be built during its final stages. Their armament consisted of two 19cm guns and six 15cm guns, along with two torpedo tubes and four 9 cm guns. They displaced well over 8500 tons, making it a fairly heavy design, consistent with post-war cruiser designs."
TRS_light_cruiser_4:0 "Custozza"
TRS_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Custozza class of cruisers were built by Austria-Hungaery to control the post war Mediterranean Sea, seeing the need for a cruiser capable of long operations and able to fight the new generation of cruisers. It had three twin 19 cm turrets, one fore and two aft, and a pair of torpedo tubes on each side of the ship, along with four 9 cm AA guns. Despite its buky 9500 tons it could still reach a top speed of 32 knots."

She displaced over 6000 tons and was armed with two 24cm guns, eight 15cm guns, a wide array of tertiary guns of different calibres, and two torpedo tubes. During the Weltkrieg, the ship was mostly inactive as part of the fleet-in-being plan, as the ship was too slow to operate with the other more modern cruisers in the fleet."
TRS_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Sankt Georg"
TRS_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The SMS Sankt Georg was the third, and final, armoured cruiser in the Austro-Hungarian Kriegsmarine. Her design was slightly heavier and had stronger secondary armament and belt armour. Like her two fellow armoured cruisers she was rendered obsolete fairly quickly and relegated to the reserve, but not without seeing some initial action. The Sankt Georg did, however, participate in the battles for the Straits of Otranto in the latter stages of the war."
TRS_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Franz Ferdinand"
TRS_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "With capital ships becoming larger and less affordable to many nations a trend emerged of reviving the armoured cruiser style as a small capital ship able to destroy enemy cruisers and deter larger capital ships. The cash-strapped Austro-Hungarian Navy eagerly joined the trend, calling them Panzerschiffe. They were used as a stop-gap measure to bolster the main battle fleet and provide a strong ship for coastal defense duties. The resulting Franz Ferdinand-class was armed with ten 24cm guns in twin and triple turrets. While a fairly modest calibre for a ship of its type, the designers hoped that bolstering the number of guns aboard would prove deadly."
TRS_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Triest"
TRS_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Triest class was more similar to the design of the other ships of its type around the world, armed with two triple 30.5cm turrets. While overall similar to the SMS Franz Ferdinand, it did have improved armour, fire-control, and anti-aircraft armament."
TRS_heavy_cruiser_5:0 "Dubrovnik"
TRS_heavy_cruiser_5_desc:0 "With an extra triple turret, bringing the number of 30.5 cm guns to nine, the Dubrovnik-class saw additional improvement in firepower and anti-aircraft capabilities. Otherwise, the SMS Dubrovnik saw further additions to anti-aircraft and dual-purpose armament over the preceding designs."
TRS_heavy_cruiser_6:0 "Praha"
TRS_heavy_cruiser_6_desc:0 "The gun arrangement on the Praha-class was significantly different than its predecessors, and closer to the traditional layout of Austro-Hungarian capital ships since the dreadnought era: ten 30.5cm guns in triple and double turrets, nearly identical to the Tegetthoff class. The irony of a Panzerschiff essentially being a modernised dreadnought was not lost on many observers, and the Praha gained the nickname of Kleintegetthoff 'Little Tegetthoff'."

UKR_SH_battleship_3:0 "Imperatritsa Mariya"
UKR_SH_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Imperatritsa Mariya class was authorised under the 1911 Programme. The preliminary characteristics issued by the Technical Committee provided for 20,000t, 20.5kts battleships armed with 305mm guns. The Naval Staff rejected this idea and demanded 356mm, 22kt ships to follow development trends of the day and to counter the Resadiye class battleships ordered by the Ottomans. Financial problems hampered Naval Staff requirements and the speed was reduced to 21kts and the displacement limited to 21500t normal. The same reason caused abandonment of the 1911 proposals for 24kts and increased protection. The authorised displacement was increased by 1,100t to fulfil requirements already settled on, while Imperatritsa Yekaterina Velikaya exceeded twice this figure. Such a divergence between her and the remaining pair was due to the various supervisory firms of the Russud Yd and Naval Yd, backed by John Brown Yd and Vickers Yd respectively.\n\nThe first pair was completed in 1915 (Yekaterina II was renamed on 27 June 1915) with their light guns outfit varying from the designed one in the light of war experience. Commissioning of 2 dreadnoughts shifted the balance of power in the Black Sea to the Russian side and enabled the Black Sea Fleet to bombard the Turkish and Bulgarian shore installations. The Imperatritsa Mariya capsized in 1916 and were broken up in 1922 while Yekaterina II and Imperator Alexandr III were handed over to the new Ukranian government by the Germans and renamed as Soborna Ukrania and Kyiv, respectively."

WAL_battleship_3_desc:0 "Based on the Queen Elizabeth class of dreadnoughts, but with significantly increased speed and lighter armour, the Admiral class of battlecruisers saw several design changes in the wake of the First Battle of Jutland. Work on these ships was begun in 1916, and hastened to a nearly frantic level in 1917, after word was received of German work on their battlecruisers recommencing. As a result, all four ships, the Hood, Anson, Howe, and Rodney, were completed in early-mid 1919 and present at the Second Battle of Jutland; their weak armour led to poor survivability, with both the Anson and the Rodney sunk in combat."

WAL_battleship_4_desc:0 "In the wake of the Second Battle of Jutland, the British scrambled to replace lost ships and recover total naval superiority. With the battlecruiser force especially mauled, new ships were a top priority. Sharing many characteristics with the new dreadnoughts, the Nelson class had prioritised armour protection of key systems; the ships were heavily armoured for a battlecruiser and carried heavier weapons than their predecessors, with three triple 16 inch turrets. Construction of four ships began in 1919: Nelson, Fisher, Dundonald and Cornwallis. The three ships that remained with the Republicans after the Revolution were renamed as the Marx, Odger, and Quaker.\nAs the Dreadnought Race reached its peak, the British continued efforts to rebuild their battlecruiser forces. An improved Nelson design, the Rodney class were intended to return that force to strength. Just four ships had been completed by 1924, the other four, begun in 1922 and 1923, were not yet completed when the Revolution erupted. One that was mostly finished was seized and taken to Canada, while another was damaged in conflict between dock workers and Royalists."

The production of these ships was the result of a compromise agreement between the TUC and the military shipbuilder's unions: the TUC pleaded that resources were needed desperately elsewhere, while the shipbuilders demanded work. They reached compromise in 1929: two capital ships would be laid down each year, one carrier, and one fast battleship, the latter to escort and protect the former."

She was followed in Britain by the Bellerophon class, the St Vincent class (St Vincent, Collingwood, and Vanguard), the Neptune and the Colossus class (Colossus and Hercules). \nThe Vanguard, suffered a magazine explosion in 1917, and was destroyed. During the Revolution, the Hercules, controlled by Revolutionary forces, and actively attacking and sinking non-military ships carrying 'traitors' (mostly families) fleeing the Revolution, was engaged by the Royalist Temeraire and Malaya; while the Hercules was accompanied by St Vincent and Colossus, she was still sunk, and escorts damaged.

During the Revolution, the King George V was called upon by Royalist forces to bombard pro-Revolutionary “mobs”/crowds in London; after sailing up the Thames to do so, she was chased down by the Revolutionary-controlled Queen Elizabeth, and was sunk in the ensuing battle.

New dreadnoughts, halted since the completion of the Revenge class in 1916, suddenly became top priority. The result was the Magnificent class. They had a radical new design, increasing the armour of key ship areas, with the turrets and a tower bridge located forward of the machinery spaces. Due to this, these ships were significantly better protected than other contemporary designs. Increased firepower was also important and ships were armed with three triple 18 inch turrets.\nFour ships were ordered; the Magnificent and Majestic were begun in 1920 and completed in 1924, while the Illustrious and Victorious were begun in 1921 and completed in 1925. The Magnificent, Majestic, and Victorious would side with the Royalists in the Revolution, fleeing to Canada in its wake, while the Illustrious would remain loyal to Britain, and be renamed the Naseby after the Syndicalists took power."

WAL_SH_battleship_7_desc:0 "Even as the British economy struggled to stay afloat, the Royal Navy continued its desperate efforts to regain and secure naval supremacy. Their final effort towards that end was the Victoria class: based on an enlarged Magnificent class design, with additional engines and four triple 18 inch turrets. Immensely expensive, these ships required alterations to the shipyards before work could even begin, delaying their construction. Two were begun in 1923, and two more in 1924, but the British economy was coming apart, and resources were prioritized towards finishing Magnificent and Rodney class ships. As a result when the Revolution exploded, only one of these ships was close to completion; finally finished in 1929, she was renamed from the Victoria to the Owens by the Republican Navy. The other somewhat serviceable hull under construction was, in the wake of the Revolution, to have a much different fate, becoming the basis for the super-carrier Rebecca. The final two hulls, far from completion, were scrapped."

WAL_heavy_carrier_1_desc:0 "Following the Revolution, the new Union of Britain found itself in possession of several incomplete Victoria class hulls. The first and nearest to completion would be finished as designed, while the next most advanced was selected for completion as an aircraft carrier. Far bigger than any other carrier yet constructed, the ship would be transformed into a massively enlarged version of the then recently completed Furious, the post-conversion design of which was heavily borrowed from in work on the larger ship. Completed in 1927, the Rebecca would become the heart of the Republican carrier force. She would undergo a series of refits and alterations, assuming her final form, with island, twin funnels, and nine twin 6 inch turrets, in 1934. Despite, and in part due to, the years of nearly constant alterations, the Rebecca would permanently suffer from mechanical reliability issues. In normal operating conditions, this massive ship carried 96-104 aircraft."

WAL_heavy_carrier_2_desc:0 "With the ascendancy of the carrier advocates in the Republican navy, when British shipyards were ready to resume ship construction it was almost a foregone conclusion that new, large, aircraft carriers would be a priority. While some radicals advocated building only carriers and no other large warships, eventually a more moderate plan was put in place of a 'one-for-one' fleet: each carrier to have a battleship to protect it. As the terms of the agreement between the TUC and the shipbuilders' unions set a rate of two capital ships to be built per year, this meant that one carrier was to be laid down per year. \nWhile work began on the Republic in 1929, alterations to her design during construction delayed her completion until 1933, the same year that her first sister ship, the Land and Labour begun in 1930, was finished. A new ship of this class was begun each year from 1931 to 1936. The ships of the Republic class normally carried approximately 60 aircraft."

Completed in 1918, the Argus was finished in time to provide limited air coverage at the Second Battle of Jutland, and then proceeded to serve as the main experimental platform for the early development of British naval aviation. The Revolution would be bloody for her: her crew fought bitterly amongst themselves, with many killed, before Royalist support arrived from nearby ships and decided the outcome. Taken away to Canada it would be several years before the government there could afford to fully repair the damage she suffered during that initial crew combat. Finally repaired in the late 1920s, she was then dispatched to provide the Canadian Pacific fleet with aerial reconnaissance capabilities and fighter protection. The Argus normally carried 15-18 aircraft."

Delayed by design alterations, based on learning from trials aboard the Argus, she was not finished until late 1924, and had not yet finished being crewed and supplied to go to sea when the Revolution began. Quickly seized by Revolutionary forces, she was sent into action to fend off probing attacks by Royalist ships. After the war, she was formally renamed from Eagle to Lilburne, and became the core of the naval aviation force for the new Republican Navy. Soon overshadowed by the Rebecca and other large carriers, she was still very valuable in the early development of Republican naval aviation and remained in active service alongside her bigger cousins. The Lilburne normally carried a complement of 25-30 aircraft."

XXA_battleship_2_desc:0 "While the British were producing their battlecruiser designs in significant numbers, the Germans decided to take a somewhat different path, producing battlecruisers with a greater focus on armour protection but somewhat lighter armament. Six of these ships, the Moltke (Moltke and Goeben), Seydlitz, and Derfflinger (Derfflinger, Lützow, and Hindenburg) classes, were completed during 1911-1917, and would show themselves to be considerably superior to the less well protected British battlecruisers. The Goeben would spend the war trapped in the Mediterranean, as the Ottoman ship Yavuz Sultan Selim, but the rest of the ships would serve in the major naval battles of the war. Lützow was badly damaged at the First Battle of Jutland and scuttled, while the Moltke would be lost at the Second Battle of Jutland, as the German battlecruisers conducted flanking strikes against the main body of British dreadnoughts, but the rest of these ships would survive the war, with the Goeben remaining in Ottoman service after the Weltkrieg.

XXA_SH_battleship_5_desc:0 "With the decision of the Kaiser to disallow unrestricted submarine warfare in January 1917, resources that might otherwise have been directed towards submarine construction were instead directed towards work on surface ships. One result of that was that a new class of dreadnoughts, armed with four twin 42cm turrets, was ordered; construction of two began in late 1917, and two more were laid down in 1918. The first two ships, the Preußen, and Hessen, were completed in 1921, while the other two, the Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Oldenburg, followed in 1922. Freed from the need to conduct major army operations after 1920, the German Empire focused its resources towards confronting its only remaining enemies, and thus began a new, large-scale, ship construction effort. Based on an enlarged Preußen hull, and with armament increased to five twin 42cm turrets, the Siegfrieds were designed to have speed, protection, and firepower, and would join with the Preußens to become the core of the German fleet. Eight of these ships were built: the Siegfried (begun in 1919 and completed in 1922), Beowulf (1919-1923), Frithjof (1920-1924), Brynhild (1920-1924), Heimdall (1921-1925), Witege (1921-1925), Hildebrand (1922-26), and Hagen (1922-27)."

Begun in 1917 and 1918, the Nagato and Mutsu were completed in 1920 and 1921, respectively, but pressure to build larger, more powerful ships after Second Jutland, followed by the shifting of resources towards ships with bigger guns, significantly impacted the Tosa class; by the time the they were supposed to be well under way to completion, only enough equipment to finish work on one ship was available. As a result, the Tosa, begun in 1920, was focused on, to be finished in 1924, while the Kaga's hull was left unfinished for years, before later being completed as an aircraft carrier.\nThe Nagato, Mutsu, and Tosa were all refitted and modernized during 1932-34, during the 'capitol ship construction holiday' imposed on the IJN by budgetary and IJA constraints.

Both ships were, initially, intended to be battleships, but both hulls were sidelined in the rush to build bigger ships as answers to the European and American battleships under construction, and further delayed by economic issues. By the time their completion was possible, in the latter half of the 20s, rather than finish more 41cm ships, facing stiff budgetary opposition to more battleships from the IJA, and with the IJN desiring new, larger and faster, carriers after its experience with the Hosho and Shokaku, it was decided focus what resources that could be secured for battleships on the Omi class and to transform the older hulls into converted carriers. The resulting ships, completed as carriers in 1927 (Akagi) and 1928 (Kaga), would provide experience vital to the designing of future Japanese carriers, as well as to their own extensive 1933-35 refits. After their refits, the Akagi carried 66 active aircraft, while the Kaga carried 72."
