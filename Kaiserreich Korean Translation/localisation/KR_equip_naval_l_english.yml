ship_hull_submarine_3:0 "전간기 점수함 선체" #Early Interwar
ship_hull_submarine_3_desc:0 "Significantly larger than preceding submarines, some of these designs were of 'cruiser' type, designed for long-range independent operations in commerce raiding and intended to be better equipped to handle combat with enemy light warships while surfaced.

ship_hull_submarine_5:0 "진보된 잠수함 선체"
ship_hull_submarine_5_desc:0 "The gains made by some earlier designs in extending underwater range, speed, and overall abilities, led to the turn in submarine development away from 'cruiser' types and back towards vessels with a greater emphasis on underwater capabilities. Vastly improved over earlier types, these submarines carried potent payloads of torpedoes and were a legitimate threat to almost all surface ships. However, they were still limited in submerged duration, range, and speed, and remained vulnerable when surfaced, especially to aircraft."
ship_hull_submarine_6:0 "현대 잠수함 선체"
ship_hull_submarine_6_desc:0 "With greatly increased battery capacity, advanced systems to refresh air while still submerged, and overall refined designs, these were the first submarines intended to be able to remain submerged for most of the duration of their time at sea. As such, they marked a massive shift in naval warfare, and the ascendancy of submarines to being true terrors. Such warships offered the ability to dominate the oceans to those nations that developed and deployed them."

ship_hull_light_1:0 "세계대전 이전 경함선 선체"
ship_hull_light_1_desc:0 "The Torpedo Boat Destroyer was the earliest form of destroyer, with the first designs created in 1892. Aimed at protecting the fleet from torpedo boat encounters, these designs were effectively enlarged torpedo boats, designed to be faster and more heavily armed, while still possessing the torpedo attack potential of the torpedo boat. Ships of this type were typically 300-600 tons, and travelled at a top speed of around 26 knots, while carrying a pair of torpedoes and a small armament of guns."
weltkrieg_light_ship_hull_nonmtg:0 "세계대전 경함선 선체"

To meet this need, destroyer designs were streamlined, entering mass production to keep up with demand. Ships of this era were typically 1000 tons, and travelled at a top speed of 34 knots, while carrying a larger pair of torpedoes than their forebears."

ship_hull_light_3:0 "전간기 경함선 선체" #Early Interwar
ship_hull_light_3_desc:0 "After the Weltkrieg, both England and Germany continued mass production of older models of destroyer with only slight improvements. It was not until the collapse of the British government and the end of the dreadnought race that navies worldwide began to analyse in-depth the lessons of the Weltkrieg, and how they might be applied to radically improve existing designs. Larger, improved rangefinders and new anti-submarine weapons were fitted, and multiple torpedo launcher tubes were mounted to improve their combat capability. While the overall size of these destroyers was not much larger than their predecessors, they were significantly more useful with a longer range, better armament, and faster speed."
ship_hull_light_4:0 "개선된 경함선 선체" #Late Interwar
ship_hull_light_4_desc:0 "By 1935, with increasingly potent new aircraft designs entering service, as well as several navies deploying fleet carriers, while there was still some doubt about just how useful the carriers would be in open warfare, concern over the potential threat that aircraft might pose to warships was growing. German carrier operations during the Chinese intervention and continued British exercises had shown the world that the carrier had a purpose in the navy. As a result, this era of destroyer saw the introduction of the dual purpose primary armament, granting a vastly improved anti-aircraft role to the destroyer, again increasing their usefulness. Theses ships would displace up to 2,500 tons, often carrying increased payloads of torpedoes to offset the reduced torpedo loadout on more modern cruisers."
ship_hull_light_5:0 "진보된 경함선 선체"
ship_hull_light_5_desc:0 "With the start of the Second Weltkrieg the world's navies needed cheap anti-aircraft platforms. The British success with carrier combat had shown the world that they were suited for more than just recon and anti-carrier duties, they were required for modern anti-capital ship warfare. Advanced anti-submarine technologies like the new hedgehog depth charges were playing an essential role in combating the major threat to convoy operations, they and the anti-aircraft platforms intensified demands for more destroyers. Were previously destroyer investments were being lowered in favour of cruisers and the new armoured cruisers, destroyers began to return to the fore as an essential part of both the fleet, and the convoy system. While often not larger than their predecessors they were far more technologically advanced, mostly adopting flush decks and far larger torpedo armaments."
ship_hull_light_6:0 "현대 경함선 선체"
ship_hull_light_6_desc:0 "Near the end of the Second Weltkrieg, the navies of the world were forced to adapt: new submarines could stay submerged for almost indefinite periods of time, carriers were loaded full of planes more than capable of destroying capital ships, and big gun cruisers were quickly becoming irrelevant in the face of carriers and submarines. The future role of the escort for the main fleet was being taken over almost solely by destroyers in the minds of most naval theorists, with dual purpose rapid firing turrets destroying any planes that dare cross her path in an attempt to dive bomb her. The displacement of these vessels rose as well, often coming up to 3,000 tons as designers loaded them with more and more anti-aircraft weapons, as well as more primary guns."

ship_hull_cruiser_3_desc:0 "After the end of the Dreadnought Race, most major navies found themselves dealing with reduced budgets and political resistance to the construction of new capital warships. The perceived success of the 7.5 inch guns on the British Hawkins class cruiser during the Second Battle of Jutland during combat with German cruisers and destroyers, as well as a German demand for long-range cruisers, had created a new demand for a larger, more expensive cruiser than the smaller designs seen as most successful during the war. This forced the existing trends in cruiser development towards larger and more heavily armed ships with a much longer range. These ships were the result, with a considerable jump in size over the cruisers of the Weltkrieg. Their increased armour (generally 8 inch or equivalent) made them considerably more potent than the preceding cruiser designs, and would set the standard for cruiser design going forward."
ship_hull_cruiser_4:0 "개선된 순양함 선체" #Interwar
ship_hull_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The interwar period saw refinements of larger cruisers that had appeared since the Dreadnought Race. With politics and finances still constraining many naval powers, the designs produced were only marginally larger in size than the previous generation, instead seeing upgrades in firepower through the use of eight inch guns or the growing adoption of triple turrets and quadruple torpedo tubes. With the importance of aircraft growing in naval warfare, anti-aircraft armament was also considered, leading to the adoption of high-angle dual-purpose mounts for three-five inch guns, supplemented by a growing array of autocannons."
ship_hull_cruiser_5:0 "진보된 순양함 선체"
ship_hull_cruiser_5_desc:0 "Thanks to increased available funding, the new cruisers built at the end of the interwar period and the beginning of the Second Weltkrieg saw another slight growth in their size. Once more, while the the primary armament's calibre remained, with few exceptions, in the 7-8 inch range, their firepower was increased further by adding an extra turret or raising the number of guns in each turret if that had not been done in the previous generation. Secondary armaments were further upgraded with further twin dual-purpose guns and even more dedicated anti-aircraft armament, often linked with improved fire controls. This generation also saw the growing adoption of radar systems on cruisers."

ship_hull_cruiser_6_desc:0 "The cruisers of the late-war and early post-war period remained similar to the ones of the early war, while incorporating the numerous lessons learned throughout. With air power confirmed to be one of the greatest threats to ships, designers focused on improving AA capabilities even further through better fire-control, improving coordination between batteries and radar. Some navies also experimented with autoloading mechanisms for the main armament, dramatically improving their rates of fire. The rapid pace of rocket and missile development would eventually prove to be the demise of all-gun ships, including cruisers, making this the last generation of 'old type' cruisers for numerous navies."

Their design was intended as an intermediate class, with the guns and range to fight older battleships on their own terms as well as the speed to chase down lighter cruisers and escape the more modern battleships they had no chance of beating themselves. Quickly nations such as Ukraine, Austria, and the Two Sicilies received several orders for more ships of this variety, saving the shipbuilding facilities and experience these nations could no longer afford to sustain, and seeing a burst in construction at the birth of this new design type."

Functionally greatly enlarged cruisers with much heavier armour and guns, most of these ships were armed with six to nine main guns of 11-12 inch or equivalent size; these were extremely high velocity gun designs, allowing for the armour penetration and range to engage battleships respectably while also functioning as an effective lone convoy raider more than capable of dealing with escorting destroyers and lighter cruisers."

With their lighter armour the battlecruisers were not able to hold their place on the line, resulting in disastrous losses for the British at the First and Second Battle of Jutland. The heavily armoured German cruisers were adept at holding the line, but were too slow to pursue the enemy fleet even after dealing a crippling blow. The designs from considering these deficits were the 'fast battleships': a battlecruiser armoured nearly as well as a battleship, but with enough speed to chase down anything that might be able to threaten it.

The 'Great Powers' spent the next decade slowly finishing ships already under construction, while focusing development on smaller ships that were easier to slip through the naval budgets. It wasn't until the early 30s that the Great Powers began to experiment with fast battleship designs.

Only a handful of navies built such ships, and their designs varied greatly; their aircraft capacities ranged from the low sixties to over a hundred. There were constants though, such as retained heavily armoured belts and other gun-warship features. Semi-experimental and unreliable, they were still incredibly formidable weapons, and laid the foundations for following generations of fleet carriers."

ship_hull_heavy_carrier_2:0 "개선된 중항공모함 선체" #Early
ship_hull_heavy_carrier_2_desc:0 "The first fleet carriers designed entirely to be such, most of these ships were significantly smaller than their predecessors, but, due to being intentionally centered on the requirements of naval aviation, were also far more reliable in that role. With better anti-aircraft defenses and properly designed runways, they generally carried around sixty aircraft."
ship_hull_heavy_carrier_3:0 "진보된 중항공모함 선체" #Improved
ship_hull_heavy_carrier_3_desc:0 "Continued development of fleet carrier design led to much larger models, with even higher capacities. Increased range and better design of internal systems allowed them to function more effectively as not only part of the fleet, but the centre of one. They retained the features of previous heavy carriers, large secondary batteries to engage enemy vessels at close range and a heavily armoured belt for protection. Most carried around seventy aircraft and with the new deck-edge elevators they were highly efficient at getting those craft into combat as quickly as possible."
ship_hull_heavy_carrier_4:0 "현대 중항공모함 선체"
ship_hull_heavy_carrier_4_desc:0 "The final pre-nuclear evolution of fleet carrier design, these ships approached the size of the first fleet carriers, while incorporating all of the design improvements made in the intervening years. Most had significant armour protection and withering AA firepower, while also being highly mechanically reliable. However, they had given up their large calibre secondary armament in exchange for dual purpose 100-127mm guns. Their general aircraft capacity was, on average, around eighty."
