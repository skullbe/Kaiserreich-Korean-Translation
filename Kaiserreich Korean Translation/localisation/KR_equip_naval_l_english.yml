## Generic Ships 
#ship_hull_submarine_0:0 "Experimental Submarine Hull"
#ship_hull_submarine_0:0 "While there had been several earlier attempts to create submersible weapons of war, the first successful and reproducible submersible warships were produced in the early 1900s. Only capable of brief submersion, and very lightly armed, these designs were more of a proof of concept than real combat-capable warships."
ship_hull_submarine_1:0 "Pre Weltkrieg Submarine Hull"
ship_hull_submarine_1_desc:0 "The first submersible warships actually capable of effective combat actions, these designs were significant improvements over their predecessors. With diesel-electric engines replacing the primarily petrol-electric engines of the first submarines, they had greatly improved range and surface speed. In combat with enemy warships, they acted mainly as submersible light torpedo boats, but lacked the submerged speed or endurance to remain underwater for more than relatively brief periods. These were the submarines that were used by the major naval powers during the Weltkrieg."
weltkrieg_submarine_hull_nonmtg:0 "Weltkrieg Submarine Hull"
weltkrieg_submarine_hull_nonmtg_desc:0 "With increased range and open-ocean capabilities, these ships incorporated the lessons of the Weltkrieg, becoming more able to serve roles such as fleet scouting and long-range patrols, as well as being more potent in tasks such as merchant ship hunting."

ship_hull_submarine_3:0 "Interwar Submarine Hull" #Early Interwar
ship_hull_submarine_3_desc:0 "Significantly larger than preceding submarines, some of these designs were of 'cruiser' type, designed for long-range independent operations in commerce raiding and intended to be better equipped to handle combat with enemy light warships while surfaced. As such, they carried heavier gun armament, and had improved surface speed. Their submerged capabilities, however, remained limited."
ship_hull_submarine_4:0 "Improved Submarine Hull" #Late Interwar
ship_hull_submarine_4_desc:0 "The evolution of the 'cruiser' submarine designs, some of these warships took those ideas further, with larger guns and a greater emphasis on surface abilities, while others began to look in the other direction, seeking to increase underwater capabilities and performance."
ship_hull_submarine_5:0 "Advanced Submarine Hull"
ship_hull_submarine_5_desc:0 "The gains made by some earlier designs in extending underwater range, speed, and overall abilities, led to the turn in submarine development away from 'cruiser' types and back towards vessels with a greater emphasis on underwater capabilities. Vastly improved over earlier types, these submarines carried potent payloads of torpedoes and were a legitimate threat to almost all surface ships. However, they were still limited in submerged duration, range, and speed, and remained vulnerable when surfaced, especially to aircraft."
ship_hull_submarine_6:0 "Modern Submarine Hull"
ship_hull_submarine_6_desc:0 "With greatly increased battery capacity, advanced systems to refresh air while still submerged, and overall refined designs, these were the first submarines intended to be able to remain submerged for most of the duration of their time at sea. As such, they marked a massive shift in naval warfare, and the ascendancy of submarines to being true terrors. Such warships offered the ability to dominate the oceans to those nations that developed and deployed them."

torpedo_tech_one:0 "Wet-heater Torpedo"
torpedo_tech_one_desc:0 "A further improvement from normal air-compressed torpedo was the use of water to cool the combustion chamber of the fuel-burning torpedo. This not only solved heating problems so more fuel could be burned but also allowed additional power to be generated by feeding the resulting steam into the engine together with the combustion products. Torpedoes with such a propulsion system became known as wet heaters"
torpedo_tech_two:0 "Compressed-oxygen Torpedo"
torpedo_tech_two_desc:0 "Since the amount of fuel that can be burned by a torpedo engine (i.e. wet engine) is limited by the amount of oxygen it can carry, compressed-oxygen torpedo which used pure compressed oxygen instead of compressed air had performance unmatched by any contemporary torpedo in service."
torpedo_tech_three:0 "Magnetic Detonator Torpedo"
torpedo_tech_three_desc:0 "A new detonator detects the shift in the earth's magnetic field when the torpedo passes under the target. An explosion directly under a ship causes much more damage and often breaks the keel of the target, sinking it instantly."
torpedo_tech_four:0 "Electric Torpedo"
torpedo_tech_four_desc:0 "Instead of leaving an easily-detected trail of bubbles, a torpedo with an electrical engine remains practically invisible until it hits. This also means that there is no trail leading back to the launching submarine."

torpedo_tech_five_desc:0 "Equipped with an accoustic detector, the torpedo can home in on the biggest source of noise ahead of it - usually the target."

ship_hull_light_1:0 "Pre Weltkrieg Light Ship Hull"
ship_hull_light_1_desc:0 "The Torpedo Boat Destroyer was the earliest form of destroyer, with the first designs created in 1892. Aimed at protecting the fleet from torpedo boat encounters, these designs were effectively enlarged torpedo boats, designed to be faster and more heavily armed, while still possessing the torpedo attack potential of the torpedo boat. Ships of this type were typically 300-600 tons, and travelled at a top speed of around 26 knots, while carrying a pair of torpedoes and a small armament of guns."
weltkrieg_light_ship_hull_nonmtg:0 "Weltkrieg Light Ship Hull"
weltkrieg_light_ship_hull_nonmtg_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg brought a new demand for destroyers: not only were they required to protect their fleets, but they were also stretched thin to protect the Entente shipping lines as well. To meet this need, destroyer designs were streamlined, entering mass production to keep up with demand. Ships of this era were typically 1000 tons, and travelled at a top speed of 34 knots, while carrying a larger pair of torpedoes than their forebears."

ship_hull_light_3:0 "Interwar Light Ship Hull" #Early Interwar
ship_hull_light_3_desc:0 "After the Weltkrieg, both England and Germany continued mass production of older models of destroyer with only slight improvements. It was not until the collapse of the British government and the end of the dreadnought race that navies worldwide began to analyse in-depth the lessons of the Weltkrieg, and how they might be applied to radically improve existing designs. Larger, improved rangefinders and new anti-submarine weapons were fitted, and multiple torpedo launcher tubes were mounted to improve their combat capability. While the overall size of these destroyers was not much larger than their predecessors, they were significantly more useful with a longer range, better armament, and faster speed."
ship_hull_light_4:0 "Improved Light Ship Hull" #Late Interwar
ship_hull_light_4_desc:0 "By 1935, with increasingly potent new aircraft designs entering service, as well as several navies deploying fleet carriers, while there was still some doubt about just how useful the carriers would be in open warfare, concern over the potential threat that aircraft might pose to warships was growing. German carrier operations during the Chinese intervention and continued British exercises had shown the world that the carrier had a purpose in the navy. As a result, this era of destroyer saw the introduction of the dual purpose primary armament, granting a vastly improved anti-aircraft role to the destroyer, again increasing their usefulness. Theses ships would displace up to 2,500 tons, often carrying increased payloads of torpedoes to offset the reduced torpedo loadout on more modern cruisers."
ship_hull_light_5:0 "Advanced Light Ship Hull"
ship_hull_light_5_desc:0 "With the start of the Second Weltkrieg the world's navies needed cheap anti-aircraft platforms. The British success with carrier combat had shown the world that they were suited for more than just recon and anti-carrier duties, they were required for modern anti-capital ship warfare. Advanced anti-submarine technologies like the new hedgehog depth charges were playing an essential role in combating the major threat to convoy operations, they and the anti-aircraft platforms intensified demands for more destroyers. Were previously destroyer investments were being lowered in favour of cruisers and the new armoured cruisers, destroyers began to return to the fore as an essential part of both the fleet, and the convoy system. While often not larger than their predecessors they were far more technologically advanced, mostly adopting flush decks and far larger torpedo armaments."
ship_hull_light_6:0 "Modern Light Ship Hull"
ship_hull_light_6_desc:0 "Near the end of the Second Weltkrieg, the navies of the world were forced to adapt: new submarines could stay submerged for almost indefinite periods of time, carriers were loaded full of planes more than capable of destroying capital ships, and big gun cruisers were quickly becoming irrelevant in the face of carriers and submarines. The future role of the escort for the main fleet was being taken over almost solely by destroyers in the minds of most naval theorists, with dual purpose rapid firing turrets destroying any planes that dare cross her path in an attempt to dive bomb her. The displacement of these vessels rose as well, often coming up to 3,000 tons as designers loaded them with more and more anti-aircraft weapons, as well as more primary guns."

#ship_hull_cruiser_0:0 "Protected Cruiser Hull"
#ship_hull_cruiser_0_desc:0 "Designed with armoured decks but not sides, protected cruisers were common in the navies of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These ships were lighter, faster, and cheaper alternatives to armoured cruisers designed for trade protection and fleet scouting. They were generally armed with 6 inch or equivalent guns."

ship_hull_cruiser_3:0 "Interwar Cruiser Hull" #Post-Dreadnought Race
ship_hull_cruiser_3_desc:0 "After the end of the Dreadnought Race, most major navies found themselves dealing with reduced budgets and political resistance to the construction of new capital warships. The perceived success of the 7.5 inch guns on the British Hawkins class cruiser during the Second Battle of Jutland during combat with German cruisers and destroyers, as well as a German demand for long-range cruisers, had created a new demand for a larger, more expensive cruiser than the smaller designs seen as most successful during the war. This forced the existing trends in cruiser development towards larger and more heavily armed ships with a much longer range. These ships were the result, with a considerable jump in size over the cruisers of the Weltkrieg. Their increased armour (generally 8 inch or equivalent) made them considerably more potent than the preceding cruiser designs, and would set the standard for cruiser design going forward."
ship_hull_cruiser_4:0 "Improved Cruiser Hull" #Interwar
ship_hull_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The interwar period saw refinements of larger cruisers that had appeared since the Dreadnought Race. With politics and finances still constraining many naval powers, the designs produced were only marginally larger in size than the previous generation, instead seeing upgrades in firepower through the use of eight inch guns or the growing adoption of triple turrets and quadruple torpedo tubes. With the importance of aircraft growing in naval warfare, anti-aircraft armament was also considered, leading to the adoption of high-angle dual-purpose mounts for three-five inch guns, supplemented by a growing array of autocannons."
ship_hull_cruiser_5:0 "Advanced Cruiser Hull"
ship_hull_cruiser_5_desc:0 "Thanks to increased available funding, the new cruisers built at the end of the interwar period and the beginning of the Second Weltkrieg saw another slight growth in their size. Once more, while the the primary armament's calibre remained, with few exceptions, in the 7-8 inch range, their firepower was increased further by adding an extra turret or raising the number of guns in each turret if that had not been done in the previous generation. Secondary armaments were further upgraded with further twin dual-purpose guns and even more dedicated anti-aircraft armament, often linked with improved fire controls. This generation also saw the growing adoption of radar systems on cruisers."
ship_hull_cruiser_6:0 "Modern Cruiser Hull"
ship_hull_cruiser_6_desc:0 "The cruisers of the late-war and early post-war period remained similar to the ones of the early war, while incorporating the numerous lessons learned throughout. With air power confirmed to be one of the greatest threats to ships, designers focused on improving AA capabilities even further through better fire-control, improving coordination between batteries and radar. Some navies also experimented with autoloading mechanisms for the main armament, dramatically improving their rates of fire. The rapid pace of rocket and missile development would eventually prove to be the demise of all-gun ships, including cruisers, making this the last generation of 'old type' cruisers for numerous navies."

#ship_hull_carrier_0:0 "Seaplane Carrier Hull"
#ship_hull_carrier_0_desc:0 "The first steps in naval aviation were born from the use of seaplanes. During the Weltkrieg, several navies constructed and deployed seaplane carriers, the first converted from merchant ships, and with later ones build for the purpose. While the promise of naval aviation was demonstrated by these ships and the brave aviators that were based on them, they had major restrictions, and were not effective as weapon systems. Nonetheless, the lessons learned from these early efforts would pave the way for the development of true aircraft carriers."
weltkrieg_carrier_hull_nonmtg:0 "Experimental Carrier Hull"
weltkrieg_carrier_hull_nonmtg_desc:0 "Having learned from the experience of using seaplane tenders, those navies with the resources to do so began work on the next generation of ships that could carry aircraft at sea. Unlike their predecessors, these carriers were designed with flight decks to allow for aircraft to both fly off of them and to then return and land on them. Converted from civilian ships and seaplane tenders, most of these ships were limited by having relatively cramped flight decks and hangars, but they definitely demonstrated that ships were capable of effectively operating air complements at sea."

Even the most critical navies did concede that aircraft were if nothing else, useful for reconnaissance and as a result, those that had the resources built at least a few of these ships."
ship_hull_carrier_3:0 "Improved Carrier Hull" #Improved Interwar
ship_hull_carrier_3_desc:0 "Developed in the late 30s, these ships were designed to provide aerial reconnaissance and light fighter coverage for fleets primarily focused on more 'conventional' warship forces.

ship_hull_carrier_4:0 "Advanced Carrier Hull"
ship_hull_carrier_4_desc:0 "As major naval combat operations in the naval aviation age demonstrated the power of aircraft to seriously affect battles at sea, many powers found themselves having fallen behind in the development of their carrier forces. While heavy carriers were quickly shown to be the most potent of their kin, they were also massive ships that required a long time and large amount of resources to construct. In the rush to increase their ability to project air power into the oceans, several powers turned to designs like these, enlarged versions of the existing lighter carriers, to try to quickly bolster their naval aviation capacity."
ship_hull_carrier_5:0 "Modern Carrier Hull"

ship_hull_panzerschiff_3_desc:0 "In the wake of the Revolution in France, the republican government was left deeply concerned about the shipbuilding capabilities of the Commune. Lacking any real ship production facilities and possessing a limited budget, they were forced to place orders internationally, with the now empty naval yards of the Two Sicilies. Their design was intended as an intermediate class, with the guns and range to fight older battleships on their own terms as well as the speed to chase down lighter cruisers and escape the more modern battleships they had no chance of beating themselves. Quickly nations such as Ukraine, Austria, and the Two Sicilies received several orders for more ships of this variety, saving the shipbuilding facilities and experience these nations could no longer afford to sustain, and seeing a burst in construction at the birth of this new design type."
ship_hull_panzerschiff_4:0 "Improved Panzerschiff Hull"
ship_hull_panzerschiff_4_desc:0 "After the initial wave of armoured cruiser orders from second-rate powers across the world, the design was thoroughly inspected for improvement potential. Better rangefinders were implemented, improvements in triple barreled turret designs were made to reduce weight and improve armour, and additional space was made for more floatplanes to be added to improve the recon ability of the ship. This new generation of designs was widely adopted by South America, where a second naval race had begun to fracture national budgets, as rich nations like Venezuela poured wealth into improving their fleets in the wake of the Chilean revolution."

ship_hull_panzerschiff_5_desc:0 "Progress in Armoured Cruiser design came with a revaluation of the role of these ships, and with adjustments in the trajectory of previous developments. While they retained the mediocre armour of their predecessors, these ships changed course on the path of their guns, generally moving to reduce barrel diameter in favour of gun designs with increased velocity. Most were armed with six main guns, in double or triple turrets, and most of those guns were 11-12 inches or equivalent."
ship_hull_panzerschiff_6:0 "Modern Panzerschiff Hull"
ship_hull_panzerschiff_6_desc:0 "The evolution of the armoured cruiser, by the mid-1940s, had reached its apex: ships with the speed to hunt cruisers but the firepower to threaten true capital warships enough to keep them on their toes. While the firepower of the ships was less useful with the rise of the Carrier, they found great use in shore bombardment and carrier escort duties. Functionally greatly enlarged cruisers with much heavier armour and guns, most of these ships were armed with six to nine main guns of 11-12 inch or equivalent size; these were extremely high velocity gun designs, allowing for the armour penetration and range to engage battleships respectably while also functioning as an effective lone convoy raider more than capable of dealing with escorting destroyers and lighter cruisers."

Early battlecruiser designs favoured light armour and high speeds as well as lighter gun calibres; the flaws of these earlier designs was shown at Jutland, where their armour proved utterly insufficient to perform on the line and many of these early, British-styled, battlecruisers were destroyed."

This style of battlecruiser usually had a somewhat lighter calibre of gun and slower speed, but much heavier armour, making them more fit for staying in the line of battle as a second-rate battleship. The first Battle of Jutland showed the success of this design; the German battlecruisers were much better equipped for a sustained fight than their British counterparts and did significant damage to the British squadrons. Ships of this type were generally armed with 11 to 12 inch guns."

ship_hull_fast_battleship_3_desc:0 "After the Second Battle of Jutland, the concept of the battlecruiser as a faster and less armoured dreadnought designed to hunt smaller ships had been tested and proved wanting. With their lighter armour the battlecruisers were not able to hold their place on the line, resulting in disastrous losses for the British at the First and Second Battle of Jutland. The heavily armoured German cruisers were adept at holding the line, but were too slow to pursue the enemy fleet even after dealing a crippling blow. The designs from considering these deficits were the 'fast battleships': a battlecruiser armoured nearly as well as a battleship, but with enough speed to chase down anything that might be able to threaten it. These designs typically featured 16 to 18 inch guns and battleship-level belt armour."
ship_hull_fast_battleship_4:0 "Improved Fast Battleship Hull" #Interwar
ship_hull_fast_battleship_4_desc:0 "The end of the Dreadnought Race, with the start of the British Revolution, led to large scale naval construction largely ceasing, and naval funding, which had grown to enormous levels in the period up to 1925, finally collapsing. The 'Great Powers' spent the next decade slowly finishing ships already under construction, while focusing development on smaller ships that were easier to slip through the naval budgets. It wasn't until the early 30s that the Great Powers began to experiment with fast battleship designs. These battleship designs were far more modern, with improved rangefinders, powerful oil fired engines, and 16 to 18 inch guns, but were generally iterative, focusing more on delivering a powerful ship at the best price rather than being a drastic improvement over their predecessors."

ship_hull_fast_battleship_5_desc:0 "With the Second Weltkrieg on the horizon and international tensions higher than ever, designers were looking to construct a new generation of ships to fight in the upcoming war. While some nations had transitioned their naval hopes to carriers, others still insisted that the carrier could only provide a supplementary role, rather than replacing the primary anti-capital ship role of the battleship. These nations, typified by Germany, instead retooled their newer designs, focusing on improved armour layouts and more effective guns and turrets, as well as improved speeds."
ship_hull_fast_battleship_6:0 "Modern Fast Battleship Hull"
ship_hull_fast_battleship_6_desc:0 "At the close of the Second Weltkrieg, the Great Powers were faced with an indisputable fact: naval air power had proved victorious over all gun capital ships. However, several nations persisted with the development of Battleships, as shore bombardment platforms, prestige projects and support for carriers within the fleet. Designers loaded their battleships with anti-aircraft batteries, as well as the latest anti-aircraft rocket technology. These designs would prove less than successful over the years; while many of these battleships would continue to be operated well into the 70s, they were widely viewed as obsolete, and mostly functioned to ferry Heads of State on national voyages and to occasionally provide shore bombardment support during regional conflicts."

Her 'all big gun' main armament was significantly more powerful than the mixed batteries of pre-Dreadnoughts, and her steam turbine propulsion granted her superior speed. Navies around the world rushed to copy the British design, leading to an explosion in naval spending and a major increase in the firepower afloat. Most were armed with ten to twelve main guns, in twin turrets, of 11 to 12 inches or equivalent."

ship_hull_dreadnought_1_desc:0 "A jump in size over preceding Dreadnoughts, these 'super-Dreadnoughts' were the escalation of the design innovations of the Dreadnought designs. Faster, with heavier armour, their major distinguishing feature was their superior armament: most carried five twin turrets, with guns of 12 to 13.5 inch or equivalent, arraigned so as to allow all to fire broadside and with fore and aft turrets in a superfiring configuration. This heavier, more concentrated, firepower made them considerably more deadly than the early Dreadnought classes, and these designs would enter the Weltkrieg as the leading warships of major navies. While eclipsed by the new classes devised during the war, they remained formidable warships, and many would remain in service, especially in secondary fleets, for many years after it ended."

#ship_hull_dreadnought_2_5_desc:0 "Incorporating the lessons of first real major naval battles of the Dreadnought Age, most notably the First Battle of Jutland, these designs were highly convergent: increased speed, ever heavier armour, and a main armament of four twin 16 to 16.5 inch or equivalent guns in a two fore, two aft superfiring turret configuration, though some later designs of the type added a fifth turret. Such powerful warships came at great price, and their construction exerted considerable strain on those nations that built them. While begun during the Weltkrieg none were completed in time to take part in it, and as a result their designs remained largely untested. Produced in far greater numbers than the mammoth ships that followed them, these classes would form the cores of most of the world's major navies long after the war, and all the way into the 1930s."

Such vessels set the world's leading naval powers apart from the mere pretenders to greatness, but they had their issues; their rapid development and rushed construction led to design flaws and persistent mechanical problems. These designs were armed with eight to ten 18 inch or equivalent main guns, and had the protection to go toe-to-toe with similarly armed ships."

Far greater in size and firepower than anything that came before, their cost was staggering, and few nations could afford to even consider constructing them. Nonetheless, those that did found themselves in possession of truly mighty weapons of naval supremacy. Even more so than the generation before them, they suffered from the conditions of their conception. Rushed design work, last minute and improvised redesigns during construction, shortages of the huge amount of resources they required, immense pressure to rush construction, and the sheer size and complexity of their massive mechanisms, all led to design flaws and vulnerabilities beneath their vast armoured hides. These designs were armed with twelve to fifteen 18 inch or equivalent main guns."

Discarding speed as a major goal, with the understanding that the new generation of so-called 'fast battleships' would assume that task, these designs instead focused on extreme, unprecedented, armour protection. Advanced 16 inch guns could equal the armour penetration of 18 inches, while being less expensive. .Drawing lessons from the navies possessing heavy ordinance most of these designs were armed with those types of advanced 16 inch guns, or equivalents, normally arranged in five triple turrets."

Girded in nearly impenetrable armour, bristling with anti-aircraft batteries, and armed with six triple 16 inch turrets or equivalent extreme armament, these designs represented the very pinnacle of heavy warship design. Conceived in the twilight of the age of gun warships, these designs were seen as obsolete even before their drafting was completed, mainly by the advocates of ascendant airpower."
