### 1936 Events ###

swe.3.t:0 "Sweden hit by Black Monday"
swe.3.d:0 "When the German market collapsed a few days ago Sweden felt the waves come crashing. Initially there was a small blow but it seemed to stabilise quickly enough... And then it all came crashing down too. After the Weltkrieg Sweden became heavily dependent on Swedish-German trade, either directly with Germany or with their puppet states among the Baltic sea. We'll have to perform several industrial reforms to recover from this!"
swe.3.a:0 "Herre min skapare!"

### Elections ###

### Focus Tree Events ###
swe.500.t:0 "The Air Force Summit"
swe.500.d:0 "The Swedish economy is unable to fulfill the demands recently presented by the navy and air force. The navy is large, but most of the ships are old and in need of replacement. Building a modern fleet to dominate the Baltic would require a huge investment. At the same time, the Swedish air force has presented plans for drastically expanding the service. Sweden could have a huge fleet of modern combat aircraft. But such an investment would require neglecting the Swedish navy. The two services hope to solve convince the government of the merit of their respective arguments."
swe.500.a:0 "We need to decide wisely..."

swe.501.t:0 "The Naval Plan"
swe.501.d:0 "The Swedish Navy has presented its plan for future development. The Naval Board wishes to build new armoured ships, in addition to modern escorts and submarines. The goal is threefold. The navy must be able to protect Sweden's long coast, control the Baltic Sea and project power. Although it has only been suggested, it is clear that marine management is thinking of Åland, Finland and the Baltics."
swe.501.a:0 "Promise more funding"
swe.501.b:0 "The navy won't be prioritized"

swe.502.t:0 "The Air Force Plan"
swe.502.d:0 "The Swedish air force has protested regarding our promise to support the navy plan. They claim that modern aircraft can destroy both enemy armies and ships. A large air force would therefore be more flexible and efficent than the navy."
swe.502.a:0 "Promise them funding as well"
swe.502.b:0 "The air force won't be prioritized"

swe.503.t:0 "The Air Force Plan"
swe.503.d:0 "The Swedish air force has proposed drastically expanding the service. Sweden could have a large air force consisting of modern, indigenous designs."
swe.503.a:0 "Promise more funding"
swe.503.b:0 "The air force won't be prioritized"

swe.504.t:0 "End of the Summit"
swe.504.d:0 "The Air Force Summit has come to an end and the navy has successfully convinced the government to prioritize naval construction."
swe.504.a:0 "A strong navy for the future"

swe.505.t:0 "End of the Summit"
swe.505.d:0 "The Air Force Summit has come to an end and the air force has successfully convinced the government to prioritize the acquisition of new planes."
swe.505.a:0 "A strong air force for the future"

swe.506.t:0 "End of the Summit"
swe.506.d:0 "The Air Force Summit has come to an end and neither branch has been able to successfully convince the government to prioritize military funding. It is clear that the Swedish economy cannot support the development of both a modern navy and a modern air force. Both military leaders and ministers have demanded that the government makes a decision. Which service should recieve priority in the future?"
swe.506.a:0 "We need a strong navy"
swe.506.b:0 "We need a modern air force"

### Leader descriptions ###
POLITICS_Gustaf_V_DESC:0 "Gustaf V Bernadotte was born in 1858 and was the crown-prince of Sweden and Norway from 1872. It is no wonder that he is a man of the old ways, as during his father's reign the King of Sweden acted both as head of state and head of government, with ministers held responsible only to him. However, just two years before Gustaf's ascension to the throne, in 1905 his father had been forced to accept a government chosen by the majority in Parliament. \n\nWhen Gustaf first took the throne in 1907 he also ended a Swedish tradition of roughly 700 years when he refused a coronation. As such, during his reign as a king, he never wore a crown. While at first ambivalent about the Swedish politicians he angered in February 1914, when the Swedish liberal government wanted to cut in military spending. After holding a speech condemning their actions, the liberal government stepped down and was replaced by civil servants appointed by Gustav himself. In the following 1917 elections the Liberals and Social democrats made heavy gains, but Gustaf still attempted installing a conservative government. However, they were unable to form a coalition and Gustaf realised he could no longer appoint governments of his own choosing. During the following reforms, he found himself forced to act upon his minister's advice, and not the other way around. \n\nHe is married to the sickly Queen Victoria of Baden, who is known to be wearing the pants in the Royal household, especially concerning the King's attempted influence in politics in general and the close relations to Germany in particular."
