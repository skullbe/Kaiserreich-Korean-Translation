### Events ###
phil.0.t:0 "A Path Towards Independence"
phil.0.d:0 "The Philippines were a Spanish colony until late 1898, when the United States claimed them as a war prize from Spain. Years of violent struggle for independence followed, and as the economic and political crisis in America began to worsen, they finally bore fruit. In 1934, The Tydings-McDuffie Act was passed, creating the Commonwealth of the Philippines with an elected government under Manuel Quezon and a constitution based upon that of the United States, while Washington retained control of the country's foreign affairs and military. More importantly, it stipulated that after ten years of transition, the archipelago would become a fully independent republic. But storm clouds are gathering over America. Will the Philippines achieve independence sooner than expected, and will that lead to them becoming prey for yet another major empire? Only time will tell..."
phil.0.a:0 "Viva la Filipinas!"
phil.1.t:0 "Syndicalist Uprising in Manilla"
phil.1.d:0 "As we have peacefully achieved independence from the United States due to their chaotic Civil War, our young Commonwealth is already facing the dangers of syndicalism. Inspired by both the Combined Syndicates' uprising in America and by the Bharatiya Commune in India, a group of disgruntled army officers have ordered their units to march towards our capital, where they have joined forces with bands of peasants and industrial workers. They are planning to establish a Syndicalist state on our archipelago!"
phil.1.a:0 "Rebels seize the capital and prepare to establish a Syndicalist regime"
phil.1.b:0 "Order our forces to resist the uprising"
phil.2.t:0 "The Army Counter-Coup"
phil.2.d:0 "Despite the Syndicalist-sympathising units seizing most of downtown Manilla, most of the armed forces are still currently siding with the legal government. Will they join the revolutionaries?"
phil.2.a:0 "The army joins the rebels and the government is toppled"
phil.2.b:0 "Loyal units storm the capital and evict the Syndicalists"
phil.4.t:0 "The Revolution is Defeated"
phil.4.d:0 "As the armed forces declared their support for our government, the rebellious units quickly lost support. After one of our generals drove an armoured column towards downtown Manilla, the syndicalists officially surrendered, ending the threat of a Syndicalist coup in our country. With the army occupying key points in the city, however, a new menace looms over the horizon, there are talks that the military may attempt to take the chance to seize power for themselves and establish a dictatorship of their own."
phil.4.a:0 "The army restores the legal government to power"
phil.4.b:0 "A military dictatorship is established"
phil.6.t:0 "Economical crisis approaching"
phil.6.d:0 "Following the loss of the American protection due to their civil war, our country has lost a great source of income and our economy is nearing a crisis.

Which shall we choose?"

phil.6.b:0 "We must expand our industrial capacity"

phil.7.t:0 "Economical development plan"

phil.7.a:0 "Germany is the world's mightiest nation, they shall help us on this"
phil.7.b:0 "Japan is our natural partner"
phil.7.c:0 "Seek financing from Australasia and the Entente"
phil.7.e:0 "The Commune of France shall help us"

phil.8.b:0 "We'd gain nothing with this"
phil.9.t:0 "A request from the Philippines"

phil.12.t:0 "New factories built with German aid"

phil.14.t:0 "A naval base in the Philippines?"
phil.14.d:0 "Following our first economical aid package to the Philippines, we have created a large network of contacts there. German business are thriving on this new market, but we could also use these new friends to advance the geo-strategic interests of the Reich.

phil.14.a:0 "Propose a deal to their government"
phil.14.b:0 "Don't we have enough bases in Asia already?"
phil.15.t:0 "A proposal from Germany"

The German Imperial Navy has contacted our government, with the proposal of establishing a naval base on the north of our main island, Luzon. Some politicians fear the growing German influence on our country, but a good part of our cabinet believe that we could use their help on a new round of economical expansion plans."

phil.19.t:0 "An alliance with the Philippines?"
phil.19.d:0 "A few years ago, when Thailand entered a military alliance with Japan, we managed to counter this move by convincing Burma to join our own military bloc.

phil.19.a:0 "Not interested"
phil.19.b:0 "Make the proposal"
phil.20.t:0 "Join the German Bloc?"
phil.20.d:0 "A few years ago, Thailand signed a military alliance with the Japanese Empire. Seeing their influence in Asia threatened, the Germans invited the Kingdom of Burma to their Mitteleuropa bloc. Now, this offer has been repeated to us. Should accept their invitation?

Perhaps we could use the opportunity and ask our allies for the territory to be returned to us?"

phil.57.t:0 "New base in the Philippines"
phil.57.d:0 "As previously agreed with the Republic of the Philippines, the new base of the Australasian Navy in the island of Luzon has been inaugurated today. This new facility will help us conducting new operations in the Pacific and put the Japanese and the Germans in check!"

phil.58.d:0 "As previously agreed with the Republic of the Philippines, the new base of the Canadian Navy in the island of Luzon has been inaugurated today. This new facility will help us conducting new operations in the Pacific and put the Japanese and the Germans in check!"
phil.58.a:0 "Great!"
phil.59.t:0 "An alliance with the Philippines?"
phil.59.d:0 "Currently, two major power blocs are present in Southeast Asia- the German Empire has established their presence through their colonies and through an alliance with Burma, while the Japanese cemented an alliance with Thailand. This has left our allies, Australasia, vulnerable to any attack. We should reinforce our position in the region by inviting the Philippines to the Entente."
phil.59.a:0 "Not interested"

phil.60.t:0 "Join the Entente?"
phil.60.d:0 "Two major power blocs are present in Southeast Asia- Germany has established their presence through their colonies and an alliance with Burma, while Japan cemented an alliance with Thailand. This made Australasia vulnerable to any attack. Now, Canada and the Confederation have invited us to their alliance. Should we accept? Even though we will certainly profit through trade deals with Canada and her sphere of influence, we may be dragged into an unwanted conflict against Japan or Germany."

phil.63.d:0 "Representatives from the Philippines have approached us with a plan to prevent a minor economical crisis in their country - they plan to expand their armed forces, thus increasing their industrial output, and wish the Commune helps them on this task. This could prove useful - not only we'd prevent an economical crisis in that country, but we will gain a new friend, countering Japanese and German influence on the Asia-Pacific area and a gaining a springboard for the spread of the Revolution in the region."
phil.63.a:0 "We will help them expanding and modernising of their army"

phil.64.t:0 "A request from the Philippines"
phil.64.d:0 "Representatives from the Philippines have approached us, as they are looking for our help with expanding their industrial output, aiming on becoming a major economical power on Southeast Asia.

phil.66.d:0 "After nearly one year, new infantry units are ready to be deployed. These divisions were developed in our own country, with help from industrial specialists from the Commune of France.

phil.66.a:0 "This is good!"
phil.67.t:0 "New factories built with French aid"
phil.67.d:0 "After nearly one year, a new industrial complex has been inaugurated in Manila. These factories were built with financing and the help of industrial experts from the Commune of France. This will benefit our economy as a whole!"

phil.69.t:0 "Syndicalism in East Asia"
phil.69.d:0 "After our aid programme to the Philippines, some members of our cabinet have thought of considering that nation as our springboard for the spread of Syndicalism in East Asia. Therefore, we should invite them to join our military alliance, the Internationale. Some ministers see East Asia as too much a distant objective for us, but instead propose that we pass the responsibility to the Bharatiya Commune."
phil.69.a:0 "Invite them to the Internationale"
phil.69.b:0 "Promote an alliance of Bharatiya Commune and the Philippines"
phil.69.c:0 "Syndicalism in Asia is a distant goal, not something for now"
phil.70.t:0 "An alliance with the Philippines?"
phil.70.d:0 "The Commune of France, cradle of the Syndicalist Revolution, has been undertaking economical aid programmes with a new socialist republic in Asia, the Philippines. If that young republic ever falls into a war against the bourgeoisie powers, however, France is too far to do much help. Therefore, they have asked us to enter talks with the Philippines and attempt to establish an alliance of syndicalist nations in Asia."
phil.70.a:0 "Not interested, sorry"
phil.70.b:0 "Make the proposal"
phil.701.t:0 "An alliance in syndicalist Asia?"
phil.701.d:0 "The Commune of France, cradle of the Syndicalist Revolution, has been observing with great interest the socialist reforms we've been undertaking on the Philippines. Even if we are a bastion of socialism in Asia, France is too far away, and wouldn't be able to do much in case we get involved in a war. Therefore, they have convinced the Bharatiya Commune to enter talks with us and attempt to establish an alliance of syndicalist nations in Asia."

phil.74.d:0 "Representatives from the Philippines have approached us with a plan to prevent a minor economical crisis in their country - they are planning to expand their armed forces, thus increasing their industrial output and creating jobs for their people. They wish that the United States finance them on this task. This could prove useful - not only we'd prevent an economical crisis in that country, but we will potentially regain the Philippines to our sphere of influence."
phil.74.a:0 "We will finance the expansion and modernisation of their army"

phil.80.t:0 "Re-establishing old ties"
phil.80.d:0 "After our aid programme to the Philippines, some members of our cabinet have considered reestablishing our protection over that country. Even if reestablishing the old US-controlled Commonwealth would be nearly impossible, we should at least try to get them into an alliance with us."
phil.80.a:0 "Contact them"
phil.80.b:0 "We no longer have interests in East Asia"
phil.81.t:0 "A proposal from the Americans"
phil.81.d:0 "Even if our two countries no longer have any political ties as they had before the American Civil War, the United States has been observing with great interest the reforms we've been undertaking on the Philippines. In order to re-establish ties between our two countries, the Americans have offered us entry into the League of American States."
phil.81.a:0 "This is a return to colonialism, we're not interested"

phil.83.d:0 "Even if our two countries no longer have any political ties as they had before the American Civil War, the United States has been observing with great interest the reforms we've been undertaking on the Philippines. In order to re-establish ties between our two countries, the Americans have offered a treaty to put the bad blood behind us and improve relations and business ties between our countries."
phil.83.a:0 "This is a return to colonialism, we're not interested"
phil.83.b:0 "Accept their proposal"
phil.84.t:0 "What to do with the Philippines?"
phil.84.d:0 "The crisis of the 30s is finally behind us and the economy of America is finally back on track. A few congressmen have brought up what to do about the Philippines. Some suggest giving them independence but with American protection over them, while some wish to keep the status quo."
phil.84.a:0 "Offer them Protection"
phil.84.b:0 "Offer them Protection"
phil.84.c:0 "The Status Quo is good."
phil.85.t:0 "A proposal from the Americans"
phil.85.d:0 "The Americans have decided that we should be an independent country. In addition they have offered us entry into the League of American States as a full member.

phil.86.t:0 "A proposal from the Americans"
phil.86.d:0 "The Americans have decided that we should be an independent country.

phil.87.t:0 "The Philippines want full independence"
phil.87.d:0 "The Philippines have rejected our proposal of granting them independence instead claiming that we should grant them full freedom without any strings attached.

A number of politicians suggest giving full independence to them while others suggest that since they rejected our offer to reinforce the Status quo though this option might lead to a war."
phil.87.a:0 "Give it to them!"
phil.87.b:0 "No!"
phil.88.t:0 "The Americans say No!"
phil.88.d:0 "The Americans have said No that we shall not have independence and the status quo shall be re-enforced.
