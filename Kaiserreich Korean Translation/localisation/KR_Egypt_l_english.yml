### Events ###

egy.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Egypt"
egy.1.d:0 "The History of modern Egypt conventionally begins from 1882 when Egypt became part of the British sphere of influence in the region, a situation that conflicted with Egypt's position as part of the Ottoman Empire. In 1914 the Protectorate was made official, and the title of the head of state, which had changed from pasha to khedive in 1867, was changed to sultan, to repudiate the vestigial suzerainty of the Ottoman sultan, who was backing the Central powers in the Weltkrieg. Abbas II was deposed as khedive and replaced by his uncle, Husayn Kamil, as sultan. Upon his death in 1917, his only son, Prince Kamal al-Din Husayn, declined the succession, and Husayn Kamil's brother Ahmed Fuad ascended the throne as Fuad I. With the signing of the Peace of Honour, Egypt remained under British control. However, Arab nationalism led to violent riots which convinced the British to unilaterally declare Egyptian independence in 1922, abolishing the protectorate and establishing an independent Kingdom of Egypt. Britain retained control of the Canal Zone, Sudan and Egypt's external protection. When the 1925 British Revolution broke out, Egypt occupied Sudan, but was forced to give control over the Suez Canal to Germany. Fuad I, who was seen as a British puppet, was forced to flee and was replaced by its predecessor and nephew Abbas II. With the decline of the Ottoman Empire in the recent years, Arabs nationalism is on the rise and Egypt decided to organise the first Congress of Arab Nations, which will be held in 1936. Together with Hejaz, they might try to free the Arabs still living under the Ottoman rule."
egy.1.a:0 "We shall be the masters of our own destiny!"

egy.2.t:0 "Congress of the Arab World"
egy.2.d:0 "Originally an idea of Arab nationalists in Egypt, the planned Congress of Arab Nations will be a huge cultural event of great geopolitical and strategic importance hosted in Cairo. Professors, clerics, historians, novelists, diplomats and even cooks from all corners of the Arab world are invited to join this tribute to Arab culture. This Congress can improve the economic situation in Cairo and our relations with Arab world, however foreign occupiers of Arab lands might view this as threatening Pan-Arabist propaganda."
egy.2.a:0 "Continue preparations for the Congress as planned."
egy.2.b:0 "These plans are too modest, this must be the event of the century!"
egy.2.c:0 "Abort the plans, this Congress is a waste of resources!"

egy.3.t:0 "The Arab Congress"
egy.3.d:0 "After many months of planning, the Arab Congress begins. As guests come flocking in from all Arab lands, it has become clear that the Arab identity is not forgotten, but on the contrary is cherished by many. The streets, marketplaces, and mosques of Cairo are teeming with Arabs from many lands. In the coming days, they will take the stage and deliver addresses and lectures about a variety of subjects ranging from history to religion."
egy.3.a:0 "Truly a great day for all Arabs!"

egy.4.t:0 "The Arab Congress"
egy.4.d:0 "Organised by the Egyptian government, the Arab Congress is a grand event in Cairo where delegates from all Arab nations convene to pay homage to our illustrious Arab heritage. Should we too send a delegation?"
egy.4.a:0 "To Cairo!"
egy.4.b:0 "Pfff... Arabs Shmarabs, we're fine on our own!"

egy.5.t:0 "The Arab Congress"
egy.5.d:0 "Organised by the Egyptian government, the Arab Congress is a grand event in Cairo where delegates from all Arab nations convene to pay homage to our illustrious Arab heritage. We too were invited to send a delegation, this is the perfect opportunity to see if Egypt would be willing to join us in a collaborative effort to free the Arabs of the Ottoman Empire from Turkish occupation."
egy.5.a:0 "Send a cultural delegation only, we aren't warmongers"
egy.5.b:0 "Alongside Egypt we might just bring the Ottomans to their knees!"
egy.5.c:0 "I'm all the Arab this nation needs, nobody is going to Cairo!"

egy.6.t:0 "The Arab Congress"
egy.6.d:0 "Organised by the Egyptian government, the Arab Congress is a grand event in Cairo where delegates from all Arab nations convene to pay homage to our illustrious Arab heritage. Should we too send a delegation?"
egy.6.a:0 "Woman, pack your bags! We're going to Cairo!...Cairo...it's in Egypt baby..."
egy.6.b:0 "A cultural event...? BORING!"

egy.7.t:0 "The Arab Congress"
egy.7.d:0 "Organised by the Egyptian government, the Arab Congress is a grand event in Cairo where delegates from all Arab nations convene to pay homage to our illustrious Arab heritage. Should we too send a delegation?"
egy.7.a:0 "Let's see what the Arabs outside of Yemen are like..."
egy.7.b:0 "Maybe the good people in Cairo can help us get Aden back from the Germans!"
egy.7.c:0 "I can't go to Cairo, I'm busy... There's a rat in my kitchen, what am I gonna do?"

egy.8.t:0 "The Arab Congress"
egy.8.d:0 "Planned by Arab Nationalists in Egypt, the Arab Congress is an event in Cairo where delegates from all Arab nations convene to discuss the situation and preservation of the Arab culture and identity. Unfortunately, this awakened unwanted nationalism in our Arabic speaking provinces."
egy.8.a:0 "...Can't we all just get along?..."

egy.9.t:0 "The Arab Congress"
egy.9.d:0 "Planned by Arab Nationalists in Egypt, the Arab Congress is an event in Cairo where delegates from all Arab nations convene to discuss the situation and preservation of the Arab culture and identity. Unfortunately, this awakened unwanted nationalism in our Arabic speaking provinces."

egy.10.t:0 "The Arab Congress"
egy.10.d:0 "Planned by Arab Nationalists in Egypt, the Arab Congress is an event in Cairo where delegates from all Arab nations convene to discuss the situation and preservation of the Arab culture and identity. Unfortunately, this awakened unwanted nationalism in our Arabic speaking provinces."

egy.11.t:0 "The Arab Congress"
egy.11.d:0 "Planned by Arab Nationalists in Egypt, the Arab Congress is an event in Cairo where delegates from all Arab nations convene to discuss the situation and preservation of the Arab culture and identity. Unfortunately, this awakened unwanted nationalism in our Arabic speaking provinces."

egy.12.t:0 "The Result of the Arab Congress"
egy.12.d:0 "As the cultural events of the Arab Congress winded down, the chamber of delegates began to grow heated with irredentist shouts from the various members of the congress. The Hashemite state in the Hedjaz had been the nucleus of pan-Arabism during the Weltkrieg and it was to Mecca that a huge amount of Arab nationalists from Syria and Mesopotamia emigrated once German reinforcements brought the hitherto victorious Entente to heel. It is widely believed that the dynasty of the Sharif is predetermined to once again spearhead the cause of Arab unification and put the rule of the hated Turk in the dustbin of history. But what of our Egyptian friends?"
egy.12.a:0 "We should ask for support in uniting all Arab lands under Ottoman rule!"
egy.12.b:0 "We must consolidate the Shariffian state."

egy.13.t:0 "The Sharif of Mecca Announces His Ambitions"
egy.13.d:0 "The Arab national government in Mecca has proposed that the Hashemite dynasty be the leading vanguard of pan-Arabism, thus laying claim to all of Ottoman Arabia. How should we respond?"
egy.13.a:0 "God wills it! Lend our support!"
egy.13.b:0 "Propose a partition of the Arab vilayets instead."
egy.13.c:0 "Suggest that OUR dynasty take on the role of Arabian unifier!"
egy.13.e:0 "We have absolutely no interest in this. Zilch. None. Zero."

egy.14.t:0 "Egypt Accepts"
egy.14.d:0 "The Egyptian government has announced its complete support for the ambitions of the Prophet's family! Soon the Turks shall fall before the might of Faisal!"
egy.14.a:0 "Allahu Akbar!"

egy.15.t:0 "Egypt Proposes a Partition of the Ottoman Vilayets"
egy.15.d:0 "The Egyptian government has proposed that we partition the Arab provinces already under Ottoman rule. Under this agreement, Greater Syria would go to Egypt, whilst we receive the fertile Mesopotamian provinces."
egy.15.a:0 "Accept this proposal!"
egy.15.b:0 "Reinforce our claims!"

egy.16.t:0 "Egypt Demands to Lead the Pan-Arab Movement!"
egy.16.d:0 "The Egyptian government has made clear that they aren't willing to allow the Hashemite dynasty to lead the cause of Arab unification. Instead they proposed the House of Muhammad Ali as the true liberator. What shall we respond?"
egy.16.a:0 "A small sacrifice for the freedom of all Arabs."
egy.16.b:0 "Reinforce our claims!"

egy.17.t:0 "Axis Cairo-Mecca?"
egy.17.d:0 "In order to liberate the Arabian peninsula and its inhabitants from the Ottoman Empire we need to form an alliance with other friendly Arabian countries such as Hashemite Arabia, which wants to see the Ottoman Empire crumble and disintegrate just as much as we do."
egy.17.a:0 "Send the proposition"
egy.17.b:0 "There is no need for an alliance"

egy.18.t:0 "Axis Cairo-Mecca?"
egy.18.d:0 "Egypt is seeking allies in order to achieve the main goal of its foreign policy, to see the Ottoman Empire crumble and disintegrate. Do we want to sign an alliance with Egypt knowing that they can involve us in new local wars?"
egy.18.a:0 "Yes, Arabian countries should stand together"
egy.18.b:0 "Isolationism will protect us!"

egy.19.t:0 "Axis Cairo-Mecca is formed"
egy.19.d:0 "Hashemite Arabia expressed its intention to join our alliance aimed at liberating Arabian nations from Ottoman dominance."
egy.19.a:0 "Welcome!"

egy.20.t:0 "Persian ambitions"
egy.20.d:0 "Egypt and Hashemite Arabia recently formed a new alliance aimed at the liberation of all Arabian lands from Ottoman dominance. Their goal is partially consistent with our desire to seize control over Mosul and Baghdad Vilayets. Shall we try to join their alliance or shall we wage war against the Ottomans on our own?"
egy.20.a:0 "Try to join the Arabian bloc."
egy.20.b:0 "We do not need Arabs to crush the Ottomans!"
egy.20.c:0 "Turn to isolationism!"

egy.21.t:0 "Persia wants to join our alliance"
egy.21.d:0 "Persia is seeking allies in order to achieve the main goal of its foreign policy, to seize Mosul and Baghdad Vilayets. Do we want to admit Persia as a new member of our alliance?"
egy.21.a:0 "Yes, we shall destroy Ottomans together.."
egy.21.b:0 "Refuse, they are not Arabs!"

egy.22.t:0 "Axis Cairo-Teheran-Mecca is formed"

egy.23.t:0 "Report from the Middle East"
egy.23.d:0 "Our secret service reported that Egypt, together with other states in the Middle East, is planning to dismantle the Ottoman Empire in the future. Such drastic steps are a direct threat to the stability of the entire Middle East arrangement, which was set by the Peace with Honour signed in 1921. What shall we do?"
egy.23.a:0 "Very interesting..."
egy.23.b:0 "We don't care about the fate of the Ottoman Empire..."

egy.24.t:0 "German Empire warns the Middle Eastern states!"
egy.24.d:0 "The German Kaiser declared clearly that his Empire would fully support the independence and territorial integrity of the Ottoman Empire if any nation tries to invade them. It would be most unwise to underestimate them, despite troubles they are facing on the home front. How shall we react to this statement?"
egy.24.a:0 "Who cares?"
egy.24.b:0 "Withhold our plans against Ottoman Empire..."
egy.24.c:0 "Give up our plans of expansion"

egy.25.t:0 "Middle Eastern states ignored our demands"
egy.25.d:0 "The Middle Eastern states in their foolish pride refused our reasonable demands regarding the territorial integrity and independence of the Ottoman Empire. How shall we react to this insolence?"
egy.25.a:0 "Cease all contact with the Middle Eastern states and support the Ottomans!"
egy.25.b:0 "Insolent brats! We will show you German might!"
egy.25.c:0 "Back down. We cannot afford conflict in the Middle East."

egy.26.t:0 "Mitteleuropa ceases all contracts with us!"
egy.26.d:0 "Reacting to our refusal to alter our plans regarding the Ottoman Empire, the German Empire ordered the cessation of all trade and diplomatic contacts between our state and Mitteleuropa. Parts of our industry are already feeling the consequences of such drastic actions."

Now that the days of the Ottoman government are numbered, shall we finally realise our long-term plans and liberate occupied Arabian lands or shall we wait for a better time?"
egy.28.a:0 "Declare war on the Ottomans!"
egy.28.b:0 "We are not ready..."

egy.29.t:0 "Ottoman Empire is isolated"
egy.29.d:0 "With eruption of the new grand conflict in Europe, German Empire has its hand tied and cant directly interfere in the Middle East. Therefore, Ottoman Empire is isolated and cant rely on intervention of its old ally to save them from inevitable. Now that the days of the Ottoman Empire are numbered, shall we finally realise our long-term plans and liberate occupied Arabian lands or shall we wait for a better time?"
egy.29.a:0 "Declare war on the Ottomans!"
egy.29.b:0 "We are not ready..."

egy.30.a:0 "We shall crush them!"

egy.32.t:0 "Arabian block declares war on the Ottomans!"
egy.32.d:0 "The recent uprising in Kurdistan is viewed as a sign that the days of the Ottoman Empire are numbered. This event was used by the armed forces of the Arabian bloc, which are steadily advancing into Ottoman territories. Now that the days of the Ottoman Empire are numbered, shall we finally realise our long-term plans and liberate our Shiite brethren or shall we wait for a better time?"
egy.32.a:0 "Declare war on the Ottomans!"
egy.32.b:0 "We are not ready..."
