The collapse of Federal authority on the islands has precipitated a new eminent influence from the Japanese Empire, which complicates future classification of Japanese residents. More liberal elements of the Hawaiian Republic wish to officially enfranchise Japanese residents as full citizens. The military elements, still attached to their exclusively white origins, have stated their position against Japanese citizenship. Thirdly the Japanese Empire itself has surprised us by asserting in telegrams that Japanese residents are still legally Japanese citizens. How do we respond?"

While the weapon situation is easy to remedy, the recruitment is still stifled. Governor Dole has come to the militias to propose that they face the political realities of the territory and drop their racial requirement. The militia leaders continue to refuse the advice, and the Governor has come to consider an alternative solution. Fire the leaders of the militias and appoint yes-men. This would reflect negatively on the status of white Hawaiians in general however."

This important tie to mainland United States has allowed for us to import bureaucrats and labor organizers to Hawaii in order to better achieve socialism. However, these last few months have shown some disunity between the longtime resident organizers and the newer arrivals. The new ministers are less than knowledgeable about agriculture and shipbuilding, and use their wages to import increasingly expensive goods from the mainland. This issue would be ignorable, if not for a growing resentment in the more egalitarian society we all are building. Several men and women have anonymously met to ask for "cozy desk jobs" as a reward for their months of patience in the new Commune. How do we respond?"
