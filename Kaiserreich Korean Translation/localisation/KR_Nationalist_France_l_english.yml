### Leader Descriptions ###
POLITICS_PHILIPPE_PETAIN_DESC:0 "베르됭의 사자는 북아프리카에서 지중해 건너 편의 사악한 생디칼리스트 쥐새끼들에게 거칠게 포효하는 것으로만 보이지만, 그는 조국 프랑스와 그가 가진 모든 것들이 무너지는 광경을 바라보며 가슴이 찢어질 듯한 슬픔에 울부짖었습니다. 그는 자신의 군대가 반란을 일으킬 것이라고는 꿈에도 몰랐고, 에펠 탑에 붉은 깃발이 게양되는 것도 전혀 예상치 못했으며, 자신이 낡은 증기선을 타고 프랑스에서 알제로 탈출하리라는 것도 예상치 못했습니다. 국민 프랑스는 옛 프랑스 공화국의 영광의 그림자에도 미치지 못하지만, 페텡 원수와 그의 조국에 사는 모든 이들의 가슴 속에는 여전히 무언가가 요동치고 있었고, 그것은 그들의 가라앉을 줄 모르는 복수심이었습니다. 베르됭의 사자는 자신의 몸이 북아프리카의 모래가 아닌 프랑스의 땅, 베르됭에 묻히는 것 외에는 바라는 것이 없습니다. 베르됭의 사자는 다시 뛰어들 것입니다. 이번에는 붉은 반역자들을 끝장내기 위해서!"
POLITICS_JEAN_III_DESC:0 "Jean III de Orléans, once the picture of aristocratic aloofness, was severely affected by the syndicalist revolution in France. As he fled to North Africa, he became convinced of the necessity of the monarchy in securing the future of the embattled France and its people. Working closely with Action Française, Jean presented himself as the champion of the people in the fight against syndicalism. With the restoration of the Orléans monarchy, Jean aims to destroy the Communards, and extend the monarchy's principled governance to all France."
POLITICS_NAPOLEON_IV_DESC:0 "Louis Napoleon IV de Bonaparte is the symbol of a France renewed. Coronated in the Notre Dame d'Afrique with the same grandiosity as the first Napoleon in Paris, he represents the ambition of the restoration of France's old glory. Like his ancestor at Austerlitz, Louis Napoleon endeavors to strike a deadly blow to the heart of France's enemies."
POLITICS_PIERRE_FLANDIN_DESC:0 "Pierre Etienne Flandin reminisces of the France that was before the turmoil of the Weltkrieg and revolution. A devotee of laissez faire economics and quite socially conservative, but also firmly republican, Flandin's vision of France's future is equally a vision of the past he so cherishes."
POLITICS_ANDRE_MALLARME_DESC:0 "André Mallarmé is often smeared by his political opponents as foolishly idealistic. Mallarmé embraces such criticisms; indeed, he is an idealist, but to be an idealist, Mallarmé argues, is to subscribe to the most worthy of notions: liberty, equality, and fraternity, the rallying cry of France's first republicans. Mallarmé believes that though syndicalism is an affront to human dignity, the concerns of France's people must be not only tolerated, but considered. A liberal republic, to Mallarmé, is the only effective defence against syndicalism."
POLITICS_FERNAND_BOUISSON_DESC:0 "Fernand Bouisson, a deputy from the 'Bouches du Rhone' before the Weltkrieg and a Pied-Noir, was well suited for the political atmosphere of the exiled French Republic. Bouisson, a leftist with a disdain for syndicalism did not hesitate to publicly disavow that ideology in an address before the chamber of deputies. Bouisson is guided compassion for his fellow man, and the belief that all French should have their needs met."
POLITICS_CHARLES_DEGAULLE_DESC:0 "Charles de Gaulle, who once fought furiously against both the Germans and Communards, now, as president, battles for the fate of the French Republic. A protégé of Philippe Petain, de Gaulle advocates a strong executive as the only institution capable of guiding the wayward Republic back to prominence. As a leader of men, both in the field of battle and in the halls of the legislature, de Gaulle has proven capable."
POLITICS_HENRI_VI_DESC:0 "Henri VI de Orléans, though but a boy when France was swept up in the fires of revolution, still bears a scar on his forearm where a stray piece of shrapnel embedded itself all those years ago. The trials Henri experienced in his youth steeled his resolve to dedicate himself to France; though paternalistic, Henri is deeply personally invested in his people's wellbeing. As king, Henri seeks to be both France's sword and its shield in the struggle for its future."

### Ideas ###
NFA_anti_communard:0 "반 코뮌"
NFA_anti_communard_desc:0 "1919년 세계대전에서 우리가 패배한 이후, 코뮌은 다시 봉기해 우리의 자랑스러운 공화국을 파괴했습니다. 다행히도, 공화국의 가장 중요한 인물들 중 몇몇은 반-혁명 계획을 세우고 있는 알제리로 피신했습니다. 생디칼리즘 반역자들이 본토를 완전히 장악했으니, 우리는 그들을 분쇄해야 합니다! 우리는 조국 영원한 프랑스의 영원한 자유를 보장할 것입니다!"
NFA_french_in_exile:0 "망명 프랑스"
NFA_french_in_exile_desc:0 "우리 식민지인 이곳에서 순수 프랑스계는 소수입니다. 우리는 유럽계만 징병하기 때문에, 몇 가지 인력 문제를 가지고 있습니다."
NFA_political_unrest:0 "정치적 불안정"
NFA_political_unrest_desc:0 "군사 정부의 최선의 노력에도 불구하고 제 4공화국 국민들의 불만이 높아지고 있습니다. 모리스 쟈냉 수상의 최근 정치적 실수 때문에 페탱 원수는 후임자를 찾아야 했습니다. 그러나 학자들은 그저 총리를 교체하는 것만으로는 국민들을 달래기에 충분하지 않을 것이라는 우려를 제기하고 있습니다. 많은 사람들은 이 불안정함이 프랑스의 미래에 대한 신호라고 믿습니다."

### Focuses ###
NFA_industrial_revival:0 "산업 확장"
NFA_industrial_revival_desc:0 "Our industry here in Africa is far behind the one the communards have on the mainland. If we want to defeat them we'll have to strengthen our industry significantly."
NFA_sahara_census:0 "사하라 인구 조사와 인구 목록 작성 시작"
NFA_sahara_census_desc:0 "The French Government-in-Exile has had a tough economic situation, leading to several outlandish projects in order to gain more funds. Some bright young mind in a government agency has come up with an idea to make a census and inventory of the Sahara region. We should send out government officials and expeditions to survey the region."
NFA_sahara_census_tooltip:0 "알제리-중앙 아프리카의 인구 조사와 인구 목록 작성을 시작할 것입니다... \n"
NFA_inventory_progress:0 "알제리-중앙 아프리카 인구 조사가 완료되었습니다."
NFA_transsaharian:0 "사하라 횡단 철도"
NFA_transsaharian_desc:0 "A key component of our strategy is to improve the links between North and West Africa, particularly with our base of Dakar. To solve that, the project of a railroad linking Algiers to Dakar directly was already started under the Third Republic but the project was ultimately abandoned, now it's our turn to take on this torch and succeed where our predecessors couldn't!"
building_transaharian_tooltip:0 "다카르와 알제를 연결하는 철도를 건설하기 시작할 것입니다\n"
NFA_develop_ALG:0 "도로부"
NFA_develop_ALG_desc:0 "Before thinking of enhancing our industrial output, we have to improve (and in some cases, create from scratch) the infrastructure of the Algerian departments. Unfortunately, they're not nearly as developed as we hoped they would be."
NFA_industrial_expansion_ALG:0 "통제 경제 정책"
NFA_industrial_expansion_ALG_desc:0 "Before our defeat against the red scum, Algeria was the most developed colony in our whole empire – but it was still a colony, one with low industrial capacity. The glaring lack of financial input has not made the situation better. We should sponsor state-run companies to alleviate this problem."
NFA_military_factories_ALG:0 "알제리 군수 산업"
NFA_military_factories_ALG_desc:0 "To reconquer our homeland we need to produce more weapons than the traitors against us. Funding new factories should help us reduce the difference between us and them."
NFA_more_military_factories_ALG:0 "금속산업 확장"
NFA_more_military_factories_ALG_desc:0 "The newly created mines and factories will allow us to build a grand metal industry designed to supply our army."
NFA_dakar_algiers_airway:0 "다카르-알제 항로"
NFA_dakar_algiers_airway_desc:0 "The Dakar to Algiers Airways was the brain child of Louis Breguet and was designed to kick start the economy in the south of the nation. The competition with German and South African businesses had been a problem for the struggling French businesses and Breguet wanted to help. He was hoping that a new airline could bring more business to North Africa."
NFA_expand_airway:0 "항로 확장"
NFA_expand_airway_desc:0 "The success of the DAA has led to Breguet wanting to expand it throughout Africa. Breguet wishes to expand in every direction, but we run the risk of the DAA stretching itself too thin. Should we do it anyway?"
NFA_improve_maritime_links:0 "항로 개선"
NFA_improve_maritime_links_desc:0 "The cohesion between our Algerian industry and West African holdings greatly relies on the quality of the infrastructure connecting the two parts. By expanding and improving the maritime links between them we can hope for a more efficient industrial base."
NFA_develop_mines:0 "새로운 광산 개통"
NFA_develop_mines_desc:0 "The first step in the exploitation of our West African holdings has proven successful. We should increase the number of mines and start building some basic metal refineries to support further development."
NFA_colonial_resources:0 "식민지 개발"
NFA_colonial_resources_desc:0 "If we want to fuel our industry we need resources. Thankfully, our West African holdings are full of iron, aluminium, and other metals! If we dig new mines and make people work for us (willingly or not) we could improve our finances and reduce our industry's reliance on foreign supplies!"
NFA_cotton_mali:0 "수단 목화"
NFA_cotton_mali_desc:0 "Recently a French engineer exiled in Africa has been pushing for a crazy idea to develop our colonies and make new profits. Emile Bélime assures that the valley of the Niger in French Sudan is an excellent place to grow cotton and to compete even with the biggest producers in the United States or Egypt. Despite our initial perplexity, we could try and give him the funds."
NFA_sahara:0 "사하라 석유 개발"
NFA_sahara_desc:0 "The Sahara is big and empty, but perhaps not as empty as we once thought? Plenty of Berber tribes live deep inside these territories where our reach does not fully extend. With traces of oil being found in the territory, the Sahara could be the solution to many of our problems if we exploit it!"
NFA_algerie_refinery:0 "알제리 정유공장"
NFA_algerie_refinery_desc:0 "The Saharan oil covers most of our needs but we could greatly increase our production with the development of refineries on the Mediterranean Coast."
NFA_extra_research_slot:0 "새로운 연구 시설"
NFA_extra_research_slot_desc:0 "Promising young minds are popping up everywhere. We need to supply them with facilities to conduct their research. Advances in technology can give us the edge we need to reconquer our homeland."

NFA_Darlan_Focus:0 "다를랑 계획"
NFA_Darlan_Focus_desc:0 "The General Strategy of the French State will follow the advice of Admiral Darlan, focusing on defending our holdings from possible threats, instead of recklessly risking our forces on enemy lands."
NFA_fortification_focus:0 "요새 표준화"
NFA_fortification_focus_desc:0 "It is imperative that was are not surprised by enemy landings. If we want to defend our holdings better, it would be wise to standardise fortification designs to reduce construction times. The quicker we have our fortifications up, the better."
NFA_mediteranean_forts:0 "해안 방어"
NFA_mediteranean_forts_desc:0 "The most important task of our industry is to heavily fortify the Mediterranean coast so as to create a fortress safe from the Communards and their lackeys!"
NFA_protect_the_air:0 "영공 방어"
NFA_protect_the_air_desc:0 "Our coastal fortifications will be worthless if the sky is controlled by our enemies, our forces harassed by their aerial attacks and our industries reduced to shambles."
NFA_radar_effort:0 "레이더 기술 개발"
NFA_radar_effort_desc:0 "The latest technology in detection is the so called RADAR. If we set up radars along the African North coast we could detect any invasion across the Mediterranean while it was still in the planning phase!"
NFA_aviation_home_defense:0 "군용기 : 국토 방위 집중"
NFA_aviation_home_defense_desc:0 "Air warfare in desert areas is quite different from air warfare on the European continent. We must take every detail into consideration when designing our air force."
NFA_cas_effort:0 "근접지원항공기 개발"
NFA_cas_effort_desc:0 "With no place to hide in the open plains of North Africa, infantry and even armour units are very exposed to aerial attacks. Close air supports with sow and reap death in any enemy formation!"
NFA_navy_expansion:0 "프랑스 해군 확장"
NFA_navy_expansion_desc:0 "We must not let our enemies come close to our coasts and threaten our haven : the French Navy must be enlarged and our hold on the sea secured!"
NFA_navy_expansion_tooltip:0 "This Focus will unlock events freely giving new ships. \n"
NFA_dockyard_focus:0 "다카르 조선소 확장"
NFA_dockyard_focus_desc:0 "We needed to build from scratch naval dockyards following the loss of France. Dakar was chosen to host our submarine bases and we feel it needs to be enlarged so that we can compete with our enemies in the Mediterranean."
NFA_naval_doctrine:0 "새로운 전술 연구"
NFA_naval_doctrine_desc:0 "Darlan has sent some of his brightest officers abroad, to Japan and Canada, to study the latest expertise on naval warfare."
NFA_destroyer_focus:0 "구축함 집중"
NFA_destroyer_focus_desc:0 "While great battleships might have been preferable, it is sadly unrealistic to attempt to construct these with our current industrial capacity. Modern destroyers are better suited to our needs."
NFA_light_cruiser_focus:0 "경순양함 집중"
NFA_light_cruiser_focus_desc:0 "Light Cruisers should make up the core of our modern, specialised fleet. They are not expensive to construct but can, despite their weight, deliver heavy damage to enemy ships and planes alike."
NFA_heavy_cruiser_focus:0 "중순양함 집중"
NFA_heavy_cruiser_focus_desc:0 "Heavy cruisers are key ships in any potent fleet meant to dominate an ocean. If we can focus our war industry well enough we should be able to produce a large enough number of these deadly vessels to control our home seas."
NFA_battleship_focus:0 "전함 집중"
NFA_battleship_focus_desc:0 "To defeat our enemies we will have to destroy them in decisive fights. What better weapons than battleships to win this fight?"

NFA_DeGaulle_focus:0 "드골 계획"
NFA_DeGaulle_focus_desc:0 "The Military High-Command will follow the recommendations of Général de Gaulle, focusing on building our military forces to retake our homeland."
NFA_southern_conscription:0 "남부 징집"
NFA_southern_conscription_desc:0 "Nationalist France had been struggling with manpower. The reputation of the French military had been tarnished by its failure in the Weltkrieg and volunteering was at an all time low. Fiercely national Frenchman could not be the only source of manpower and other sources of manpower were needed. The government is looking to the people in the south of the country."
NFA_native_conscription:0 "원주민 징집"
NFA_native_conscription_desc:0 "The easiest way to increase the number of available men is to conscript the local men into our army and make them fight for us. It was a solution that the High-Command was reluctant to implement because of the risk of sedition from these new units."
NFA_native_conscription_tooltip:0 "2개의 기병 사단을 콘스탄틴에서 획득하고 4개의 보병 사단을 프랑스령 수단에서 획득할 것입니다. \n"
NFA_continue_native_conscription:0 "원주민 징집 지속"
NFA_continue_native_conscription_desc:0 "While recruitment from the Northern provinces was met with resistance from the parliament, we still do not have enough men. We could extend conscription to the south, not only relying on the Arabs but also the Sub-Saharan Africans. It should grant us sorely needed manpower, but it will require a lot of political effort to pull through."
NFA_native_conscription2_tooltip:0 "1개의 기병 사단을 콘스탄틴에서 획득하고 5개의 보병 사단을 프랑스령 수단에서 획득할 것입니다. \n"
NFA_legionary_campaign:0 "외인부대 강화"
NFA_legionary_campaign_desc:0 "To increase our armed forces we could increase the size of the Légion Étrangère. Hosting the valorous anti-syndicalist fighters from around the world our Army could become the bane of the Red Hydra!"

NFA_continue_legionary_campaign:0 "신병 모집 운동 확장"

NFA_aviation_invasion:0 "군용기 : 침공 집중"

NFA_aviation_doctrine:0 "신세대 장교"
NFA_aviation_doctrine_desc:0 "The so called Young Guards, able and blooming young men of France, have many revolutionary ideas for how to conduct warfare."
NFA_naval_bomber_focus:0 "공중에서 바다 통제"
NFA_naval_bomber_focus_desc:0 "While we may be unable to afford constructing a fleet able to rival that of our enemies, we can design naval bombers able to control the Mediterranean for long enough to initiate a landing in our home lands."
NFA_paratrooper_focus:0 "공수부대 설립"
NFA_paratrooper_focus_desc:0 "The Young Guards have presented us with a new, daring idea. Lightly supported infantry could be dropped from planes behind enemy lines and cut off tactically important locations."
NFA_invasion_navy:0 "침공특화 해군"
NFA_invasion_navy_desc:0 "Our navy is badly outdated and could, at best, prevent the Reds from landing in North Africa. We need to control the sea if we wish to perform a successful invasion of southern France."
NFA_naval_invasion_focus:0 "해방선 (The Vaisseaux de la Libération)"
NFA_naval_invasion_focus_desc:0 "We cannot be satisfied with simply a navy able to do battle. We also need a large convoy fleet, able to feed our armies once we start liberating southern France."
NFA_battleship_focus_degaulle:0 "전함 주력"
NFA_battleship_focus_degaulle_desc:0 "Battleships may be expensive, but no one can deny the important role they play in naval warfare, and in amphibious landings. Their large guns can hammer any local resistance to dust before the marines even reach the beach!"
NFA_submarine_focus:0 "잠수함 주력"
NFA_submarine_focus_desc:0 "Submarines are cheap and work excellently to both escort and intercept convoy lanes."
NFA_carrier_effort:0 "항공모함 개발"
NFA_carrier_effort_desc:0 "Carriers are expensive and massive naval projects to undertake... But should we manage to construct a few and protect them with screens, our navy will go from an outdated relic of the past to one of the most feared ones the world knows."

NFA_restore_constitution:0 "유예된 헌법 복원"
NFA_restore_constitution_desc:0 "제3공화국은 그 전신과 마찬가지로, 독일에게 패배해 종식되었습니다. 코뮌 봉기와 아프리카로의 도피 이후, 조프르와 후에는 페탱에 의해 헌법은 효력이 일시중지 되었습니다. 아마도 이제는 군정을 끝내고 프랑스 민주주의의 진정한 이상으로 개혁할 때일지도 모릅니다."

NFA_judiciary_frenchmen:0 "식민지 의회"
NFA_judiciary_frenchmen_desc:0 "The Constitution of the Fourth French Republic had envisioned an independent High-Court but it was never implemented. We should reaffirm that French and colonised are not equal before the law by confirming the existence of colonial courts for the locals."

NFA_extended_suffrage_desc:0 "The upcoming elections require us to delimit who will be able to vote. Traditionally the colonised could not vote, leaving the Algerian assembly dominated by the Pied-Noirs minority.

NFA_limited_suffrage:0 "피에 누아르 참정권"

While we still have important power over him, his symbolic authority is strong and the Bey is loved and respected amongst the population.

The injured have been transported to the hospital quickly but the population is shocked. This is the first terror attack of the radicalised Algerian nationalists, they claim that Constantine was legitimate to be striked first due to being the centre of the repression against their brothers during the protests. More moderate elements condemned this attack but it didn't prevent the growing resentment of the Pied-Noirs against the Algerians, terrorists or not.

nfa.123.d:0 "Habous properties are, in North Africa, properties protected by Islamic law to be irrevocable and which is supposed to be used for Islamic charity. Conflicts between the colonial government and the natives over these, the government seeing it as an obstacle for the development of the country, have always existed but had lead to compromises. When in Tunisia private habous weren't touched and public habous were put to location under a bid system called the 'enzel', in Algeria public habous were regularly seized by the government following its need but here too private habous were untouched. But despite this status several habous properties in the region of Algiers and Bône are blocking off the ambitious industrialisation plans of the government, unable to sell them due to Islamic law the only other possibility would be to seize them by force. This would surely anger some people but it would help greatly our industry in the region."
nfa.123.a:0 "Do it."
nfa.123.b:0 "Leave them alone"
nfa.124.t:0 "The Ulemas protest!"
nfa.124.d:0 "Some of the most famous Islamic scholars known as ulemas protested against our decision to seize private habous properties as it's seen as a direct attack against the religion of Islam. Ulemas have a great deal of political influence in Algeria and will surely lead other people to think the same."
nfa.124.a:0 "Whatever"
nfa.125.t:0 "The Start of the Transsaharian"
nfa.125.d:0 "The construction of the Transsaharian railroad between Algiers and Dakar will start today, the first part will be built between north-western Algeria and Colomb-Béchar and then the rail will continue across the Mauritanian desert, passing through St-Louis to finally reach Dakar. This morning the president is awaited to give the first pickaxe stroke of the railways and the work will be uninterrupted for months, or even years. We of course hope everything will go well."
nfa.125.a:0 "Good luck!"
nfa.126.t:0 "The Transsaharian is achieved!"
nfa.126.d:0 "Finally after so long, and so many efforts, the monumental achievement that is the Transsaharian railway is achieved. Magnificent rails run from North to South across the desert and displays the best of the French engineering, even exiled in Africa the French genius never dies. This connection is expected to kickstart the economy on both sides by giving an faster path for the African resources to be brought in the Algerian factories and to symbolically bring together the two parts of National France so that they may never break apart."
nfa.126.a:0 "Hourrah!"
nfa.127.t:0 "The Transsaharian progresses"
nfa.127.d:0 "Great progress has been made on the Transsaharian lately due to the braveness of our workers and the expertise of our engineers, Dakar gets closer."
nfa.127.a:0 "Very good."
nfa.128.t:0 "Which workers for the railroad?"
nfa.128.d:0 "Now that we symbolically started the construction of the railroad we have to ask ourselves which type of workforce we want to use in majority for this project. We could bring in skilled workers from Algeria, either Pied-Noirs or skilled natives, surely they will be very efficient but they will also be very costly in wages and maintenance, building houses and giving them enough food and protection won't be free. Alternatively we could use a more volatile force of volunteers from Algeria or from bordering countries, usually poor people looking for a job, these workers won't be as efficient as their skilled counterparts but offer the advantage of being easier to please and of not complaining as much. Finally there is the possibility of forcefully bringing in labourforce from our colonies in Black Africa, they obviously have the advantage of not costing anything and of being 'satisfied' with very poor working conditions, they are also a disposable workforce as if some disappear, we can just bring more; the drawback of this choice is that they also are neither efficient or motivated for their job."
nfa.128.a:0 "Use well-paid skill workers"
nfa.128.b:0 "Use underpaid volunteers, from Algeria or beyond!"
nfa.128.c:0 "Force the natives in West Africa to work for us!"
nfa.129.t:0 "Sandstorm!"
nfa.129.d:0 "A violent sandstorm broke out in the middle of the desert during the construction of the railroad. Not happy of seriously delaying the construction, the sandstorm also damaged several temporary houses and made us lost some tools. Consequently the construction has been delayed."
nfa.129.a:0 "The construction takes a hit."
nfa.130.t:0 "A River on the Path"
nfa.130.d:0 "During the planning phase of the project rivers were carefully noted and marked on a map and the construction planned for it in advance but upon seeing this river, something was wrong. It was way higer than normal! Our engineers and geographers didn't take into account the potential rise of the water and we are now stuck with a river we can't cross for now. We'll have to wait for better equipment."
nfa.130.a:0 "Not a problem for our talented workers."
nfa.130.b:0 "That will surely slow down the process."
nfa.130.c:0 "We didn't plan for this!"
nfa.131.t:0 "The workers complain of their working conditions"
nfa.131.d:0 "Disaster on the construction of the railway! The labourforce stopped working and are complaining of their 'terrible' working conditions, would it be their accommodation, malaria or the direction of the works that they think is too harsh. They are saying they won't start the work again until their conditions are improved, but they will surely get to work again one day if we just ignore it."
nfa.131.a:0 "Agree to their demands."
nfa.131.b:0 "Let them shout!"
nfa.132.t:0 "The project is lacking workers"
nfa.132.d:0 "The reputation of the construction of the railways is well-known throughout our neighbours, the working conditions in the desert and under brutal directors are terrible and the wages aren't worth it. We are consequently having more and more problems recruiting workers as no one wants to go to this hell. This problem has to be solved for the construction to continue properly, we could make an effort to improve their conditions slightly and recruit more people or we could bet on a temporary scare that we can ignore, thirdly we could scrap this recruiting project and start recruiting Africans... with our own ways."
nfa.132.a:0 "Make an effort to recruit more."
nfa.132.b:0 "It will surely go better one day."
nfa.132.c:0 "Enough! Switch to African workers!"
nfa.133.t:0 "Our workers are decimated!"
nfa.133.d:0 "A massacre. There is no other word to describe what is happening during this construction. The foremen are mercilessly beating up the workers when they judge they aren't doing enough, hundreds are dying of exhaustion, malaria, or under the beatings of the managers, the labourforce is totally demoralised and we are now lacking people to finish the railway. Our forced recruitment in African villages isn't even working anymore, people are doing anything to avoid being recruited. Should we make our recruitment policies harsher or should we wait until all is forgotten?"
nfa.133.a:0 "Throw more men at the problem!"
nfa.133.b:0 "It will surely go better one day."
nfa.134.t:0 "Leaflets in the street"
nfa.134.d:0 "'Tunisia is a free nation!', this is the odious statement written on one of the leaflet found in the largest arteries of Tunis today, all signed by the nationalist party Destour. Hundreds of them have been dispersed through the capital and removed as quickly as possible by the French authorities. Their influence on the Tunisian people has surely been minimal due to their quick removal but it still shows a significant revival of Tunisian nationalism which we thought was reduced to small inactive groups of the countryside after our action against them in the 20's. \nThe fact that they didn't fear anything by leaving these leaflets show, more than their arrogance, that they gained a level of passive agreement with either the population or the official authorities of the Protectorate. This conclusion quickly led us to investigate the links of the Bey with these groups and we find some small parts and testimonies that, while not enough to depose the Bey altogether, are enough to confront him about this treason. Should we try to confront him or let the matter drop?"
nfa.134.a:0 "Confront the Bey"
nfa.134.b:0 "Ignore this... for now"
nfa.135.t:0 "The Bey's response"
nfa.135.d:0 "The Bey answered to the concerns brought by our Resident-General by assuring that never would he fund or facilitate the action of these 'fighters' according to his own words. He found it shocking that we could even accuse him of it but, he has said, is willing to forget about that if we are ready to consider him better. Many in our administration is doubting these claims as the Bey never hid his nationalist tendencies but some think he wouldn't endanger his throne by funding terrorists and that he must be honest. Which side are we on?"
nfa.135.a:0 "Trust him..."
nfa.135.b:0 "He is decieving us, warn him for his actions"
nfa.136.t:0 "Tunisian Unions"
nfa.136.d:0 "The creation of the first Tunisian unions date back to the awakening of Tunisian nationalism in the 20's before the ban on unions applied in Algeria was applied in Tunisia too. These unions, led by Mohammed Ali Hammi knew the same fate than the nationalit leaders and were heavily repressed and dismantled while Hammi died in prison in 1934. We thought this would forever be the end of Tunisian trade unionism until we heard of clandestine trade unions reappearing in their bastion of Sfax in the south of Tunisia and slowly spreading amongst immigrants of the south in northern cities. The main representative of these new unions is named 'General Association of the Tunisian Workers' and is led by Tahar Haddad, known for being a nationalist and therefore uniting two of our greatest enemies. \nIt's obvious that this corrupt organisation must be taken down, what if it was helped by Communard spies and agitators? Something surprising though is that the Tunisian authorities didn't already strike on them, they usually know about these sorts of events before us. This bizarre fact boosted the doubts on the Bey again and some of high-ranking officials want to ask him to crackdown on the unionists himself to see if he is being honest or not. What should we do?"
nfa.136.a:0 "Crackdown on them ourselves!"
nfa.136.b:0 "Ask the Bey to make it stop."
nfa.136.c:0 "Ignore it."
nfa.137.t:0 "The Bey's response"
nfa.137.d:0 "The Bey, confronted by our Resident-General refused to crackdown on the unions, citing a 'lack of proofs' and 'only rumours'. This indifference greatly angered the most high-ranking representatives of France in Tunisia and calls for an increased pressure on the Bey have arisen. This anyway won't prevent us to destroy these unions ourselves."
nfa.137.a:0 "Warn the Bey about his obedience and crackdown on the unions!"
nfa.137.b:0 "This was the last warning, ask him to step down."
nfa.137.c:0 "Back down..."
nfa.138.t:0 "The Bey's response"
nfa.138.d:0 "Great News! The Bey isn't as corrupt by the nationalist ideology as we thought and agreed to repress the unions, he seemed visibly angered of it happening on his territory and this makes us hope for a more constructive relationship in the future."
nfa.138.a:0 "Good."
nfa.139.t:0 "The Bey steps down!"
nfa.139.d:0 "Surprisingly the Bey agreed to step down and leave the place to his relative Lamine Bey, he accepted his political defeat and stepped down to, he says, spare a bloodshed that would have hurt the Tunisian people. Though, he obtained to be treated with all the honours a former Bey should receive."
nfa.139.a:0 "Long live Lamine Bey!"
nfa.140.t:0 "The Bey refuses to step down"
nfa.140.d:0 "The Bey was shocked by our demand and refused to step down as the monarch of Tunisia citing his right to govern that was given by its people and Allah himself. Seeing it as a direct agression he called all the Tunisians to arm and mobilised what he could of nationalist militias he had links to drive out the French from Tunisia forever. While we are reporting this, the Beylical Guard is fighting fiercefully with the French garrison in Tunis."
nfa.140.a:0 "Is it a revolt?"
nfa.141.t:0 "The dockers's strike"
nfa.141.d:0 "The dockers of the port of Tunis, mainly coming from the south of Tunisia, bastion of the the unions, striked today, claiming better wages and working conditions. This subsersive demonstration and opening to syndicalist agitators is unacceptable and must be stopped at all costs but we have two options to deal with them. We could send the army and do it by force, potentially angering the Tunisians and destroying industrial assets in the fight or we could negotiate better conditions with them, this would surely stop the strike but it would be a huge thorn in our pride and the elite circles of Algeria would greatly disapprove this policy."
nfa.141.a:0 "Send the army."
nfa.141.b:0 "Negotiate with them"
nfa.142.t:0 "The great Tunisian protest"
nfa.142.d:0 "Habib Bourguiba. One of the rising leaders of the renewed nationalist movement that we spied on for a while, gathering intel about his doings and the networks he is linked to. He comes from the second generation of the Destour, an educated elite that fell in nationalism and that revived the national movement. Well, he is now at the head of the cortege of the protest that took off in Tunis today. Rassembling numerous nationalist leaders, from small subversive groups to clandestine unions and benefiting from our lenient policy they managed to rally hundreds of people to their cause and are now protesting as a provocation in the middle of Tunis! \nAgain the behaviour of the Bey was strange, how come he didn't even hear about this when his servants tell him anything about what happens in the city? He is suspect but he helped us before, could we give him our confidence? \nThis was anyway a fool move from the nationalist forces as they will be crused by our repression."
nfa.142.a:0 "Crackdown on it ourselves."
nfa.142.b:0 "Ask the Bey to make it stop!"
nfa.142.c:0 "Just ignore it."
nfa.143.t:0 "The Bey's response"
nfa.143.d:0 "The Bey, confronted by our Resident-General refused to crackdown on the protest, he refused to give the order to fire on Tunisian civilians, as illegal as the protest might be. This refusal greatly angered the most high-ranking representatives of France in Tunisia and calls for an increased pressure on the Bey have arisen. This anyway won't prevent us to destroy this movement ourselves."
nfa.143.a:0 "Warn the Bey about his obedience and crackdown on the protest!"
nfa.143.b:0 "This was the last warning, ask him to step down."
nfa.143.c:0 "Back down..."
nfa.144.t:0 "The Bey's response"
nfa.144.d:0 "Great News! The Bey isn't as corrupt by the nationalist ideology as we thought and agreed to repress the protest, he seemed visibly angered of it happening in his capital and this makes us hope for a more constructive relationship in the future."
nfa.144.a:0 "Good."
nfa.145.t:0 "Incident in Tunisia"
nfa.145.d:0 "An incident between the French authorities and Tunisians occured today, a disagreement over the respect of a law led to an increased tension that degenerated in a street fight. The Tunisian was probably fuelled by nationalist sentiments that are slowly spreading through the population."
nfa.145.a:0 "Unfortunate"
nfa.146.t:0 "National France beat us!" #White peace ai event
nfa.146.d:0 "You're not supposed to see that event, please report it if you do."
nfa.146.a:0 "Go back to our desert"
nfa.147.t:0 "Tunisia is victorious!"
nfa.147.d:0 "The damn Tunisians who rose up against our regime have managed to push back our armies and are now dangerously threatening our hold on North Africa. Our defeat is unquestionable, it may be time to ask for peace, a shameful as it is."
nfa.147.a:0 "Ask to meet the Bey for peace."
nfa.147.b:0 "We'll never surrender to colonials!"
nfa.148.t:0 "Tunisia is victorious!"
nfa.148.d:0 "The glorious lead of Moncef Bey was successful and the French are now crawling to our feet for peace. Will we be magnanimous and settle for the entire liberation of the Protectorate or should we destroy them completely?"
nfa.148.a:0 "We accept their offer."
nfa.148.b:0 "The French shall be destroyed entirely."
nfa.149.t:0 "Tunisia accepted our offer"
nfa.149.d:0 "The Bey accepted our gracious offer for the liberation of the Tunisian protectorate and we now have to make this agreement effective."
nfa.149.a:0 "Shame devours France."
nfa.150.t:0 "French invasion of Morocco!"
nfa.150.d:0 "Following the collapse of the once great German Empire, and our newfound independence, the French in Africa have taken it upon themselves to demand from us our territory, or risk facing war. What say we?"
nfa.150.a:0 "We've no choice but to surrender..."
nfa.150.b:0 "We shall fight to the end!"
nfa.151.t:0 "The Moroccans have resisted!"
nfa.151.d:0 "Foolishly, it seems as though the Moroccans have decided to snub our demands and will not be giving us our rightful territory. This is an act of aggression against France, and must surely be dealt with at once."
nfa.151.a:0 "Unfortunately, we are not yet ready for war..."
nfa.151.b:0 "It is time to attack!"
nfa.152.t:0 "The Return of Haute-Savoie"
nfa.152.d:0 "In the violence and confusion that followed our retreat to Africa, French land in Haute-Savoie had fallen under the protection of the Swiss government. Now that we have returned, it is time to consider re-establishing our territorial integrity and demand the return of these French posessions."
nfa.152.a:0 "Demand Haute-Savoie returned"
nfa.152.b:0 "We have more pressing concerns"
nfa.153.t:0 "France Demands Haute-Savoie"
nfa.153.d:0 "A point of contention between the Commune of France and us has always been the fate of Haute-Savoie. We took control of the region in order to protect it's mandated neutrality during the reign of the Syndacalists in Paris. Now that the legitimate government has returned and is demanding its return, now may be time to relinquish our control."
nfa.153.a:0 "France will have Haute-Savoie"
nfa.153.b:0 "We can't risk angering the government in Paris"
nfa.153.c:0 "Haute-Savoie will remain in our posession"
nfa.154.t:0 "Switzerland refuses our demand!"
nfa.154.d:0 "By all rights Haute-Savoie is French. Whatever reasons the Swiss have for rejecting our demands are without merit. We must decide how to respond to this assault."
nfa.154.a:0 "Perhaps Switzerland should keep it"
nfa.154.b:0 "Sever Diplomatic ties and embargo them"
nfa.154.c:0 "To war!"
nfa.155.t:0 "Joining the legitimate French government"
nfa.155.d:0 "Our recent liberation from our oppressive overlord raises the question of the goal of the existence of our country. Started as a satellite in an occupied France, we now have full power over our land but not much use for it. Near us lays the National government of France that descends from the legitimate government of the Third Republic and claims ownership of our controlled territory. A lot of our citizens also look forward to this other government and do not understand why we are making a satellite state last. Should we join with National France or should we declare ourself a legitimate authority on the region?"
nfa.155.a:0 "Ask National France for an union of our states"
nfa.155.b:0 "We are the only legitimate power in France"
nfa.156.t:0 "The French meet the French"
nfa.156.d:0 "The former French puppet government in Paris has been recently liberated and, following a new foreign policy, decided to consider us the rightful French government and ask for an union of our authorities. We are obviously very happy to hear that and hope Frenchmen will continue rallying together."
