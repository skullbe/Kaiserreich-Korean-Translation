combinedsyndicates.2.e:0 "Let us move the capital to Philadelphia instead!"
combinedsyndicates.3.d:0 "The civil war had caused great damage throughout the country and there was much that needed to be done to ensure that the US would be great again. Reed believed that a strong industrial base would not only help the country rebuild but also help with unemployment. The rebuilding of the country would not be easy and would require a great deal of planning."
combinedsyndicates.3.a:0 "5 Year Plan"
combinedsyndicates.3.b:0 "3 Year Plan"
combinedsyndicates.3.c:0 "1 Year Plan"
combinedsyndicates.4.t:0 "Land and agricultural reforms"
combinedsyndicates.4.d:0 "Land and agricultural reforms were a hot button issue for the Syndicates. Would they implement a harsh program of collectivisation administered directly by the central government? Or would they allow for local syndicates to manage farmers? Another proposal would allow for farmers to have some guaranteed prices and also allow limited market involvement."
combinedsyndicates.4.a:0 "Start the Collectivisation process."
combinedsyndicates.4.b:0 "Let farming be run by local syndicates."

combinedsyndicates.10.t:0 "Reed and the PSA Leadership"
combinedsyndicates.10.d:0 "After the end of the civil war, the question of the PSA leadership was put before the CSA. The capitalist nature of the Pacific States was incompatible with the socialist nature of the CSA but it was also the thing that kept California one of the most technically adept places in America. Destroying the PSA leadership would destroy this but ensure that Reed would have full control of the industry on the West Coast."

combinedsyndicates.10.b:0 "We need them"
combinedsyndicates.11.t:0 "US Government in Exile"
combinedsyndicates.11.d:0 "The victory of the workers over the US government has forced them to flee from the country to Canada. The government has vowed to keep on fighting but without a firm power base there is very little chance of them making a difference."

combinedsyndicates.13.d:0 "The shooting had barely started when the CSA began to disintegrate. The loose coalition of socialists began to form sides. The Totalists began to form a government in Washington and were trying to exert their authority over the country. The Syndicalists were working with the trade unions to form local councils to run the recently conquered areas and were trying to buck the central authority.

combinedsyndicates.15.t:0 "The Southern Resistance"
combinedsyndicates.15.d:0 "The Socialists had brought about an immediate end to the racial segregation laws in the south. This caused an immediate flare up of racial tensions and violence. Throughout the South remnants of Long's Minutemen have formed a pact with the KKK to oppose us and the revolution. They terrorise the local countryside and were reportedly responsible for more than one lynching."
combinedsyndicates.15.a:0 "Blasted Reactionaries"
combinedsyndicates.16.t:0 "Violence throughout the South"
combinedsyndicates.16.d:0 "The racial tension that had been at the boiling point, boiled over, and erupted into violence. Groups of whites and blacks attacked each other as the local councils were unable to contain the issue. Tensions ran high as the South began to burn. Revolutionaries are demanding that we bring in more soldiers to the south."
combinedsyndicates.16.a:0 "Damn Reactionaries"

combinedsyndicates.17.d:0 "With the People's Liberation Army in place throughout the south helping to set up and bring the revolution to the south, Peace and Order has finally come to the South. The revolutionary ideals of equality for everyone in America can now come even to the South."

combinedsyndicates.19.t:0 "Jack Reed's Illness"
combinedsyndicates.19.d:0 "The physical health of the Head of the Central Committee, Jack Reed, has been deteriorating for a while now, to the point that a public announcement has had to be made concerning it, as it can no longer be concealed. The exact cause of his illness is currently unknown, but the wasting effects of it are shortening his life. Whilst his passion for the revolution remains untempered, his ability to lead it may not last much longer."
combinedsyndicates.19.a:0 "How dreadful"
combinedsyndicates.20.t:0 "Jack Reed passes away"
combinedsyndicates.20.d:0 "At 23:14 the Head of the Central Committee, Jack Reed, after valiantly fighting for his life and his country, and having managed to live to see his dream of a Syndicalist America, has passed away.

combinedsyndicates.21.t:0 "Second Constitutional Convention"
combinedsyndicates.21.d:0 "The time is here and all the delegates from across the country have arrived in Philadelphia to debate the future of America now that the revolution is won. Rather quickly numerous factions have formed from the various delegates. The Centralists seek to form a strong centralised government. The Unionists seek to establish a decentralised confederation with the power coming from the bottom up. With the Federalists in the middle seeking a balanced approach in terms of how the government should be structured."
combinedsyndicates.21.a:0 "Welcome Everyone!"
combinedsyndicates.22.t:0 "The New Republic's Structure"
combinedsyndicates.22.d:0 "The first day of debates have resulted in three plans to set up the government. The first is put forth by William Z. Foster which posits that there should be a centralised congress with the states having little to no power. This drew immediate ire from the Unionists which countered with their own plan based around decentralised power. A delegate from the Federalists stepped forward with a third plan that tries to be a balanced though both argue it is not revolutionary enough and is just the old US government with a new name."

combinedsyndicates.301.d:0 "The civil war in America is over and news has reached the Vatican about the rise of the Catholic Workers Movement. The movement is emphatically catholic but it is also emphatically an anarchist movement. The growth of the Catholic Workers Movement is concerning to the Vatican leadership who view it as a deviating it from Catholic Doctrine. However despite this, most think that the best way to handle it is to ignore it as most pious Catholics will stay true to the Church's teachings. While others think that an Encyclical against the movement would destroy it in the crib. While finally a small few think supporting the movement can allow the Catholic Church to turn it away from Syndicalism and as a force for good."

combinedsyndicates.305.t:0 "Primer of God Save the Kaiser"
combinedsyndicates.305.d:0 "With Reconstruction on the way Charlie Chaplin and the United Artist Union have released yet another hit. His new movie, God Save the Kaiser, is considered by man to be his best movie to date. God Save the Kaiser is a political satirical comedy-drama and Chaplin's first true sound films. The film follows two principal characters, an unnamed German barber struggling to make ends meet in Germany who bears a great deal of similarity with the Tramp that Chaplin played in his other movies. The other major character is Kaiser Fredrick who is a bumbling but cruel buffoon of a leader; an obvious satire of Kaiser Wilhelm the 2nd. Throughout the film it shows the plight of the average German worker while viciously mocking the German government and the kaiser in particular. The Film ends with the barber being mistaken for Kaiser and giving a rousing speech where he extols the virtues of Good will and Human Brotherhood and gives a strong endorsement for Chaplin's Radical Socialist views."
