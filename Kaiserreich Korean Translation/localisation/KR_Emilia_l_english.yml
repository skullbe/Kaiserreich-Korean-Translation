emi.1.d:0 "생디칼리스트들의 폭정과 그에 따른 악폐의 시대가 끝나고 우리 공국이 재건됨에 따라, 시민군들을 정규군으로 재조직하려는 우리의 노력은 비로소 성과를 거두었습니다. 누구도 다시는 우리 에밀리아인들을 노예로 만들 수 없습니다!"
emi.1.a:0 "만세!"
emi.2.t:0 "아펜니니"
emi.2.d:0 "The rough terrain of much of our homeland is irregular and often confusing to outsiders and may well be our best defence against a larger invading force. Old Partisan veterans from the war against the SRI have come together and formed our very own mountaineer regiments, the Appennini, who will dutifully defend our western borders"
emi.2.a:0 "으뜸 중 으뜸!"
emi.3.t:0 "잃어버린 길"
emi.3.d:0 "우리의 오래된 특산물들 중 많은 것들이 생디칼리스트 야만인들에 의해 몰락했습니다. 특히 영향을 받은 것은 치즈와 와인 제조업자들이었는데, 그들의 일터 상당수가 그들의 생산품을 퇴폐적이라고 주장하던 '미래주의자'들에 의해 파괴되었습니다. 우리는 우리 문화의 이 중요한 요소들을 재건하는 데 최선의 도움을 주어야만 합니다."
emi.3.a:0 "우리의 전통을 보존하기 위해 노력해야만 한다!"
emi.4.t:0 "엔초 페라리의 인기가 높아지다"
emi.4.d:0 "A chief captain of industry and community leader, Enzo Ferrari has done much since he arrived after the end of occupation from Syndicalists. Sensing opportunity, but also a genuine desire to help his home rebuild, his efforts to develop Modena are nothing short of remarkable, and he surely will be a political force in our Duchy in the future"
emi.4.a:0 "그는 현대 모데나의 상징이다."
emi.5.t:0 "대공과 그의 백성들"
emi.5.d:0 "As the years go by, Roberto more and more grows accustomed to his role as Duke and as the leader of his people. Having embraced his role as the first citizen of Emilia, Duke of Modena and all that entails, his outlook on things seems to be more trusting and relaxed than during his early years, when he was afraid of the land who rejected him after the Weltkrieg. Now he finds himself speaking Italian confidently, and ever more frequently, as so do his kids and household. His popularity rises as he continually tries to appear publically in the streets of Modena, and seems genuinely interested in the nation he was born to rule"
emi.5.a:0 "그렇게 되리라."
emi.6.t:0 "에밀리아어 사전이 편찬되다!"
emi.6.d:0 "The University of Parma has just yesterday published the first formal dictionary of the Emilian Language, cataloguing centuries of cultural and national legacy of our duchy which almost was trampled by Savoyard and Syndicalist ambitions. While its a long ways from replacing Standard Italian among many common people, a revival of the language may now begin starting with out youth"
emi.6.a:0 "대단하군!"
emi.7.t:0 "Fierce debate at the Academy"
emi.7.d:0 "Our status as being home to one of europe's finest military academies means that we often have visitors from abroad, bringing with them ideas and concepts, but also often strong opinions. Inevitably large debates emerge, especially now that the Duke has chosen one way to prioritze our army doctrine over other possible views. The topic of this choice has long dominated the academy classrooms and hallways and is sure to bring improvements"
emi.7.a:0 "Many great minds at work."
emi.8.t:0 "Barilla's Factories back at full capacity!"
emi.8.d:0 "As our program to get foodstuff factories up and running is now at full steam, Barilla's pasta factories finally are back at full capacity, after severe vandalism by 'futurist' thugs under SRI occupation. Despite the intial despair of the owners upon seeing what was left of the building a year ago, we finally have one of our premiere industries back on track"
emi.8.a:0 "무솔리니는 결국 우릴 막지 못했다!"
emi.9.t:0 "공작의 결혼식"
emi.9.d:0 "Duke Roberto has today married in the Modena Cathedral princess Margherita of Sardinia, a long agreed match between the two families that was postponed for many years of this cruel war in Italy.
