### Leader Descriptions ###
POLITICS_STERNBERG_DESC:0 "Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, the 'Mad Baron', was distinguished in the Russian civil war for his sadistic cruelty and zealous devotion to monarchism. In 1921 Ungern and his "Asian Division of Cavalry" invaded Mongolia, then under Chinese republican control, and established an independent Mongolia with Ungern as regent, and then monarch. The 'Mad Baron', speculated by many Mongolians to be the reincarnation of Genghis Khan, now strives to unite the Mongolian people beneath his banner, and perhaps one day restore Mongolia to its medieval glory."
POLITICS_STERNBERG_KHAN_DESC:0 "Roman von Ungern-Sternberg has united the Mongolian people and proclaimed the formation of a new Mongolian Khanate with himself as Khan. With a nod to his supposed status as the reincarnation of Genghis Khan himself, Sternberg has taken the regal name Genghis Khan II. The new Khan rallies then Mongolian tribes to his banner, and the nations of Eurasia look warily upon his growing host."
POLITICS_BORIS_REZUKHIN_DESC:0 "Boris Rezukhin, former right hand of Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, has, with the death of Sternberg, ascended to the Mongolian throne. Rezukhin faces opposition from many Mongolians, believing Rezukhin to be responsible for the death of the nearly divine Sternberg. Rezukhin must now establish his legitimacy, and perhaps accoplish what Sternberg could not: the restoration of Mongolia to its former glory."
POLITICS_CHANGKYA_KHUTUKHTU_DESC:0 "Lobsang Pelden Tenpe Dronme, the Seventh Changkya Khutukhtu, fled from inner Mongolia to Mongolia proper with the expulsion of the Chinese by Roman von Ungern-Sternberg. His position within Gelug Buddhism and support for Sternberg's claims of divinity legitimised Sternberg. The Seventh Changkya Khutukhtu has now become regent of Mongolia, promising to care for the throne and the country until a spiritual successor to Sternberg is found."
POLITICS_ZHELNE_KHATUN_DESC:0 "Zhelne Khatun was the wife of Roman von Ungern-Sternberg until Roman's death. She has become queen-regent of Mongolia, ruling in her son's stead until he is old enough to succeed his father. Rumors abound, however, that Zhelne was involved in the death of her husband, undermining her authority."
POLITICS_GENGHIS_KHAN_III_DESC:0 "Theodor von Ungern-Sternberg, has succeeded his father to the Mongolian throne, and taken the royal name: Genghis Khan III. While many Mongolian morn the death of their Khan, they see in his son the opportunity to continue the project of national restoration that led to the establishment of the new Khanate."
POLITICS_TRIBAL_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "With the death of Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, many of the nomadic tribes of Mongolia united in opposition to the Russian dominated Mongolian military, who they believed responsible for Sternberg's death. These tribes, with the defeat of the military, have now formed from among their leaders a council to guide the Mongolian nation. Much infighting exists amongst the council, however, and many advocate the restoration of the monarchy."

With most of Central Asia in his hands, Ungern Khan rules all Mongolic peoples and everyone living in a yurt swears allegiance to him alone. A man beyond the capabilities of other mortals, Ungern is thought of by many Mongolians as an avatar of the God of War or in the very least – as a reincarnation of the great Genghis Khan and with his newest victories those doubting these claims have been reduced to a mere handful. Fuelled by the sweet fruits of victory Ungern Khan has convened a grand assembly in Urga to manifest the triumph of Mongolia's recent conquests. The question, however, remains whether or not the Mad Baron will satisfy himself with the establishment of a Greater Mongolia or take his faithful tribal forces and his hardened Savage Division further on the path of ambition, madness and glory?"

However, his officers and generals always waited for the right moment to overthrow him, as they considered him an out-of-control warmonger who had no mercy even for his trusted lieutenants. Conspirators in the general staff had thus been plotting Ungern's demise for some time, but only saw their chance when the population of Mongolia started rebelling. The widespread civil disorder was thus used as the cover to kill Ungern and disband his government. Commanders loyal to the Khan were arrested without any warning and all major sites in Urga occupied by the putschists. As the rebels stormed the Baron's residence, Ungern viciously defended himself shooting several leading conspirators in a desperate firefight. However, as the last of his bodyguards fell and the structure caught fire, Ungern Khan turned his weapon upon himself. Thus, in fire and blood, the mad reign of Ungern Khan came to an end."

Thus, in fire and blood, the mad reign of Ungern Khan, Genghis Khan's reincarnation, came to an end. The new era of Mongolia has begun - but there is still the question about the future of this era. Some conspirators want to rule the country behind the back of new monarch - Ungern's wife or his little son, while some of them want to form a military government. Mongolia is at the crossroads of history once again."

mongolia.35.d:0 "Today newspapers around the world has been filled with the news of the assassination of the Russian president, Alexander Kerensky. Due to the assassination, Russia has fallen into domestic chaos and will thus not be interested nor capable of intervening in domestic Mongolian politics. Roman von Ungern-Sternberg understands that this is the right time to make Mongolia as great as it once was, but he needs a skilled second in command to succeed. Will he choose his loyal general from the Asiatic Cavalry Division, Boris Rezukhin? Or maybe the current head of government, the Mongolian aristocrat Tögs-Ochiryn Namnansüren to further consolidate his popularity with the Mongol people? Finally the religious leader, the 7th Changkya Khutukhtu, could be chosen to guarantee Ungern's divine status and prove his direct reincarnation as the God of War?"

mongolia.37.d:0 "Tibet is now under hooves of our horses...But we should remember our long friendship and cooperation with this people. Their government will be punished for their betrayal, but citizens of Tibetan mountains will probably agree to join our Empire under the rule of glorious Genghis Khan II!

mongolia.38.t:0 "Dealing with the Lhasa Regime"
mongolia.38.d:0 "Tibet always enjoyed cordial relations with Mongolia, but once they heard about the restoration of our Great Empire, the cowardly government in Lhasa turned their back upon Ungern. The union of the two peoples and the consolidation of Buddhism's two great centres would cement Ungern's claim to a new Mongolian Empire. We should liberate Tibet from the heretical traitors who care more about their moneybags than about their people. Our armies are ready to bring peace and prosperity to Tibet - Genghis Khan II has to unite all Mongolic peoples into one nation. It's our destiny."

mongolia.40.t:0 "Tribal Revolt!"
mongolia.40.d:0 "The Mongols always held von Ungern-Sternberg in high regards and called him 'Ak Bagatur' – 'The White Warrior'. It was generally believed that he was a reincarnation of Genghis Khan and as such didn't care much about his original Russian upbringing. But when Ungern was overthrown and his generals took power, the Mongol population was deeply disappointed with the successor's behaviour. The former commanders of Ungern's army considered themselves Russians and ruled Mongolia as if were a colony and not their motherland. This oppression combined with the strictness of a military regime caused a wave of riots in the Mongolian army, which consisted of various tribesmen under command of steppe nobility. Leaders of the Mongol tribes under the command of the aristocratic 'noyan' Amagaiin Bajudai started a massive anti-government revolt under the slogan of "Mongolian tribes against the Russian oppressors". Soon a wave of terror covered the steppes..."

Now that the South lies in the hands of the Mongolians once more, the khan is considering whether to claim the port of Macau from the Portuguese or to not interfere with the ownership of the city sold before the rise of the Mongols."
mongolia.48.a:0 "It belongs to China!"
mongolia.48.b:0 "Let the idea slide."
mongolia.49.t:0 "Mongol Demands"
mongolia.49.d:0 "After centuries, the Mongol Khan now decided to demand Macau from us. The Mongol Empire is now one of the strongest states in the Far East and fighting them is probably not a good idea."
