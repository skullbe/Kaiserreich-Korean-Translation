### Pre-CW Political Focus ###

SAF_crisis:0 "Dealing with the Crisis"
SAF_crisis_desc:0 "The economic crisis threatens to tear the Union apart. We must reform our country's economy to solve mass unemployment, but the Volksraad stands divided on the path to take forwards. This choice will certainly have repercussions in the years to come, and may even exacerbate existing divides."

SAF_representation_of_natives:0 "Representation of the Natives"
SAF_representation_of_natives_tt:0 "Gets event '§YThe Representation of Natives Act of 1936§!'."
SAF_representation_of_natives_desc:0 "Originally planned before the current economic crisis took hold, the Representation of Natives Act of 1936 will become the centrepiece of upcoming social and political reforms within the country. The original provisions will probably have to be altered significantly, however."

SAF_protectorates:0 "Status of the Protectorates"
SAF_protectorates_desc:0 "The old HCTs are still mere protectorates within our sovereign territory. To develop them any further, we must integrate them into our country. This will however not be a simple task, and multiple paths are open to us. All of them are likely to lead to durable political unrest, however."

SAF_paramount_chiefs:0 "Extend Native Autonomy"
SAF_paramount_chiefs_desc:0 "Granting autonomy to the local rulers of the former HCTs will allow us to install new, autonomous Paramount Chiefs of their respective ethnic groups (the Tswana in Bechuanaland, the Basotho in Basotuland and the Swazi in Swaziland) loyal to the central government."

SAF_personal_forces:0 "Personal Forces of the Paramount Chiefs"
SAF_personal_forces_desc:0 "Given the increased autonomy of the Paramount Chiefs, some of them are asking to be allowed to raise their own forces comprised of their respective tribesmen to better secure their own positions. While arming natives is an unpalatable prospect, it would reduce the strain upon the Union's armed forces."

SAF_askari:0 "Askari Corps for the Union"
SAF_askari_desc:0 "Now that we have armed certain ethnic groups, hawks in the Volksraad are suggesting that we may as well raise our own native units, ones that would be loyal not to the Paramount Chiefs but to the Union."

SAF_nuweveld:0 "Nuweveld Settlements"
SAF_nuweveld_desc:0 "Turning the newly annexed territories over to white settlers will encourage the establishment of new settlements throughout the Nuweveld and the cultural integration of the new regions. The locals however would lose access to most agricultural lands, forcing them to migrate to the cities for work as transient labour."

SAF_native_rights:0 "Native Rights"
SAF_native_rights_desc:0 "The integration of the Nuweveld territories and the desperate need for cheap and plentiful labour in those regions has raised the issue of Native rights. Many politicians are now ready to make radical compromises in a few categories."

SAF_gesuiwerde_infrastructure:0 "The Kariba Dam"
SAF_gesuiwerde_infrastructure_desc:0 "Plans for a hydro-electric dam on the Zambezi have up until now been ruled out as prohibitively costly, but with access to plentiful local native labour, this massive project can now go ahead. We should start by reclaiming the land around the dam."

SAF_gesuiwerde_mines:0 "Nuweveld Mines"
SAF_gesuiwerde_mines_desc:0 "The new reserves of native labour allow us to significantly expand our mining capacity in the Nuweveld, giving us the potential of producing ores on an industrial scale."

SAF_gesuiwerde_steelworks:0 "Vanderbijlpark's Steelworks"
SAF_gesuiwerde_steelworks_desc: "The new reserves of native labour allow us to significantly expand South Africa's steel production with a new large-scale facility at Vanderbijlpark."

SAF_gesuiwerde_dam:0 "Finish the Kariba Dam"
SAF_gesuiwerde_dam_desc:0 "Finishing the Kariba Dam will take long and arduous work, but it will provide plenty of energy for our expanding industry in Rhodesia."

SAF_national_recovery_plan:0 "National Recovery Plan"
SAF_national_recovery_plan_desc:0 "We must now move to resolve the economic crisis in our nation brought on by the global crash. Each political faction has put a plan forwards, the choice is now ours."

SAF_industrialization:0 "Industrialisation"
SAF_industrialization_desc:0 "The Gesuiwerde are pushing for increased industrialisation, but the cost at this stage could be prohibitive. Nevertheless, we must push forwards to solve the current crisis."

SAF_witwatersrand:0 "The Witwatersrand Basin"
SAF_witwatersrand_desc:0 "We have begun our efforts to further industrialise our nation. Through the entire Witwatersrand basin roads and railway tracks are being built and new steel mills constructed, bringing thousands back into the workforce."

SAF_new_mines:0 "Industrial Mining"
SAF_new_mines_desc:0 "Industrialisation continues at an impressive pace with new mines opening every month across the Orange Free State and the Transvaal. The roads of Johannesburg and Pretoria equal that of any European city. But there is discontent rising from the British provinces, who believe that our program is unfairly weighted towards the Afrikaans speaking areas."

SAF_complete_industrialisation:0 "The Afrikaner Recovery"
SAF_complete_industrialisation_desc:0 "We have finally solved our economic crisis and solidified our status as the most industrialised nation in Africa! The cost however has been severe, financially, politically and socially. Our focus upon the former Boer Republics has left a bitter taste in the mouths of the British provinces, who are still seeing high levels of unemployment."

SAF_detente:0 "Détente"
SAF_detente_desc:0 "In an effort to bring our economy back from the crash brought on by German trade dependence, we have decided to look back towards the old empires for new trade opportunities. It is hoped that in so doing, British and French investment will create job opportunities for South Africa's unemployed."

SAF_new_docks:0 "Entente Harbour Investments"
SAF_new_docks_desc:0 "Ever since we improved relations with the Entente, British and French capital has poured into our country, with private firms taking the initiative and investing in new docks in Durban and Port Elizabeth and miles of train track across the Cape to ease congestion at Capetown."

SAF_Kimberley_mines:0 "Kimberley Mines"
SAF_Kimberley_mines_desc:0 "The influx of capital from the Entente continues to grow our economy. New mines have opened in Kimberley, but some members of the Gesuiwerde and even our own party have spoken out against the clear focus on British dominated parts of the country."

SAF_complete_detente:0 "The British Recovery"
SAF_complete_detente_desc:0 "We have finally solved our economic crisis and solidified our status as the most industrialised nation in Africa! However, the former Boer Republics seem to have been left behind. Unemployment there is still a problem, as most of the jobs created have been in the Cape, and those have gone to Coloured or Native workers."

SAF_work_programs:0 "General Work Program"
SAF_work_programs_desc:0 "The majority of the party is in support of a general work program for the unemployed, this being a safe bet to get our economy back on its feet once again."

SAF_new_roads:0 "Major Roadworks"
SAF_new_roads_desc:0 "The Union is in dire need of better roads even in its southern territories. Luckily, we now have access to a lot of city labour ready to link up the Natal, Transvaal and Cape provinces."

SAF_orange_river_mines:0 "Orange River Mines"
SAF_orange_river_mines_desc:0 "Our improved infrastructure now allows us to exploit new ore veins on the Orange River. A transport hub is also to be constructed at Hopetown to help with the exploitation of the mineral riches."

SAF_complete_work_programs:0 "The General Recovery"
SAF_complete_work_programs_desc:0 "We have finally solved our economic crisis and solidified our status as the most industrialised nation in Africa! With unemployment under control, the Rand growing in value and our number of exports reach new heights, all our citizens have something to be proud of!"

SAF_extra_slot:0 "Fund the Cape Town University"
SAF_extra_slot_desc:0 "With the economy back on track, it is important to remember that scholarly pursuits are needed to maintain our position in Africa. Generous funding increases to the Cape Town University will allow us to educate the masses and become a beacon in a still dark continent."

### Pre-CW Army Focus ###

SAF_special_service:0 "Black Monday Conscripts"
SAF_special_service_desc:0 "For a while, we have had tremendous issues recruiting new servicemen. But now that the Black Monday has struck, recruitment centres are flooded with new conscripts. We must work to rapidly integrate these new units and reform our army for large scale operations."

SAF_weltkrieg_relics:0 "Relics of the Weltkrieg"
SAF_weltkrieg_relics_desc:0 "Our infantry's equipment is old, very old. Most of it has seen service during the Weltkrieg, and some sets have even seen action during the First Boer War. We must equip our army with modern gear, or else we will not stand a chance in another war."

SAF_Q_corps:0 "Q Services Corps"
SAF_Q_corps_desc:0 "The Q Services Corps will be the centralised authority responsible for the logistics and supply of the permanent army. It will handle the distribution of oil, rations, ammo and uniforms. The work ahead of them is great, for Africa is a huge and hostile continent."

SAF_doctrine_effort:0 "South African Military College"
SAF_doctrine_effort_desc:0 "South Africa should have a military academy modelled on the lines of the Preußische Kriegsakademie. This will give us a professional officer corps loyal to the Union, and rich of the knowledge of European military academies."

SAF_weltkrieg_relics_2:0 "African Thunder"
SAF_weltkrieg_relics_2_desc:0 "It is no secret to anyone that large artillery pieces have no place in African battlefields. Our military engineers have developed an ambitious project, called African Thunder, to rapidly develop up-to-date light artillery pieces purpose-fit for the jungles."

SAF_doctrine_effort_2:0 "Native NCOs"
SAF_doctrine_effort_2_desc:0 "While Natives are no stranger to serving in our nation's military, the efficiency of their units is often compromised by a lack of co-operation with the exclusively Afrikaner and British command. A campaign to promote Native NCOs should help better organise these units."

SAF_armor_effort:0 "African Tanks"
SAF_armor_effort_desc:0 "Designing tanks with the capacity to operate in African lands is no small task. One must not be fooled by the large prairies surrounding the Cape, those tanks will inevitably face desert and jungle as they advance northwards. European roads are far from here."

SAF_special_forces:0 "The SASF"
SAF_special_forces_desc:0 "Africa presents many extreme environments. Large, sprawling jungles. Endless deserts. Immense oceans surrounding it and wielding the world's trade. Huge, tropical rivers. We will need special divisions, ready to stop at nothing to escort our army forwards."

SAF_support_companies:0 "Expand the Support Companies"
SAF_support_companies_desc:0 "Africa is a treacherous land, and it is our military engineers, medics and maintenance companies that often keep entire units alive and on the move. However, as our army expands, so too must our support companies. They are the backbone of our operations, after all."

SAF_commit_to_the_five_year_plan_mod:0 "Commit to the Five-Year Plan"
SAF_commit_to_the_five_year_plan_mod_desc:0 "Before the Black Monday struck our country, we had developed a Five-Year Plan for the modernisation and expansion of the South African air force. The government must publicly commit to not fall behind this schedule. Africa will take to the air."

SAF_improve_the_hawker_hartbees_mod:0 "Improve the Hawker Hartbees"
SAF_improve_the_hawker_hartbees_mod_desc:0 "The Hawker Hartbees we have are not the most advanced fighters in the world, but we will make do. Improved mechanics and training will get the most out of these biplanes until we finally get the opportunity to replace them."

SAF_replace_the_blenheim_mod:0 "Replace the Blenheim"
SAF_replace_the_blenheim_mod_desc:0 "The Bristol Blenheim has been a serviceable light bomber for our airforce, but it may be time to find something sturdier, with a longer range that can cover the African wastes and jungles."

SAF_perfect_the_cab_rank_technique_mod:0 "Perfect the 'Cab-Rank' Technique"
SAF_perfect_the_cab_rank_technique_mod_desc:0 "The 'Cab-Rank' Technique has a series of bombers strike a target one at a time, in a long row. This maintains pressure on the enemy, but takes a great amount of skill. We must continue drilling our pilots."

SAF_desert_air_force_mod:0 "Desert Air Force"
SAF_desert_air_force_mod_desc:0 "The desert skies are clear and the landscape forgiving, but the heat and sand means special attention is required to the mechanics of our aircraft. There are valuable skills to be learned in this unforgiving environment."

SAF_secure_the_cape_sea_route_mod:0 "Secure the Cape Sea Route"
SAF_secure_the_cape_sea_route_mod_desc:0 "Should the Suez Canal be blocked by conflict, the Cape will once again become the temporary gateway to the East. We must prepare to defend it at all costs from the navies of the great powers."

SAF_retain_experienced_pilots_mod:0 "Retain Experienced Pilots"
SAF_retain_experienced_pilots_mod_desc:0 "Too often our experienced pilots move on to join European and American airforces instead of staying with our own force. While they yield better opportunities for advancement and combat, we should endeavour to keep our trained pilots close to home where they can inspire and educate other South Africans."

SAF_seaward_defence_force_mod:0 "Seaward Defence Force"
SAF_seaward_defence_force_mod_desc:0 "The Seaward Defence Force has served as our navy for two decades. Even as the crisis consumes our country, we should increase its funding. The Cape has always been vulnerable to attack without it and the protection of the British."

SAF_protect_the_trade_mod:0 "Protect the Trade"
SAF_protect_the_trade_mod_desc:0 "The last war showed the importance of convoys and escorts. South Africa lies on a major trade route and should make sure that the goods get through to their destination, no matter the cost."

SAF_disrupt_the_trade_mod:0 "Disrupt the Trade"
SAF_disrupt_the_trade_mod_desc:0 "The last war showed the importance of convoys and escorts. South Africa lies on a major trade route and is ideally situated to intercept and destroy enemy shipping."

SAF_expand_the_simons_town_base_mod:0 "Expand the Simon's Town Base"
SAF_expand_the_simons_town_base_mod_desc:0 "Simon's Town on the Cape has been the most important naval base in southern Africa since the 1790s. It should be refitted and expanded to accommodate more and larger vessels."

SAF_anti_uboat_tactics_desc:0 "U-Boats threaten the ships that pass through the Cape of Good Hope. We must find and destroy them."

SAF_uboat_warfare:0 "U-Boat Warfare"
SAF_uboat_warfare_desc:0 "Enemy trade convoys continue to use the pass through the Cape of Good Hope. We will strike them from below."

SAF_prepare_overseas_offensive_mod:0 "Prepare Overseas Offensive"
SAF_prepare_overseas_offensive_mod_desc:0 "With miles of coastline, South Africa is fit to train its soldiers in amphibious war. This is one of the most difficult of skills, but our boys can handle it."

SAF_strengthen_the_cape_garrison_artillery_mod:0 "Strengthen the Cape Garrison Artillery"
SAF_strengthen_the_cape_garrison_artillery_mod_desc:0 "The Cape Garrison guns must be upgraded and increased to protect the Cape from enemy attack. No enemies shall set a foot on the Cape!"

### CW and Post-CW Focus ###

SAF_1938_elections:0 "The 1938 General Elections"
SAF_1938_elections_tt:0 "We will get access to major internal and diplomatic reforms and stances once the '§Y1938 General Elections§!' take place and a new party and ideology is chosen to lead South Africa forwards. Pending any inconveniences, that is."
SAF_1938_elections_desc: "Scheduled to take place in May of 1938, the South African General Elections will probably be the most polarised our country has ever seen, with two radically different views of our country's future in play. The stakes are high, as whoever wins will choose the path forward, and there are no obvious favourites yet."

SAF_nationalist_reform:0 "The Apartheid Process"
SAF_nationalist_reform_desc:0 "The victory of the Nationalists in the 1938 Elections also implies the victory of all the ideas that had since sat on the fringes of the ruling party. At the centre of it all, the concept of the Apartheid calls for the separation of races. This will have to be done quickly and decisively, before the Coloured and their British allies get any ideas."

SAF_dominionist_reform:0 "The Port Elisabeth Declaration"
SAF_dominionist_reform_desc:0 "The victory of the Dominionists in the 1938 Elections also implies the victory of all the ideas that had since been struck out of the Afrikaner-dominated government. At the centre of it all, the hope of repairing what is seen as the historical mistake of betraying the British. No small moves or diplomatic niceties will suffice, but the Afrikaners might not take it lightly"

SAF_implement_apartheid:0 "Implement the Apartheid"
SAF_implement_apartheid_desc:0 "After a period of consolidation, we are now in a position to strengthen existing segregation laws to bring about full separation of the four South African nations both socially and politically. The Volksraad is behind us and set to carry our governments program through."

SAF_join_mitteleuropa:0 "Request to Join Mitteleuropa"
SAF_join_mitteleuropa_desc:0 "Now that we have a firm grasp on our internal politics we should seek to expand our foreign ties, the perfect way to do this would be by requesting to formally join Mitteleuropa"

SAF_implement_federation:0 "Implement the Federation"
SAF_implement_federation_desc:0 "While we have been calling ourselves the South African Federation for a while, we have not yet implemented all the reforms we needed to make that change official. With the country stabilised and our opposition beaten, we can now move and rewrite the Constitution. The Union is no more, but South Africa lives on."

SAF_rejoin_entente:0 "Request to Rejoin the Empire"
SAF_rejoin_entente_desc:0 "Now that we have a firm grip on our internal politics we should seek to rectify the biggest mistake of our history and formally request to rejoin the Empire and Entente."

### Ideas ###

racial_segregation:0 "Racial Segregation"
racial_segregation_desc:0 "South Africa is a divided nation. While the vast majority of the population belongs to the various native ethnic African groups, socio-economic power is held by the white European minority. This in turn is divided between the Afrikaners, Dutch-speaking descendants of the original Dutch colonists and the Boers who settled the Transvall and Orange Free State, and the British who form the majority of the white population in Natal and Rhodesia."

racial_segregation_apartheid:0 "Apartheid"
racial_segregation_apartheid_desc:0 "South Africa is a divided nation. While the vast majority of the population belong to the various native ethnic African groups, socio-economic power is held by the white European minority. The recent implementation of the Apartheid has exacerbated tensions, but has also allowed the state to brutally expand its conscription to fit the need for a larger law enforcement force."

paramount_chiefs:0 "Paramount Chiefs"
paramount_chiefs_desc:0 "We have left a great deal of autonomy to the newly integrated HCTs. This and the goodwill of the new Paramount Chiefs ensures political and economic stability in the Native lands for the years to come."

local_paramount_chiefs:0 "Local Native Development"
local_paramount_chiefs_desc:0 "We have limited Native development efforts to the regions where the Paramount Chiefs operate. This however limits their impact on the development of the country's industrial output."

full_paramount_chiefs:0 "Expanded Native Development"
full_paramount_chiefs_desc:0 "We have expanded Native development efforts to the entire country. This allows us to mobilise their goodwill to significantly improve our country's industrial output."

chief_personal_forces:0 "Personal Forces of the Paramount Chiefs"
chief_personal_forces_desc:0 "The Paramount Chiefs have assembled personal forces to defend their tribal lands. On the flipside, these troops can easily be drafted into the army, should the time for conflict come again."

askari_kommando:0 "Askari Corps"
askari_kommando_desc:0 "Native units from the old HCT regions supply our army with determined soldiers ready to fight to the death to defend their ancestral homeland, and also allows us to get Native regulars in rank, increasing the overall effectiveness of our entire army."

SAF_industry:0 "Industrialisation Projects"
SAF_industry_desc:0 "Great projects have been started to industrialise our country. While the results might not be obvious yet, we will eventually reap the rewards. In the meantime, we must focus on infrastructure works."

SAF_open_new_mines:0 "New Mines"
SAF_open_new_mines_desc:0 "It was no mystery to the previous colonial administrations that the South African lands are one of a great mineral wealth. However, no-one has had the ambition to open large mine networks to harvest the resources buried deep below. Until now."

SAF_open_borders:0 "Entente Specialists"
SAF_open_borders_desc:0 "The resumption of trade with the Entente has led to English and French specialists investing effort and time into our country, improving our research significantly. No doubt, this is only a small taste of the cooperation soon to develop should we continue to restore our links with them."

work_programs_idea:0 "General Work Program"
work_programs_idea_desc:0 "By starting a program targeted towards getting the unemployed back to work, we can rapidly alleviate the worst impacts of the current crisis on our society. This will create an austere but secure economy for the years to come."

nuweveld_idea:0 "Nuweveld Settlements"
nuweveld_idea_desc:0 "The Nuweveld Settlements allow us to better organise the old tribal farmlands under the supervision of white settlers, while forcing the Natives to migrate to the cities to find work in our industry. A win-win situation for our economy."

native_labour_idea:0 "Native Labour in the Nuweveld"
native_labour_idea_desc:0 "With some Native right suspended in the Nuweveld, productivity has increased noticeably and major projects are being planned. Of course, the Native workers aren't too happy by this state of affairs, but they aren't the ones wielding the rifles."

gesuiwerde_plan_idea:0 "Forced Labour in the Nuweveld"
gesuiwerde_plan_idea_desc:0 "With all Native rights suspended in the Nuweveld, productivity has skyrocketed and major projects are being planned. Of course, the Native workers are appalled by the current situation, but they aren't the ones wielding the rifles"

SAF_black_monday:0 "Black Monday"

### Events ###

SAF.1.t:0 "The Black Monday hits South Africa"
SAF.1.d:0 "On the 3rd of February, the German stock market collapsed, plunging the world into depression. South Africa has relied on trade with Germany and its sphere of influence since the British Revolution and the declaration of the South African Republic and withdrawal from trade with the remaining members of the Entente.\n\nThe crisis has had a terrible effect upon the South African economy, unemployment has risen markedly as many companies that depended upon the German export market went out of business or laid off white workers in favour of native labour."
SAF.1.a:0 "This is a disaster!"

SAF.2.t:0 "Dealing with the Crisis"
SAF.2.d:0 "The global economic crisis has hit South Africa hard, leaving our economy in tatters and bringing our institutions to the brink of a full political crisis. Our dependence on trade with Germany, long criticised by the pro-British Dominion Party, has seen deepening hardship take hold. However, the Volksraad is divided on how best to deal with the crisis.\n\nCheap native labour is seen by many as the chief cause of unemployment and both the National Party and South African Labour Party are calling for further restrictions to be made upon native employment. The National Party also views that an ambitious works program and an exploitation of the Protectorates could alleviate the situation, while SA Labour feels that socio-economic reform is key to solving the crisis.\n\nThe Dominion Party points again to the dependence on Germany and seeks a liberalisation of the economy and a resumption of ties with the Entente and the Empire, although large tracts of Afrikaner society would baulk at the mere prospect of such a heel turn after two decades of independence."
SAF.2.a:0 "The National Party will solve this crisis alone."
SAF.2.b:0 "Work with our old coalition partners, Labour."
SAF.2.c:0 "Co-operate with the Dominionists."

SAF.3.t:0 "The National Party Splits"
SAF.3.d:0 "Unwilling to compromise their values, the more extreme wing of the National Party led by Daniel François Malan has broken away to form the 'Gesuiwerde' or Purified National Party. They reject any compromise with either the British or the reds and believe that the best way to ensure the future of South Africa is to strengthen and expand the existing provincial segregation laws into a full nation-wide system, termed 'apartheid'."
SAF.3.a:0 "Oh dear!"

SAF.4.t:0 "The Union of South Africa"
SAF.4.d:0 "Formed in 1910 as a merger of the various British possessions in South Africa, the Cape Colony, Natal, Transvaal and the Orange Free State, the Union of South Africa is currently a parliamentary Republic, having seceded from the British Empire during the crisis of 1925. The British Revolution gave the anti-British coalition of the National and Labour Parties the opportunity to break free from British influence that they had been under since the end of the 2nd Boer War (1899-1902).\n\nThe first President of South Africa, James Hertzog, used the chaos to annex the neighbouring British protectorates of South Rhodesia, Bechuanaland, Basotuland and Swaziland while leaving the remainder of Britain's African colonies to fall into the hands of the German Freistaat.\n\nSouth Africa's current constitution is an adaption of the 1909 South Africa Act. The Union of South Africa is an unitary state, rather than a federation, with each colony's parliaments abolished and replaced with provincial councils.\n\nThe Parliament consists of two parts, the Volksraad and Senate. The Volksraad members are elected mostly by the country's white minority although the franchise varies depending upon the province, of which there are five: Cape, Natal, the Orange Free State, Transvaal and Rhodesia. In the Cape and Natal, a qualified franchise based upon property and education requirements is in place while the vote is white only in the remaining provinces.\n\nThe Senate is appointed by an electoral college consisting of members of each of the five Provincial Councils and members of the Volksraad. The Government follows the Westminster model, although with an elected President as head of state.\n\nSouth Africa continues to administer Bechuanaland, Basotuland and Swaziland as protectorates and while considerable legislation is in place restricting the rights of the native population within the Union, it has not been fully implemented in these territories."

SAF.5.t:0 "The Representation of Natives Act of 1936"
SAF.5.d:0 "Originally planned before the current economic crisis took hold, the Representation of Natives Act is meant to further solidify white political control in South Africa by repealing the Cape Qualified Franchise and its similar counterpart in Natal that allows a small section of the native population to take part in elections. This would be done by taking natives out of the electoral rolls completely, with chiefs, local councils, urban advisory boards and election committees in all five provinces electing five whites to the Senate by a system of block voting.\n\nHowever, in this new political climate the Gesuiwerde National Party are advising we use this opportunity to appease our core electoral support, the Afrikaners, by attacking part the Dominionists' electorate by proscribing Coloureds as well as natives from voting. Such a move would draw the ire of the other sections of South African society and is something we are perhaps not ready for just yet.\n\nThere is also the question of whether to establish a Native Representative Council, a move denounced by liberals who view it as an attempt to not just disenfranchise the natives but to separate them politically from our national polity."
SAF.5.a:0 "Establish the Native Representative Council!"
SAF.5.b:0 "Pass the original text."
SAF.5.c:0 "Coloureds will also be barred from elections!"

SAF.6.d:0 "Originally planned before the current economic crisis took hold, the Representation of Natives Act is meant to further solidify white political control in South Africa by repealing the Cape Qualified Franchise and its similar counterpart in Natal that allows a small section of the native population to take part in elections. This would be done by taking natives out of the electoral rolls completely, with chiefs, local councils, urban advisory boards and election committees in all five provinces electing five whites to the Senate by a system of block voting.\n\nHowever, due to our coalition with the Dominionists, their Progressive wing are advising we expand the number of allotted representatives in the Senate from five to ten and to be allowed to elect an equal number to sit in the Volksraad. Afrikaner nationalists in our party are vehemently against such moderating measures and we fear many will leave for Malan's breakaway GNP.\n\nWe could however, always fall back on the promise of a Native Representative Council to balance the desires of both factions."
SAF.6.b:0 "Amend the original text."
SAF.6.c:0 "The coalition falls apart!"

SAF.7.t:0 "The Gesuiwerde Rejoin the Government"
SAF.7.d:0 "Malan's Gesuiwerde have returned, following the breakup of our coalition with Smut's Dominionists. The Gesuiwerde are now strongly pushing their proposals to attack the British position in the Cape by restricting the Coloured vote as well. The situation is volatile, but it is a move that will be welcomed by our core support."
SAF.7.a:0 "Just establish the Native Representative Council!"
SAF.7.b:0 "Concede to the Gesuiwerde!"

SAF.8.t:0 "The Status of the Protectorates"
SAF.8.d:0 "Now that we have dealt with the issue of natives within our traditional borders, we should address the status of the former British protectorates of Bechuanaland, Basotuland and Swaziland. While South Rhodesia was integrated as the fifth province of our Union because of its white population, the protectorates (High Commission Territories as they were referred to under British control) were kept as they were before 1925 and governed by South African Commissioners in conjunction with local rulers.\n\nYet as time has moved on, pressure has grown demanding their full incorporation into South Africa, mainly by Afrikaner nationalists who view the territory as 'Nuweveld', cheap land for Afrikaner farmers to claim.\n\nDominionists however want their incorporation but with control still in the hands of local rulers who would be elevated to the status of Paramount Chiefs of their respective ethnic groups."
SAF.8.a:0 "Grant power to the new Paramount Chiefs."
SAF.8.b:0 "They shall become the Nuweveld!"

SAF.9.t:0 "The National Recovery Plan"
SAF.9.d:0 "We must now move to resolve the economic crisis plaguing our nation. The majority of the party is in support of a general work program for the unemployed, the idea being that this will get our economy back on its feet again and have a rapid impact on the issues most resented by the people.\n\nThe Gesuiwerde are pushing for increased industrialisation, but while the long term benefits would be immense, the cost at this stage could be prohibitive.\n\nThe Dominionists, meanwhile, are suggesting a liberalisation of the economy and redirecting our trade to the British and the Entente at large, they may be right in their attempts to tackle this crisis, but it would certainly be very unpopular outside the Cape and Natal."
SAF.9.a:0 "Create jobs for the unemployed!"
SAF.9.b:0 "We must industrialise!"
SAF.9.c:0 "Liberalise the economy!"

SAF.10.t:0 "The Extent of Native Autonomy"
SAF.10.d:0 "The increased autonomy of the former HCT provinces, under the leadership of the new Paramount Chiefs (the Tswana in Bechuanaland, the Basotho in Basotuland amd the Swazi in Swaziland), has seen increased economic opportunity for Africans. However, we need to clarify the extent of the power of the Chiefs.\n\nLocal autonomy would be widely accepted but would also limit the potential of this decentralisation effort.\n\nExpanding it to the entire Union, however, would allow us to unlock the true potential of the Native population, with the risk of seriously upsetting the Boer populations."
SAF.10.a:0 "Their authority stops at the border."
SAF.10.b:0 "They will fully represent their people."

SAF.11.t:0 "Native Rights"
SAF.11.d:0 "Our recent integration efforts of the Nuweveld and the economic crisis has brought the question of Native rights to the forefront of the current political debate.\n\nThe Dominionists have made their position clear, and ask of us to not make any compromise on the Natives' rights.\n\nThe Moderates recommend that we take a more tactful approach to the situation, only stripping non-essential rights to facilitate exploitation of their populations.\n\nThe Gesuiwerde, meanwhile, has proposed to simply put the Natives to forced labour, an explosive but straightforward proposal."
SAF.11.a:0 "We will not compromise on Native rights."
SAF.11.b:0 "Suspend some Native rights."
SAF.11.c:0 "Send the Natives to forced labour."

SAF.12.t:0 "South Africa wishes to Join Mitteleuropa"
SAF.12.d:0 "The government of South Africa has annouced recently that they want to join our alliance. It's not a sudden move because pro-German policy is popular in many circles including the government and the army. Do we want the South Africans to join us against our shared enemies, the French and the British?."
SAF.12.a:0 "YES!."
SAF.12.b:0 "Rather Not".

SAF.13.t:0 "South Africa wishes to rejoin the Entente"
SAF.13.d:0 "The government of the South African Federation has annouced recently that they want to return to the fold.

### SACW Events ###
SACW.1.t:0 "The Port Elizabeth Declaration"
SACW.1.d:0 "Today in Port Elizabeth the leading figures of the Dominion Party, General Jan C Smuts and Jan Hofmeyer, along with the provincial governors of the Cape, Natal and Rhodesia met to discuss the coming election in May. An agreement has been reached now that support for the Dominion Party and dissatisfaction with the ruling Nationalist government has reached the point where the pro-British faction could very well form the next administration. To that end, they have issued a declaration, stating their intent to reform the Union of South Africa into a new more liberal Federation and to pursue a reconciliation with the British Empire."
SACW.1.a:0 "Concerning."

SACW.2.t:0 "The 1938 Union of South Africa General Elections"
SACW.2.d:0 "The 1938 Union of South Africa General Elections have clearly transformed into a referendum on the country's future. Either the Nationalists will retain control of the Volksraad and set about solidifying white, Afrikaner rule through a full system of Apartheid or they will be defeated by the Dominion Party who will move to fully enact the Port Elizabeth Declaration and the formation of a new, federal South Africa.\n\nIn what is likely to become the most important election in the nation's history, tensions are running high as reports of violent incidents throughout the country increase with each passing day."
SACW.2.a:0 "The National Party Wins."
SACW.2.b:0 "The Dominion Party Wins."

SACW.3.t:0 "Implementing the Apartheid"
SACW.3.d:0 "The National Party has seen off the challenge by Smut's pro-British Dominionists. However, the election was dangerously close, the Nationalists only having a razor thin majority in the Volksraad. One of the more noticable outcomes of the election was that the Natives elected Dominionist representatives and the Coloured vote was overwhelmingly pro-British.\n\nThe hawks on the right wing of our majority are warning that we should move immediately to sever the political ties between the races in the Union of South Africa once and for all by finally bringing the Apartheid into existence. However, the atmosphere is very tense and any harsh moves could very well be met by determined resistance from our political opposition."
SACW.3.a:0 "Begin the process of Apartheid!"

SACW.4.t:0 "Implementing the Port Elizabeth Declaration"
SACW.4.d:0 "The Dominion Party has finally defeated Cronje's pro-Afrikaner Nationalist Party and gained control of the Volksraad. However, the election was dangerously close, the Dominionist only having a razor thin majority in the Volksraad. While gains were limited in Afrikaner-dominated areas, Native and Coloured voters have overwhelmingly endorsed our proposed federal model.\n\nOur representatives recommend that we use their support to push ahead now and declare the end of the old Union and the start of the new South African Federation. However, the atmosphere is very tense, and we might want to wait until the climate is less hostile, as any harsh move now could very be met with determined resistance from our political opposition."
SACW.4.a:0 "Declare the start of a new Federation!"

SACW.5.t:0 "Construction of the Voortrekker Monument"
SACW.5.d:0 "Begun in 1935, the construction of the Voortrekker Monument is nearing completion. Situated in Pretoria, it commemorates the Voortrekkers who left the Cape Colony between 1835 and 1854 to found the Afrikaner Republics of the interior. Costs, however, continue to grow, but we are on schedule to open the Monument at the Centenary celebrations next year."
SACW.5.a:0 "It will be a lasting legacy!"

SACW.6.t:0 "Preperations for the Centenary Celebrations"
SACW.6.d:0 "The Centennial Anniversary of the Great Trek is little under a month away. The centenary celebrations are planned to commence with a re-enactment of the trek, beginning on 8 August 1938 with nine ox wagons departing from the the statue of Jan van Riebeeck in Cape Town and ending at the newly completed Voortrekker Monument in Pretoria, at which point the monument shall be inaugurated by the President.\n\nThe whole affair is meant to be a celebration of Afrikaner culture and heritage, but the situation in the country has since changed, and such a lavish event could very well be met with open hostility by the other racial groups and even the pro-British population who are likely to see it as a display of Afrikaner triumphalism. Shall we continue as planned or adopt a more modest approach?"
SACW.6.a:0 "It will go ahead as planned!"
SACW.6.b:0 "Perhaps a more modest approach is best."

SACW.7.t:0 "100th Anniversary of the Great Trek"
SACW.7.d:0 "One hundred years ago, our ancestors set out from the Cape, seeking life, land and liberty free from British domination. While the ceremony proceeded without incidents, the atmosphere was of a subdued nature in Cape Town as the re-enactment quietly departed to Pretoria under the stunned glares of the public."
SACW.7.a:0 "Could have been worse."

SACW.8.t:0 "Inauguration of the Voortrekker Monument"
SACW.8.d:0 "The reenactment of the Great Trek that left Cape Town 2 weeks ago has arrived in Pretoria. President Hertzog addressed the crowd, saying that unity was needed in these troubled times to preserve the Union of South Africa. The ceremony was a more reserved affair than many had expected, but the lack of any hostilities in response was a welcome relief for the government."
SACW.8.a:0 "Hurrah!"

SACW.9.t:0 "100th Anniversary of the Great Trek"
SACW.9.d:0 "One hundred years ago, our ancestors set out from the Cape, seeking life, land and liberty free from British domination. Unfortunately, large numbers of British and Coloureds attended the ceremony in protest, with attempts being made to impede the procession until police cleared a path. As a result of the scuffles, one of the wagons was destroyed and several of the participants injured."
SACW.9.a:0 "Oh Dear!"

SACW.10.t:0 "The Cape Town Riots"
SACW.10.d:0 "The Voortrek protests have grown and got out of hand as Cape Town has descended into chaos. Riots sweep the city, targeting symbols of Afrikaner history and culture such as the statue of Jan van Riebeeck, which has been completely torn down.\n\nPolice and military units stationed nearby are doing very little in the way of preventing these attacks, knowing that opening fire on the crowds will almost certainly trigger a revolt."
SACW.10.a:0 "Outrageous!"

SACW.11.t:0 "ISL Mineworkers Strike"
SACW.11.d:0 "The ISL Syndicalists have encouraged the mine workers of the Orange Free State to go on strike in support of the Native and Coloured riots.

SACW.11.a:0 "Red bastards!"

SACW.12.t:0 "Inauguration of the Voortrekker Monument"
SACW.12.d:0 "The reenactment of the Great Trek that left Cape Town 2 weeks ago has finally arrived in Pretoria. President Hertzog addressed the crowd, saying that the Afrikaner nation must stand together to preserve its way of life and that he would never surrender the Union of South Africa to either the Briton or the native. The ceremony was an extravagant affair, with tens of thousands attending. Pretoria and Johannesburg have been gripped in a nationalist frenzy, with incidents of violence being committed against British and native residents."
SACW.12.a:0 "We are proud Afrikaners!"

SACW.13.t:0 "The Natal Covenant"
SACW.13.d:0 "In response to Hertzog's speech in Pretoria, today in Durban City Hall the provincial governor and council of Natal have declared their secession from the Union of South Africa, effective immediately. They have drawn up a document referred to as the 'Natal Covenant' stating that they are loyal supporters of the British Empire and that as such they can no longer support our government.\n\nThousands of Natalians have signed the document and the governors and councils of Rhodesia and the Cape have openly declared their support to the document."
SACW.13.a:0 "If it's a fight they want."

SACW.14.t:0 "The End of the Union?"
SACW.14.d:0 "Now that three of the five provinces of the Union of South Africa have announced their intentions to secede, there are calls for us to renounce the fraying mantle of the Union, itself an imperialist anachronism. Instead they advise that we restore the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek, but perhaps that is a step too far?"

SACW.17.d:0 "The reenactment of the Great Trek that left Cape Town two weeks ago has arrived in Pretoria. President Smuts addressed the crowd, stating that unity was needed and that the rights of the Afrikaner community would be respected as we moved towards federalism. The ceremony was an overall success despite fringe protests by the Afrikaner Broederbond and other nationalist groups."
SACW.17.a:0 "Hurrah!"

SACW.18.t:0 "100th Anniversary of the Great Trek"
SACW.18.d:0 "One hundred years ago, our ancestors set out from the Cape, seeking life, land and liberty free from British domination. Unfortunately, the ceremony was lackluster and the poor funding of the event evident. However, this was offset by the large turnout of Afrikaners from other parts of South Africa to take part, including a group calling themselves the Ossewabrandwag (Ox-Wagon Sentinels).\n\nUnfortunately, this self-styled militia clashed with local police who struggled to handle the larger than expected turnout. With violence escalating out of control, the police tried to halt the procession and disperse the re-enactors which resulted in shots being exchanged, killing 3 policemen and 17 Ossewabrandwag, with many more re-enactors and bystanders injured."

SACW.19.t:0 "The Ossewabrandwag Riots"
SACW.19.d:0 "Throughout the former Boer Republics branches of the Ossewabrandwag have formed and have begun to organise protests against our government, many of them descending into rioting. The Afrikaner nationalists target natives and Britons alike as they view these groups as collaborating against them to destroy Afrikaner culture.

SACW.21.d:0 "The reenactment of the Great Trek that left Cape Town two weeks ago has arrived in Pretoria. President Smuts was unable to attend as recent incidents across the country compromised the security of the event. Instead, ex-president Hertzog made an unscheduled address the crowd, proudly claiming that the Afrikaner nation must stand together to preserve its way of life and that he would never surrender the Union of South Africa to the Britons or the Natives.\n\nThe ceremony was an extravagant affair, almost exclusively due to generous Ossewabrandwag contributions, with tens of thousands attending.

SACW.22.d:0 "In response to recent events, today in the Pretoria City Hall the provincial governors of both the Transvaal and the Orange Free State have declared their secession from the Union of South Africa, effective immediately. They have formed together the second Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek and named Hertzog as their new President.

While successful in the Orange Free State and the Transvaal, where they met little resistance and were joined by local military units, elsewhere they made minimal progress thanks to the obstruction of loyalist forces and populations. In Cape Town, militants of the Ossewabrandwag have tried to occupy the Parliament but were repulsed by the Guard and a rapidly formed militia which drove them from the city.\n\nAs a result, today in the Pretoria City Hall the provincial governors of both the Transvaal and the Orange Free State have declared their secession from the Union of South Africa, effective immediately.
