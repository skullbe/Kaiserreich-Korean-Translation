Farmers are nearly at a point of rioting, and thus addressing the crisis tops our agenda."
GRE_foreign_industry_question:0 "외국 소유의 산업?"
GRE_foreign_industry_question_desc:0 "Much of Greece's industry is owned by foreigners, mainly in Germany and Austria. With the financial crisis, many of these factories have begun to shut their doors, expecting Greece to deal with the political fallout until such a time as the economy recovers. With so many industrial workers left unpaid and out on the street, we must do something about this."
GRE_board_of_industry:0 "산업 이사회"
GRE_board_of_industry_desc:0 "A new government agency must be created in order to oversee an overhaul of some of Greece's rather outdated industrial laws and practices."

GRE_privatize_industry:0 "정부 재산 사유화"
GRE_privatize_industry_desc:0 "There are a number of government-run businesses and factories which would best work in the hands of private individuals.

GRE_nationalize_industry:0 "필수 기업 국유화"

GRE_military_conversion:0 "군수 공장 전환"
GRE_military_conversion_desc:0 "There are a number of military factories which we must consider turning over to commercial use. It means Greece will be less prepared for war in the future, but there will be no Greece if it crumbles around us thanks to the crisis."
GRE_fund_business:0 "대출"
GRE_fund_business_desc:0 "We cannot dig any deeper - the only way to bail Greece out of this crisis is to take out as many loans as we can afford, and channel that money into employment programs and funding the most promising companies willing to open new factories in Greece. It will hurt in the long run, but we have little choice."
GRE_recovery:0 "완전한 회복"

GRE_monarchist_question:0 "남겨진 왕정주의자"
GRE_monarchist_question_desc:0 "There are still many within the government, and especially the army, who yet hold loyalties to the monarchy.

GRE_king_alexandros:0 "알렉산드로스 왕"

GRE_republican_question_desc:0 "With the king now back on the throne, a question lingers regarding what should be done with those who most oppose him and advocate a return to republican rule.

GRE_empower_the_throne:0 "왕권 강화"
GRE_empower_the_throne_desc:0 "It seems Alexander has learned a thing or two in his exile and has been exerting his will on parliament more forcefully. He has garnered enough support to gain power enough to overrule the elected leaders when needed, making him far from the figurehead many assumed he would be."
GRE_king_georgios:0 "게오르기오스 왕"
GRE_king_georgios_desc:0 "A military man from an early age, Prince George is the eldest son of the late King Constantine and shall create a strong monarchy along German lines, where the King serves as a brake on the powers of parliament."

GRE_divine_mediator:0 "신성한 중재자"
GRE_divine_mediator_desc:0 "The king stands as a divinely anointed ruler, chosen by both God and the people to defend them from radicalism and instability.

GRE_christian_unions:0 "Found Christian Unions"
GRE_christian_unions_desc:0 "Founding state-endorsed unions under the leadership of priests will allow us to prevent labour disputes from getting out of hand and becoming a threat to the safety of Greece.

GRE_planned_industry_desc:0 "Unlike what many believe, agrarianism is not antithetical to a strong industrial state. Quite the opposite, in fact.

This requires heavy government intervention and control: the right industry in the right place, manned by the right people."
GRE_soc_dems:0 "Ethnikón Enotikón Kómma"

GRE_new_enterprise_desc:0 "A socialist state cannot truly be successful without creating a partnership with its private entrepreneurs and corporations.

### Events
gre.1.t:0 "제4 헬레네 공화국"
gre.1.d:0 "The years since Greece's loss in the Weltkrieg have seen little but upheaval and hardship. The loss of Crete and Macedonia to the Treaty of Salonika and crippling war debts to Austria and Germany sent King Alexander fleeing into exile as the Third Republic was declared... only to result in years of failed governments and coups until Georgios Kondylis took control in 1926 and declared himself the permanent Regent of Greece, even though its king remained in exile. Kondylis was finally overthrown and executed in 1931, leading to the Fourth Republic and the coalition government of Geórgios Papandreou which won its first election."
gre.1.a:0 "Goodness!"
gre.2.t:0 "The Challenges Ahead"
gre.2.d:0 "The new republic, which faces its next election in 1938, faces several challenges before then: most prominent is the simmering resentment towards the loss of Greek territory. Most are certain that war is coming again soon, with many groups such as the syndicalist rebels and the looming figure of Ioannis Metaxas waiting for the first moment the government makes the slightest misstep. Monarchist sentiment is also on the rise, with many demanding that another referendum be held soon to determine whether the kingdom should be restored... even if republicans fear that doing so would only plunge the nation into anarchy yet again."
gre.2.a:0 "We shall not repeat past mistakes"
gre.3.t:0 "Independence Day"
gre.3.d:0 "In 1821, Greeks rose up against the oppressive Ottoman Empire, which had occupied Greece for nearly four hundred years. Bishop Germanos of Patras boldly raised the Greek flag at the monastery of Agia Lavras, inciting the Greek revolution. While the exact date probably was not March 25th, it did occur in late March and it was gradually associated with the religious feast of the Annunciation which occurs on the same date. On the day of the Feast of the Annunciation the archangel Gabriel appeared to the maiden Mary and announced the news, she was pregnant with the divine child. Bishop Germanos chose this day to deliver a different but not unrelated message, a new spirit was about to be born in Greece."
gre.3.a:0 "A new spirit shall be born again!"
gre.4.d:0 "Independence Day is celebrated once again in [Root.GetNameDef], with crowds lining the streets in Athens and other cities, all waving the Greek flag and singing 'Ýmnos is tin Eleftherían' - the Hymn to Freedom, and the country's national anthem. Despite all the hardship the country has faced, its people are still eager to celebrate their sense of independence from those who would oppress them."
gre.4.a:0 "Hail, o hail, Liberty!"
gre.5.t:0 "Black Monday hits Greece!"
gre.5.d:0 "The rapid German economic collapse has reached our nation! Our reliance on trade with Germany and Mitteleuropean dominance of our economy has exacerbated the crisis, with many German factories being instructed to shut down. Worse, the spread of the crisis has meant a lack of markets for our agricultural exports, and already farmers are facing a crisis where almost none of them can sell their crops. We must quickly work to address this crisis, lest it grow out of hand and sow chaos throughout our nation."
gre.5.a:0 "O Theós na mas voithísei!"
gre.6.t:0 "Responding to the Crisis"
gre.6.d:0 "With the number of farmers left holding crops and nowhere to sell them, we are left with a choice: either support them for the current year and encourage them to switch away from their reliance on exports, or dig deep into our pockets and support them fully until the economic crisis has passed."
gre.6.a:0 "Help them out as much as we can"
gre.6.b:0 "Dig deep - they're the backbone of Greece"
gre.7.t:0 "Foreign-Owned Industry"
gre.7.d:0 "Almost half of our economy is owned by investors in Germany and Austria, but after Black Monday many of their mines and factories have closed down - some because they have become unprofitable but others because the investors are trying to save money or have gone bankrupt. In either case, many thousands of Greeks have been put out of work. The suggestion is that we should seize these assets, or at least the worst cases, despite the Treaty of Salonika stipulating that we cannot. The only way to prevent a backlash from either country, however, is to subsidize the investors out of our own pocket... a deeply unpopular move if we attempted it, to be sure."
gre.7.a:0 "Seize it all, no matter the repercussions"
gre.7.b:0 "Deal with the worst cases only"
gre.7.c:0 "Subsidize the investors ourselves - they'd better be grateful"
gre.8.t:0 "Greece Seizes [Root.GetAdjective] Assets"

gre.158.a:0 "He must be stopped!"
gre.159.t:0 "Metaxas Victorious"
gre.159.d:0 "We can no longer resist Metaxas and his supporters. Our forces have begun laying down their arms and surrendering en masse. It appears another free nation has fallen to tyranny."

gre.160.t:0 "We Are Alone"
gre.160.d:0 "[GRE.GetNameDefCap] is no more, and we now stand alone. This is victory, of a sort."
gre.160.a:0 "We'll take it!"
gre.200.t:0 "Diplomatic Overtures from [GRE.GetNameDef]"
gre.200.d:0 "While our relations with the Greeks have been cool at best since their rebellion from Turkish rule in the 19th century, today we received several emissaries from [GRE.GetNameDef] who are hopeful to start a new era of peace between our nations - perhaps even going so far as to eventually work out an exchange of land and people, without the need to resort to further war. For today, however, they Greeks are looking for an indication that we might be open to such talks int he future."
gre.200.a:0 "We welcome better relations with the Greeks"
gre.200.b:0 "No, we've no need for this"
gre.201.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Agrees"
gre.201.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government appears to be open to peaceful discussion with [GRE.GetNameDef], and has indicated a willingness to talk about more co-operation in the future."
gre.201.a:0 "That is a relief"
gre.202.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused"
gre.202.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has rejected our peaceful emissaries, and appears to have no interest in any further talks with [GRE.GetNameDef]."
gre.202.a:0 "So much for diplomacy"
gre.203.t:0 "A Treaty with [GRE.GetNameDef]?"
gre.203.d:0 "For several weeks now, [Root.GetAdjective] officials have been in talks with emissaries from [GRE.GetNameDef] about the possibility of a treaty of co-operation. This would mean an end to hostilities with the Greeks, and a sorting out of our differences. What the Greeks are asking for is this: we give them any states integral to their country, and they give us ours, while each of us give up any claims to other territories. We also begin an exchange of population, with Turks in [GRE.GetNameDef] coming to [Root.GetNameDef] but our much greater number of Greeks leaving for their country. In exchange, they will sign a pact of non-aggression, and we will do the same. The disruption caused by such a massive displacement of people will be considerable...but perhaps it might be worth it, in the end?"
gre.203.a:0 "We agree to their terms"
gre.203.b:0 "We agree to everything but surrendering land"
gre.203.c:0 "No, they are asking for far too much"
gre.204.t:0 "The Turks Refuse to Surrender Land"
gre.204.d:0 "After weeks of discussion, the [From.GetAdjective] government has stated it would agree to an exchange of populations between our countries, and also make a pledge of non-aggression...but under no circumstances will they turn over land we believe is rightfully ours. Is it worth agreeing to the rest of the treaty, knowing that our mutual claims could very well lead us back to war in time anyway?"
gre.204.a:0 "Then there's no deal"
gre.204.b:0 "Very well, we'll work with that"
gre.205.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused"
gre.205.d:0 "We did our best to conclude the deal, but without agreeing to exchange the territories the Greeks see no point in pursuing a treaty of non-aggression."
gre.205.a:0 "So be it!"
gre.206.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Agreed"
gre.206.d:0 "The Greeks have agreed to our modified deal. It may mean we'll end up back at each other's throats in time, but for now there will be peace...and once the disruption caused by the exchange of population is over, chances are [Root.GetNameDef] will experience far fewer internal problems caused by their presence."
gre.206.a:0 "Excellent"
gre.207.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
gre.207.d:0 "After weeks of negotiation, the [From.GetAdjective] government finally ended the talks with [Root.GetNameDef] and no treaty worked out. There were simply too many points of contention that [From.GetNameDef] was unwilling to budge on, and se we leave empty handed."
gre.207.a:0 "It was worth the attempt"
gre.208.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Agreed"
gre.208.d:0 "After weeks of negotiation, we have come to an agreement with [From.GetNameDef] on a treaty between our nations. A pledge of non-agression has already been signed, and within a month's time the exchange of populations will begin. This will mean a large number of people coming into [Root.GetNameDef]. We will need to be ready for a great deal of disruption."
gre.208.a:0 "We will gladly welcome them home"
gre.210.t:0 "The Exchange Begins"
gre.210.d:0 "The population exchange between [Root.GetNameDef] and [GRE.GetNameDef] has begun, with thousands of Turks arriving daily...but many more Greeks leaving. The disruption is worse than we imagined, and there is a considerable amount of looting occurring in the homes left behind by the Greeks. Many of the refugees are reportedly starving or becoming ill en route, considering some have no means of transportation other than to walk to [GRE.GetNameDef] on foot or to take ramshackle boats across the Aegean. Authorities are already moving in to try and keep order where they can, and ideally this will sort itself out in time."
gre.210.a:0 "It's for the best"
gre.211.d:0 "The population exchange between [turks.GetNameDef] and [GRE.GetNameDef] has begun, with thousands of Turks leaving daily...but many more Greeks arriving. The disruption is worse than we imagined, and there is a considerable amount of looting occurring in the homes left behind by the Turks.

gre.212.t:0 "Stability Restored"
gre.212.d:0 "The population exchange is now a year in the past, and finally the dust appears to have settled and the refugees that returned to [Root.GetNameDef] have acclimated to their new homes."
gre.212.a:0 "That's finally over, then?"
gre.213.t:0 "Mission from [GRE.GetNameDef]"
gre.213.d:0 "The [GRE.GetAdjective] ambassador has been in talks with [Root.GetAdjective] officials over the past several weeks, attempting to foster better relations and more mutual cooperation between our nations. While some in the government are suspicious of their motives, it does appear as if their intentions are nothing more than to foster greater peace in the region."
gre.213.a:0 "Yes, let's work more closely with the Greeks"
gre.213.b:0 "No, there's no need for this"
gre.214.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Agreed"
gre.214.d:0 "After discussions between the [Root.GetAdjective] ambassador and the [From.GetAdjective] government, they have agreed to increase ties between our nations."
gre.214.a:0 "Well done!"
gre.215.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused"
gre.215.d:0 "It appears that suspicions between the nations of the Balkans runs too deeply. The [From.GetAdjective] government listened to our ambassador and made non-committal noises of agreement...but nothing has come of it, and relations between our countries remains unchanged."
gre.215.a:0 "Too bad"
gre.216.t:0 "Greater Balkans Cooperation"
gre.216.d:0 "Our efforts to foster better relations with other countries in the Balkans has paid off - namely with greater investment in [Root.GetNameDef] and greater confidence amongst our citizens that peace will be maintained."
gre.216.a:0 "Good to hear"
gre.250.t:0 "[GRE.GetNameDefCap] Resurrects Megali Idea"
gre.250.d:0 "The Greeks have become increasingly revanchist over the last several months, making motions at resurrecting the 'Megali Idea' which aims at reclaiming ethnically Greek areas of Anatolia. They've now formally stated their intention to pursue this goal, and in so doing would be likely to drag [Root.GetNameDef] and our alliance into their war. Do we go along with it, and support them, or tell the Greeks that if they wish to chase after their lands they will do so on their own?"
gre.250.a:0 "We support them, no matter what"
gre.250.b:0 "This is unacceptable - they either desist, or they go"
gre.251.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Supports Us"
gre.251.d:0 "While some were nervous that [From.GetNameDef] would refuse to be dragged into an irredentist war with us, that has not proven to be the case. The [From.GetAdjective] government has declared their support for us, and - as our ally - will be there for whatever war we decide to pursue."
gre.251.a:0 "Excellent"
gre.252.t:0 "A Warning from [From.GetNameDef]"
gre.252.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has gotten wind of our intention to reclaim ethnically Greek lands in Anatolia, and informed us in no uncertain terms that, if we pursue this path, we will do it on our own and outside of the [From.GetAdjective] alliance."
gre.252.a:0 "Then Megali dies here"
gre.252.b:0 "Then we are on our own"
gre.253.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Leaves the [Root.GetFactionName]"
gre.253.d:0 "It seems our warning to the Greeks was heard and discarded. They have elected to abandon the [Root.GetFactionName] and will pursue their wars on their own."
gre.253.a:0 "Good luck with that!"
gre.254.t:0 "The Greeks Offer Peace"
gre.254.d:0 "We are losing the war with the Greeks - badly. They have contacted the [Root.GetAdjective] government and offered peace, in exchange for all their claimed territories. It is a hard pill to swallow, but the alternative is very likely for us to be crushed completely."
gre.254.a:0 "We must make peace while we can"
gre.254.b:0 "No - they will have to fight us to the last man"
gre.255.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses Peace"
gre.255.d:0 "It seems the Turks wish to fight us to the last man. They have turned down our offer of terms."
gre.255.a:0 "So be it!"
