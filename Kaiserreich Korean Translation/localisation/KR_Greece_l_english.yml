Still, the King can activate his emergency powers and dissolve parliament for the time being..."

greece.6.t:0 "Independence Day and the Annunciation Feast"
greece.6.d:0 "In 1821, Greeks rose up against the oppressive Ottoman Empire which had occupied Greece for nearly four hundred years. Bishop Germanos of Patras boldly raised the Greek flag at the monastery of Agia Lavras, inciting the Greek revolution. While the exact date probably was not March 25th, it did occur in late March and it was gradually associated with the religious feast of the Annunciation which occurs on the same date. On the day of the Feast of the Annunciation the archangel Gabriel appeared to the maiden Mary and announced the news: she was pregnant with the divine child. Bishop Germanos chose this day to deliver a different but not unrelated message: a new spirit was about to be born in Greece."
greece.6.a:0 "A New Spirit Shall Be Born!"
