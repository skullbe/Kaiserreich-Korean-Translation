SRI_anti_tank:0 "Anti-tank Artillery"
SRI_anti_tank_desc:0 "The armour of tanks has grown rapidly over the past several years. Both man-portable and older towed anti-tank weapons have become increasingly obsolete. To counter the growing threat of enemy armoured vehicles, we must develop new anti-tank guns."
SRI_superior_firepower:0 "Mass Fire Support"
SRI_superior_firepower_desc:0 "We shall use the industrial heart of Italy to defend the country and the revolution by focusing on superior firepower. By building just more ammunition then the enemy we shall destroy him with far more shells and bullets and save the lives of our men."

SRI_small_unit_tactics:0 "Small Unit Tactics"
SRI_small_unit_tactics_desc:0 "Larger units and bulky hierarchical structures inhibit the ability of individual groups of soldiers to take the actions necessary to achieve victory on the battlefield.

SRI_red_rocket:0 "Red Rockets"
SRI_red_rocket_desc:0 "Our reactionary enemies will do anything to hold on to their ill-gotten power. To overcome such a foe, we must employ unconventional weapons.

SRI_lighting_warfare:0 "Lightning Warfare"
SRI_lighting_warfare_desc:0 "The Red Army must be able to strike with such speed as to shatter the strategic integrity of an enemy force. The Army must be trained to exploit breakthroughs rather than maintain our own frontline – a radical departure from established doctrine."

### Events ###
socitaly.1.t:0 "The Socialist Republic of Italy"
socitaly.1.d:0 "With the French defeat and the fall of Rome in 1919, an exhausted Italy was left at the mercy of the Austrians, seemingly destined to be divided again into her old pre-unification states. Mere hours after the humiliating announcement of capitulation, enraged nationalists proclaimed a new Republic of Italy in Milan, and that all treaties signed by the House of Savoy were to be considered null and void. However, not so far away in Torino, The Socialist Republic was proclaimed just days later. Austria's plans for dividing Italy were quickly torn to pieces.\n\nAs Civil war erupted throughout the region, the Socialist Republic of Italy gained seemingly unstoppable momentum, broken only by a staunch defence of the Po by forces of the Republic of Italy and Austria; ushering in a period of deadlock. \n\nSince the ceasefire in 1920, Three Congresses have come and gone that have helped to bring the revolution throughout the region under their control, uplifting many from their previous conditions though much still remains to be done. The Italian support in creating the Third International has many looking to complete Risorgimento and reunify Italia once more."

Meanwhile, Benito Mussolini's new faction, the Unione Nazionalista, advances the new ideology of Garibaldismo, advocating for absolute state power and aggressive military expansion. The very future of the Republic hangs in the balance."

Unione Nazionalista's representative argued that it is the chairman that should be empowered."

Their representative claiming that even priests can be serve socialism as Jesus wanted. The Unione Nazionalista on the other hand roared back that Christianity is archaic and anachronistic for the modern age and that State Atheism will help break the chains of ignorance.

socitaly.11.t:0 "Stalemate in the Socialist Republic of Italy"
socitaly.11.d:0 "During the recent Congress of the Socialist Republic of Union, none of the three factions achieved a clear majority.

socitaly.19.d:0 "A number of highly-placed Catholics who have been deemed at risk for supporting the Papacy over their own government were recently rounded up by the Republican Guard today and placed in prison until such a time as they can be properly vetted. It's a move that's sure to outrage other Catholics in the republic, but should any trouble arise the presence of so many ready informants will ensure it's dealt with far more readily than it might be otherwise."

socitaly.32.t:0 "Christian Socialism?"
socitaly.32.d:0 "While the Socialist Republic of Italy is a secular republic, the question of Christian Socialism has come up.

While great progress has been made since the civil war that tore Italy apart, we must look at how to improve the economy. Two main proposals have been put forth to the Congress. The first favoured by the Unione Socialista Cristiana would focus on the various communes throughout the country and focus on decentralising the industry. The second plan put forth by the Unione Nazionalista is nearly the exact opposite. It instead would favour creating an organisation called the Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale(Institute for Industrial Reconstruction) that will organise guide the syndicates and unions to bring prosparity for the people."
