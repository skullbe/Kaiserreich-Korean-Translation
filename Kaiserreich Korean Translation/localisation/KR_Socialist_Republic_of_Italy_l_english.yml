### Focuses
SRI_fourth_congress:0 "Begin the Fourth Congress"
SRI_fourth_congress_desc:0 "The Fourth Congress of the Greater Italian Union is due to begin, where the policies of the nation will be debated and where the Social-Reformists, the Anarcho-Syndicalists, and the National Syndicalists will vie for control over the Republic."
SRI_social_reform:0 "Social-Reformists"
SRI_social_reform_desc:0 "The Social-Reforminsts under Filippo Turati have taken power, pushing the nation onto a more moderate path."
SRI_agriculture_act:0 "Italian Agriculture Act"
SRI_agriculture_act_desc:0 "A central promise of the Social-Reformists is to reform southern farmlands, improving their overall yield and giving the economy a much-needed jolt. It's also expected the move will result in a large migration of people to the capital as farms stop relying primarily on heavy labour."
SRI_social_programs:0 "Fund Social Programs"
SRI_social_programs_desc:0 "The Social-Reformist approach to dealing with widespread corruption and crime in the Republic is to increase funding to education and social programs. It's a slow way to address the issue, perhaps, but in the long run they are determined that bettering the lot of the poorest Italians will have the greatest impact."
SRI_focus_defence:0 "Focus on Defence"
SRI_focus_defence_desc:0 "The Republic should not be a nation focused on offence, but rather on defence and peaceful reform. If reunion comes with the north, it will not be best served if it comes at the hands of those seen as brutal conquerors."
SRI_anarco_synd:0 "Anarcho-Syndicalists"
SRI_anarco_synd_desc:0 "The Anarcho-Syndicalists under Palmiro Togliatti have maintained their hold on power after the Congress, keeping the nation on a steady path towards true syndicalism."
SRI_industry_act:0 "Italian Industrial Act"
SRI_industry_act_desc:0 "Industry in the Republic can, at best, be described as anaemic. Laws must be passed to reform the burden on corporations and give the trade unions better ability to aid the companies they work for rather than to hamper them. We must all work together for a brighter future!"
SRI_republican_guard:0 "Fund the Republican Guard"
SRI_republican_guard_desc:0 "The Anarcho-Syndicalists understand that corruption and crime are rife throughout the Republic. The most efficient way to deal with this is to increase funding to the Republican Guard, and to pass laws that clear the way for them to better enforce order throughout the country."
SRI_popular_army:0 "A Popular Army"
SRI_popular_army_desc:0 "The best way to push forward is to ensure the republic's army is both efficient and well-trained. Quality is better than quantity, but faster training will also ensure more soldiers are available in the future."
SRI_national_synd:0 "National Syndicalists"
SRI_national_synd_desc:0 "The National Syndicalists under Benito Mussolini have taken power, pushing the nation onto a more extremist and militaristic path."
SRI_heavy_industry_act:0 "Fund Heavy Industry"
SRI_heavy_industry_act_desc:0 "The National Syndicalists believe in improving the economy through sheer brute force - directly funding the expansion of heavy industry throughout the Republic, with an equal focus on military infrastructure as well as consumer goods."
SRI_secret_police:0 "Expand the Secret Police"
SRI_secret_police_desc:0 "War with the crime families is fully expected, and the best way to combat them is to know what they'll do before they do. This means the establishment of a large and efficient secret police to keep tabs on not only the people but also the Republican Guard which has been plagued with corruption of its own."
SRI_prepare_for_war:0 "Prepare For War"
SRI_prepare_for_war_desc:0 "The call must go out to the people of the Republic - prepare for war with the north, and indeed all of the Republic's enemies. Unity and greatness will only be achieved through blood, but it will all be for the righteous cause of restoring Italian honour."
SRI_center_on_sicily:0 "Centre on Sicily"
SRI_center_on_sicily_desc:0 "Sicily is the true heart of the Republic, and in a way its greatest weakness due to its vulnerable coastline. Its ports must be fortified and the island prepared to be the last line of defence should the war ever turn against the Republic. We will hold out on the island, if it truly comes to that."
SRI_center_on_capital:0 "Centre on Naples"
SRI_center_on_capital_desc:0 "The capital city of Naples is our greatest jewel, and since it is so close to the border we must take extra precaution to fortify it from attacks by both land and sea."
SRI_no_center:0 "Fortify the Border"
SRI_no_center_desc:0 "There is no true centre of the Republic's defence, and we must focus on ensuring the northern papists never cross the border into the south. That is our only realistic path to success."
SRI_destabilize_north:0 "Destabilise the North"
SRI_destabilize_north_desc:0 "There are socialists and syndicalist supporters who quietly remain in the Federation. We must reach out to them and fund their efforts, and in doing so hamper the north's ability to defend itself when the time comes for us to strike."
SRI_suppress_catholics:0 "Suppress Catholics"
SRI_suppress_catholics_desc:0 "The one true issue we face is that we are a nation of faithful Catholics who may question their true loyalties when it comes time to opposing the papacy. Most realize the north has been comprised by its political aims, true, but we must seek out any of those who could turn against us when the time comes to act."

SRI_attack_north:0 "Initiate Risorgimento"
SRI_attack_north_desc:0 "The rival papists of the north are exposed and weak! Now is the time to strike them down and unite Italy!"
SRI_peaceful_reunion:0 "Propose Peaceful Reunion"

SRI_incorporate_north:0 "Incorporate the North"
SRI_incorporate_north_desc:0 "Italy has been reunited under a single government, from the Alps all the way to Sicily in the south. While this is a time to rejoice, there is much work still to be done to organise those accustomed to living under tyranny."
SRI_irridentism:0 "Irredentist Path"

SRI_claim_malta:0 "Claim Malta"
SRI_claim_malta_desc:0 "Malta is a small nation, it's true, but it lies in a strategic position off our southern coast. As long as someone else holds it, we will always be vulnerable to attack."
SRI_claim_libya:0 "Claim Libya"
SRI_claim_libya_desc:0 "The Libyan coast was lost to us after the Great war. Today, however, this land is ripe for the taking."

SRI_entreat_mafia_desc:0 "While it might be unthinkable to some, we must entreat with the organised crime families - secretly, if need be - and call a truce in order to give us some breathing room to grow. We will deal with them in time, but for now we simply need peace."
SRI_war_with_mafia:0 "War on the Crime Families"

### Events ###

socitaly.1.t:0 "The Socialist Republic of Italy"
socitaly.1.d:0 "At the end of the Weltkrieg, Italy was in disarray. It collapsed into chaos, with the victorious Central Powers diving up the once proud nation. While the northern half of Italy would become occupied by the Austrian Empire, the southern half would become the reformed Kingdom of Two Sicilies, with an Austrian puppet upon the throne. This decision was vastly unpopular amongst the south Italian peasantry, leading to a series of peasant revolts and uprisings. Soon, Anarcho-Syndicalist thinkers fleeing from the Austrian occupation in the north arrived in Naples and began to build support for a revolution. In February 1921, Palmiro Togliatti and Amadeo Bordiga led a revolution. The Austrians were unable to halt the Syndicalist tide, and after two months of civil war the Syndicalists triumphed and the Socialist Republic of Italy was declared. \n\n Unfortunately, the Republic's troubles had merely just begun. Power struggles and purges ensued, and southern Italy was still in shambles from both the civil war and the Weltkrieg. Now, 15 years since the Republic's founding, the nation is only just barely starting to rebuild and industrialise. Hampered by the Italian Federation to the North and the insidious organised crime families that has grown over the past few years within their own borders, the nation is beset by challenges and dangers on all sides."
socitaly.1.a:0 "Forward!"

socitaly.2.t:0 "Fourth Congress of the Greater Italian Union"
socitaly.2.d:0 "Today, the Fourth Congress of the Greater Italian Union begins. The various factions of the Congress will debate economic, internal, and military policies. The Anarcho-Syndicalists seek to push Orthodox Syndicalism, advancing the current policies of the congress, while the Social-Reformists desire a government that helps the people, with an expansion of social programs. Meanwhile, Benito Mussolini's new faction, the National-Syndicalists, advances the new ideology of Totalism, advocating for absolute state power and aggressive military expansion. The very future of the Republic hangs in the balance."
socitaly.2.a:0 "Let's get to work!"

socitaly.3.t:0 "Day 1: Economic Policy"
socitaly.3.d:0 "The first order of business is the economic policy of the Republic. The Social-Reformists advocate for moderate industrialisation, whilst also expanding Italy's agriculture. The Anarcho-Syndicalists argue for industrialisation, and Mussolini's National-Syndicalists demand nothing short of total and immediate industrialisation."
socitaly.3.a:0 "We must expand both our industry and our agriculture"
socitaly.3.b:0 "We should focus on industrialisation"
socitaly.3.c:0 "Nothing short of total industrialisation will suffice!"

socitaly.4.t:0 "Day 2: Internal Policy"
socitaly.4.d:0 "While discussing internal security, the organised crime problem emerged as the dominant topic of debate. The factions of the party are staunchly divided on how to approach the issue. The Social-Reformists wish to increase social spending to help the population in affected areas in hopes of reducing crime family authority, whilst the Anarcho-Syndicalists wish to empower the Republican Guard to fight off the criminals. The National-Syndicalists take things a step further, arguing for expansive secret police services and surveillance in order to bring this threat -- and any other -- to a swift end."
socitaly.4.a:0 "Focus on social spending and helping the people!"
socitaly.4.b:0 "Increase funding and empower the Republican Guard!"
