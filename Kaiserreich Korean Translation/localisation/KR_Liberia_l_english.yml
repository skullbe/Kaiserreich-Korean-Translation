lib.1.t:0 "Liberian Introduction"
lib.1.d:0 "First established in 1821 by the American Colonisation Society as a homeland for freed African-American slaves (who either wanted to return to Africa to start a new life there or were forced to leave the United States), Liberia declared its independence in July 1847 - albeit the American government continues to exercise a great deal of influence in its internal affairs. Since its foundation, the country's political life has been dominated by the minority Americo-Liberians, descendants of the freed American slaves, which has brought the government in conflict with the several African native peoples of the area. These conflicts reached a peak in 1929, when a commission from the American government started investigating charges of slavery and forced labour involving the Liberian elite and several US mining and forestry interests. While trade of key raw materials with the US continues to be the main source of revenue for the Liberian government, the weak state of the American economy over the past decade has put the tiny country in jeopardy. The current political turmoil in North America, combined with the expansionist tendencies of National France and Mittelafrika, plus the possibility of a new round of turmoil by the largely disenfranchised native population, can either challenge the current political arrangement in Liberia, or cause the end of this republic altogether."

The natives are denied voting rights, while American-owned companies explore their workforce in near-slavery conditions. Some senators are calling for proposals giving more rights for the indigenous folk."
