ARG_Consolidate_Buenos_Aires_Capital_Region_desc:0 "Even though the capital was the first city to fall to the boots of the LP and the ARA, Buenos Aires is a megalopolis, spanning from the Tigre river to the old city of Berazategui, creating a huge problem for us, since various cells of loyalists to the old government still remain scattered throughout the region, thwarting thusfar all attempts by our forces to eradicate them."
ARG_Expand_the_Gendarmeria:0 "Found the Gendarmeria"
ARG_Expand_the_Gendarmeria_desc:0 "To better control the discontent provinces and to secure a rapid response force should the situation escalate, we should consider the creation of an 'Argentinean National Gendarmerie', placed directly under the defense minister's commands, to crack down on rebelling provinces."

ARG_Control_the_Railroads:0 "Control the Railroads"
ARG_Control_the_Railroads_desc:0 "All railways in Argentina lead to Buenos Aires which places us in the unique position to quickly lash out and quell forces rallying across the country.

ARG_March_on_Cordoba_desc:0 "The province of Cordoba has always had trouble alligning with the views of the capital, Buenos Aires.

ARG_Consolidate_Mendoza:0 "Consolidate Mendoza"
ARG_Consolidate_Mendoza_desc:0 "Famous for its wine production, the region of Mendoza is a key economic and strategic area for our nation, considering the largest and safest mountainous passage towards Chile lies there, and thus has to be brought back under our control at all costs."

ARG_Purge_Socialist_Remnants_desc:0 "Even though almost all socialist sympathisers fled South after the FOP proclaimed its independence, some have remained amongst us waiting for the time to backstab us abd finish what the FOP started, giving us the perfect excuse to eradicate dissidents amongst the opposition with national security in mind."

ARG_Eradicate_Loyalist_Resistance_desc:0 "As our grasp on the nation becomes stronger by the day, there are still those who see our regime as an offence to Argentinian democracy and Argentinean values, and who plot in the shadows to overthrow us.

ARG_Fall_of_Tucuman:0 "Fall of Tucuman"
ARG_Fall_of_Tucuman_desc:0 "Tucuman is not a key industrial center in our nation by any stretch, but it's a city held dear by Argentinean patriots. It's the city where our declaration of independence from Spain was finally signed, and where our country was born. Now, the very same city shall bear witness of a national rebirth when we finally take control over it."
ARG_Corrientes_Campaign:0 "Start the Corrientes Campaign" 
ARG_Corrientes_Campaign_desc:0 "Tensions with the Paraguayans have forced us to be extra careful in handling this province and failing to do so may provoke Paraguayan aggression, especially in our time of weakness.

ARG_Political_Dominance:0 "Complete Political Dominance"
ARG_Political_Dominance_desc:0 "Opposition is treason to the Republic and only slows us down in these trying times.

ARG_Stability_on_the_streets_desc:0 "Even though the main force of the LP has been defeated, supporters of the movement are not willing to give in so easily and have openly challenged their rivals on the streets of Buenos Aires.

ARG_Power_of_Capital:0 "Power of Capital"
ARG_Power_of_Capital_desc:0 "Argentina has had, since our nation was born, a meteoric rise to the top amongst some of the wealthiest nations in the world. The unpaid debts the British left after their collapse and the subsequent rebellion by the FOP may have delayed us, but not it shall not stop us in our way towards prosperity! After all, money makes the world go round and Argentina is part of this world."
ARG_Attract_Foreign_Investement:0 "Attract Foreign Investement"
ARG_Attract_Foreign_Investement_desc:0 "We lack the capital and technical know-how to fully develop our industrial prowess and we should thus search for foreign assistance and attract ventures by relaxing some of the industrial laws."

ARG_Church_Ties:0 "Church Ties"
ARG_Church_Ties_desc:0 "Faith is a key pillar of Argentinian society and our ties with the church are vital to stay in power. Encouraging their developement projects and allowing them near unlimited freedom will surely prove to be a wise decision."

ARG_Five_Year_Plan:0 "First Five Year Plan"
ARG_Five_Year_Plan_desc:0 "Even though we persued rapid industrialisation in the last decade to cope with the loss of British imports, our economy is not on par with our European examples.

ARG_Grants_for_the_Universidad_de_Buenos_Aires_desc:0 "With the recent events regarding the LP takeover, old rivalries between the Capital and the interior cities have been revived, and now the people of the provinces of Mendoza, San Juan and San Luis are unhappy that they're forced to move to Buenos Aires in order to get higher education. We consider their demands as fair, and as such, we have decided to found the 'Cuyo National University'."
ARG_YPF_Expansion:0 "YPF Expansion"
ARG_YPF_Expansion_desc:0 "Now that we control the Patagonia, we shall let the state owned 'Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales' expand their operations there.

Considering his experience in engineering, we believe that he can lead YPF to new heights, so we shall name him 'Director General' of YPF."
ARG_Economic_Control_over_Argentina:0 "Economic Control over Argentina"

ARG_Spread_out_Military_Production:0 "Dispersed Military Production"
ARG_Spread_out_Military_Production_desc:0 "Centralising our Military production could prove to be detrimental to our nation in times of war since the loss of our industrial centers would mean the end of Argentina.

## Military ##
argmil.10.t:0 "Lack of funding in the Navy"
argmil.10.d:0 "Recent governement adjustements to the military budget have brought our naval spending down to dangerous levels. While this has greatly empowered the military and the developement of new landbased weaponry, officers from the ARA have warned us that further pulling down the budget could have dangerous consequences on the prowess of our fleet."
argmil.10.a:0 "Troubling"

argmil.11.t:0 "Trouble in the Dockyards"
argmil.11.d:0 "Originating from the lack of new governement contracts, some of our dockyards have been forced to close down, firing hundreds of naval workers. Social tensions between the government and the Naval Unions were already high and the recent crisis may have only worsened the relations."
argmil.11.a:0 "Troubling"

argmil.12.t:0 "Explosion in Puerto Belgrano"
argmil.12.d:0 "During a routine inspection of one of our destroyers in the port, an explosion rocked the ship killing dozens of sailors and severly damaging the vessel. While official state propaganda reported the incident as a syndicalist terrorist attack, the real perpetrator is a lack of maintenance of our ever growing fleet and the incapacity of our engineering staff."
argmil.12.a:0 "Troubling"

argmil.13.t:0 "Fighting in Buenos Aires"
argmil.13.d:0 "Increasing aversion between the military branches of our army came to blows last night in Buenos Aires when a group of drunk ARA sailors encountered a military patrol. Arguments surrounding the recent budget cuts for the navy led to a fistfight between the two parties and was quickly followed up by further soldiers joining in. Gendarmería eventually broke up the fights and placed the perpetrators in custody but all help came too late for one of the sailors who died of his injuries 3 hours later in the hospital."
argmil.13.a:0 "Troubling"

argmil.20.t:0 "Lack of funding in the Army"
argmil.20.d:0 "Recent governement adjustements to the military budget have brought our Army spending down to dangerous levels. While this has greatly empowered the ARA and the developement of new war ships, officers from the Army have warned us that further pulling down the budget could have dangerous consequences on the prowess of our land forces and could open us up to foreign invasions."
argmil.20.a:0 "Troubling"

argmil.21.t:0 "Rampant Desertion in the Army"
argmil.21.d:0 "Worsening living standards in the Barracks and lowered wages of our soldiers have caused many to abandon the armed forces and return to their families to support them in the wake of the economic crisis. Military Police and Gendarmería are tasked with tracking down the offendors but have as of now not been able to make a noticeable difference."
argmil.21.a:0 "Troubling"

argmil.22.t:0 "Lack of Military Steel"
argmil.22.d:0 "New orders by the ARA have swallowed up all of our steel reserves and are putting orders for the land forces on the backburner. Tanks, planes and even machine guns have all been forced to lower their production to accomodate the lowered reserves and are making it hard for our army to stay up to date and fully equipped."
argmil.22.a:0 "Troubling"

argmil.23.t:0 "Lack of Skilled Officers"
argmil.23.d:0 "Lowered wages and better prospectives in the ARA have made many of our young potential officers turn away from the land forces and instead follow a career in the Navy. This braindrain of new talent is weighing hard on the aging corps and could potentially impact our capacity to lead our troops against the enemies."
argmil.23.a:0 "Troubling" 

## War in the Southern Cone ##
southern.1.t:0 "Intervention in the Argentine-Chilean war?"
southern.1.d:0 "Argentina has kicked off the Argentine-Chilean war by invading the FOP rebels in Patagonia. Since they are aware that we hold claims on various territories of Chile, they have requested us to support them in the fight and be rewarded with our claims should our alliance win."
southern.1.a:0 "Attack Chile!"
southern.1.b:0 "We seek no conflict"

southern.2.t:0 "Peru joins on our side!"
southern.2.d:0 "To support us in the fight against the despicable syndicalists and their red cronies in Chile, Peru has also declared war on Chile and pledged their full support for our cause."
southern.2.a:0 "Hurray!"

southern.3.t:0 "Peru stays neutral!"
southern.3.d:0 "Unwilling to risk Peruvian lives in the war against Chile, their governement has denied our request and has declared itself neutral in the conflict"

southern.4.t:0 "Intervention in the Argentine-Chilean war?"
southern.4.d:0 "Argentina has kicked off the Argentine-Chilean war by invading the FOP rebels in Patagonia. Being occupied in the South with the insurgents, this has presented us with the perfect opportunity to retake the Chaco Austral!"
southern.4.a:0 "Attack!"
southern.4.b:0 "We would rather not anger Argentina"

southern.5.t:0 "Paraguay invades!"

southern.5.a:0 "Traitors!"

southern.6.t:0 "Intervention in the Argentine-Paraguayan war?"
southern.6.d:0 "Argentina has kicked off the Argentine-Chilean war by invading the FOP rebels in Patagonia which was promptly followed by a declaration of war by the Paraguayans. Since they are aware that we hold claims on various territories of Paraguay and Chile, they have requested us to support them in the fight and be rewarded with our claims should our alliance win."
southern.6.a:0 "Attack Paraguay!"
southern.6.b:0 "We shall attack Paraguay AND Chile!"
southern.6.c:0 "We seek no conflict"

southern.7.t:0 "Bolivia joins on our side!"
southern.7.d:0 "To support us in the fight against the despicable syndicalists and their red cronies in Chile, Bolivia has also declared war on Chile and Paraguay, pledging their full support for our cause."
southern.7.a:0 "Hurray!"

southern.8.t:0 "Bolivia remains neutral"
southern.8.d:0 "Weary of losing yet another war to the tiny nation of Paraguay after their humiliating defeat, Bolivia has proclaimed its neutrality in the conflict and has pledged to support neither side."
southern.8.a:0 "Most unfortunate!"

southern.61.t:0 "Intervention in the Chilean-Argentinian war?"
southern.61.d:0 "With war roaring its ugly head on our continent once more, the socialist nations of FOP and Chile find themselves pitted against the autocratic regime in Argentina. We have recently seen the virtues of the revolution as well and if we are willing to survive in a world hell bent in destroying socialism, we should assist our Southern brothers before the flame lit by the proletariat is extinguished by the Iron Fist of Argentina."
southern.61.a:0 "To arms!"
southern.61.b:0 "We can not risk our fragile stability"

southern.71.t:0 "Bolivia joins on our side!"
southern.71.d:0 "To support us in the fight against the despicable authoritarians of the east and their German cronies, Bolivia has also declared war on Argentina, pledging their full support for our cause."

southern.9.t:0 "Fall of Chile"
southern.9.d:0 "As the last cells crumble under our might, the Chilean war machine has finally been forced to give up and the governement surrendered at 4PM, transferring all power over to us."
southern.9.a:0 "Establish a puppet regime!"

southern.91.t:0 "Fall of Chile"
southern.91.d:0 "As Argentinian boots march through Santiago while last pockets of resistance throughout the nation are being cleaned up, our nation is forced to give up the fight as well. While some claim that we should continue till the better end, the population has grown weary of war and public opinion is in favour of a quick end to the conflict."
southern.91.a:0 "Surrender to Argentina"
southern.91.b:0 "We'll show those bastards what a real syndie can do!"

southern.10.t:0 "Fall of Paraguay"
southern.10.d:0 "As the last defenders are driven out of Ascuncion, the Paraguayan governement has conceded defeat and accepted our harsh demands. All of Paraguay will be annexed into Argentina and a military governement will be placed in charge of the region until further notice."
southern.10.a:0 "Cede the Chaco Boreal to Bolivia"
southern.10.b:0 "All of Paraguay belongs to us!"

southern.11.t:0 "Argentina refuses to cede Chaco Boreal"
southern.11.d:0 "Even though we carried their pathetic force through the bloody war, the Argentinians have the guts to refuse returning the Chaco Boreal to its rightful owner. Our populace is rightfully furious and are clamouring the governement to press our claims, by war if necessary."
southern.11.a:0 "Death to Argentina!"
southern.11.b:0 "They do have a bigger army..."

## Foreign ##
argfor.100.t:0 "Argentina offers a Pact"
argfor.100.d:0 "Increasing power of the socialists on our continent has left Argentina vulnerable. To combat this threat, they have proposed a defensive alliance between our two nations to steer off possible incursions by our mutual enemies."

argfor.200.t:0 "Treaty of Lima"

argfor.300.t:0 "Peru refuses to help"
argfor.300.d:0 "The Peruvian governement has announced that they will not protect us against the Chilese and has refused to further discuss the matter."
argfor.300.a:0 "We'll do it without them then!"

argfor.1.t:0 "Buenos Aires-Lima Pact"
argfor.1.d:0 "As the Brazilian behemoth keeps building up and gearing itself for war, the small nations of South America should bond together and prevent being picked off one by one. Therefore Argentina has proposed an alliance between our two nations to stand together should war arrive."

argfor.3.a:0 "We'll do it without them then!"

argfor.4.t:0 "Argentina requests Assistance"
argfor.4.d:0 "Locked in an unevitable confrontation with the FOP in Patagonia, Argentina is dedicated to purging the red threat from the continent as quickly as possible. To achieve this, they have come knocking on our door to ask for assistance in the fight as Chile is set to intervene on the behalf of the FOP. This gives us the opportunity to take back the coastline we so desire and put the Chilese in their place. Frictions with Argentina however aren't fully resolved yet and the Yacuiba region could be used an argument should we no longer be an asset to Argentinian Expansion."
argfor.4.a:0 "Agree to assist"
argfor.4.b:0 "Refuse the offer"

argfor.5.t:0 "Bolivia intervenes!"

argfor.7.t:0 "Volunteers to Rome"
argfor.7.d:0 "The Holy See is under siege by the most decripit human beings on the planet, the godless socialists of the Internationale. All that now stands against the red tide is the brave Papal garison and their Italian ally. Thousands of young Argentine men however have expressed their support for the Pope and are leaving our shores to fight the evil abroad. The Governement has not yet made a clear statement regarding the situation but has seen its hand forced if it wants to keep the furious masses under control."
argfor.7.a:0 "Allow the Volunteers to figh"
argfor.7.b:0 "Organise a propaganda campaign to rouse the masses in favour of the Pope"

argfor.8.t:0 "Argentine Volunteers arrive in Rome"

argfor.9.t:0 "Argentina wants to join the Reichspakt"
argfor.9.d:0 "After Carles was deposed and the GOU stepped in to assume control, they have followed a German friendly approach to Foreign Policy. With war brewing across our continent and thousands of Germans dying to Communard weapons, they have offered their support in the war and expressed their desire to formally join the alliance."
argfor.9.a:0 "Accept them"
argfor.9.b:0 "We don't need their help"

argfor.91.t:0 "Argentina wants to join the Reichspakt"
argfor.91.d:0 "Large interests in keeping our nation and more importantly our economy afloat have prompted the Argentinian regime to look beyond their own continent and have prompted them to apply for membership in the Reichspakt, our military alliance. With war brewing across our continent and thousands of Germans dying to Communard weapons, they have offered their support in the war and expressed their desire to formally join the alliance."
argfor.91.a:0 "Accept them"
argfor.91.b:0 "We don't need their help"

argfor.92.t:0 "Argentina wants to join the Entente"
argfor.92.d:0 "Large interests in keeping our nation and more importantly our economy afloat have prompted the Argentinian regime to look beyond their own continent and have prompted them to apply for membership in the Entente. With war brewing across Europe and thousands of our children dying to Communard weapons, they have offered their support in the war and expressed their desire to formally join the alliance."
argfor.92.a:0 "Accept them"
argfor.92.b:0 "We don't need their help"

argfor.10.t:0 "Germany accepts our offer"

argfor.102.a:0 "To Arms!"

argfor.11.t:0 "Germany refuses our offer"
argfor.11.d:0 "Surely the age of the Kaiser must have played a part in their decision making as our offer to assist them in the war was brutely refused, with their minister questioning the capacity of our armed forces."
argfor.11.a:0 "We will remain neutral"

argfor.112.t:0 "Canada refuses our offer"
argfor.112.d:0 "Surely the hubris of their King must have played a part in their decision making as our offer to assist them in the war was brutely refused, with their minister questioning the capacity of our armed forces."
argfor.112.a:0 "We will remain neutral"

argfor.12.t:0 "Immigrants from the United States"
argfor.12.d:0 "As their homeland devolves in civil war and thousands die on the streets of the once great American nation for a defunct ideology, swarms of refugees from the States have departed from the East Coast setting sail for our nation. For years we have upheld a policy of open immigration and have actively attracted foreigners. Accepting refugees from the USA however could have unforeseen diplomatic implications and the rate at which they keep flowing in is putting a strain on our nation."
argfor.12.a:0 "Increase fees for entry"
argfor.12.b:0 "Encourage American Immigration"
argfor.12.c:0 "Close the border for American citizens"
 
argfor.13.t:0 "Victory on the Rio Negro!"
argfor.13.d:0 "The northern government now demands that we withdraw from the river after recent border tensions escalated between forces of the Argentinian Army and the FOP militias. Even though we may not have gained any territorial concessions in the struggle, the action has been a great boost to our morale as our people realise that the enemy is not prepared for a full invasion."
argfor.13.a:0 "Onwards to Final Victory!" 
 
argfor.14.t:0 "Argentina offers 'protection'" 
argfor.14.d:0 "As a vulture circles above its dying prey waiting for the right opportunity, so has Argentina closely watched as Brazil underwent major ideological changes. Unfit to protect us any longer and looking to even strike us first and reintegrate our proud nation, Brazil has become too dangerous to be left unopposed. Therefore Argentina has proposed that they protect us from any harm caused by them...at a cost."
argfor.14.a:0 "We have no other choice"
argfor.14.b:0 "We can defend ourselves"

argfor.15.t:0 "Uruguay refuses our proposal!"
argfor.15.d:0 "Trusting in their sacred neutrality, the Uruguayan government has refused our offer and told our diplomats that they will fend for themselves should war reach their nation."
argfor.15.a:0 "Respect their neutrality"
argfor.15.b:0 "Enforce our 'protection'" 

argfor.16.t:0 "Military Coup in Argentina!"
argfor.16.d:0 "Continued hesitation to solve the FOP crisis has once again thrown the nation into chaos as military cliques have united to assert control over the nation. Vicious struggles in Buenos Aires, Cordoba and various other cities throughout the nation are still going on but it looks like our governement has once again fallen. Fullfilling their promises of strong and direct leadership, the new military governement has immediately declared war upon the FOP to once and for all end the crisis."
argfor.16.a:0 "Oh no!"
 
## Immigration ##
argim.1.t:0 "Immigration Report 1936"
argim.1.d:0 "Due to the collapse of the world economy in the wake of the Black Monday disaster and the rising tensions all over Europe, large swathes of immigrants have decided to cross the pond and search their fortune in our nation. With the USA slowly drifting into chaos, it comes to no surprise that many of these immigrants have chosen our nation as their primary destination where they have been freely accepted as ordaned by our constitution."

argim.3.t:0 "Immigration Report 1938"
argim.3.d:0 "Another year has passed and another statistic been drafted to detail the immigration to our nation. Rising tensions across the globes have once again brought in a lot of refugees from Europe albeit fewer than last year."

## Black Monday ##
argbla.1.t:0 "Black Monday hits the nation"
argbla.1.d:0 "When the German market opened this morning and the stocks suddenly started plummeting, our nation was one of the first to be hit by the wave. In response to the Berlin stock exchange, the Bolsa de Comercio de Buenos Aires collapsed as well causing even more trouble for Carles who is barely holding on to power."
argbla.1.a:0 "Argentina is thrown into a spiral of bad luck!"

argbla.2.t:0 "Closure of the Bolsa de Comercio?"
argbla.2.d:0 "With stocks continuing to plummet and investors all around the nation panicking, we could close the stock exchange and demand the banks to refuse paying out desperate citizens. This will buy us some more time to fix the disaster while we are focusing on political affairs but will surely not be appreciated by our population."
argbla.2.a:0 "Close it!"
argbla.2.b:0 "The Free Market will fix this!"

argbla.3.t:0 "Close the currency board?"
argbla.3.d:0 "For most of our history, the currency board has tied the Peso to a gold standard where an organ called the Caja de Conversión was tasked with maintaining the value of our currency. With stocks plummeting and Germany taking decisive action to soften the blow, our exports have lost their competitive edge and are going to be struggling to compete with cheap Eastern European and domestic products. Therefore a proposal was offered to close the currency board and abandon the gold standard, letting the peso devaluate and making our products therefore competitive again."
argbla.3.a:0 "Close the board"
argbla.3.b:0 "Keep the board open"

argbla.31.t:0 "Exports are collapsing"
argbla.31.d:0 "Due to increading competition from Europe and other parts of the world, our products have completely lost their competitive edge on the German market causing thousands of our citizens to lose their jobs due to the bankruptcy of many of our major companies."
argbla.31.a:0 "Try to soften the blow"

argbla.4.t:0 "Peso spirals downwards"
argbla.4.d:0 "With political insecurity in Argentina and massive economic troubles in the German Empire, the Peso keeps spiralling downwards forcing many of our old and powerful companies to close down and lay of thousands of workers. Government plans to intervene and save those without jobs are being drafted up but in the meanwhile the situation goes from bad to worse."
argbla.4.a:0 "Strong intervention is a necessity!"

argbla.5.t:0 "Unrest in Cordoba and Mendoza"
argbla.5.d:0 "Caused by the economic recession and feeding of the political insecurity in our nation, thousands of jobless citizens in the industrial cities of Cordoba and Mendoza have flocked to the streets to demand the governement to step in and fix the crisis. Since our control over these cities is still uncontested, local police forces loyal to the army are not intervening on our behalf in an attempt to fan the flames of resistance against Carles and his shaky regime."
argbla.5.a:0 "Send a strongly worded letter"

argbla.6.t:0 "Revising our Exports"
argbla.6.d:0 "After the victory by the Central Powers in the Weltkrieg and the fading importance of the British Empire, Argentina slowly started adjusting itself to the new world order and increased its exports to Germany. This turned out to be the correct choice as 1925 brought with it the collapse of the British Empire and the trade network it had established. As Argentinas prime export partner and the supplier of much of our needed goods, the governement was forced to start a large scale industrialisation program leading to rising social tensions and a couple rough years.\n\n German investements and the increasing importance of our agricultural products turned the situation back around in the thirties, leading to an economic boom and the establishement of Argentina as an economic powerhouse on the continent. The crash of the German market however and the return of protectionism to the nation, have catastrophically impacted our economy and severly hampered our exports. A new trade agreement will have to be signed so we can get a guarantee from the German Empire that they'll keep importing our goods."
argbla.6.a:0 "Send the proposal"

argbla.7.t:0 "Argentinian Trade Delegation"
argbla.7.d:0 "As one of our largest import partners, the struggling republic of Argentina has reached out to our trade ministry begging us to make an exception on the increased tariffs we imposed on non-Mitteleuropan nations. Since their economy is virtually entirely dependent on us, we could put the squeeze on them and try to force them into signing a less favourable agreement.\n\nShould they however take this opportunity to shift their interests to the Entente, it would cut us off from their vital agricultural exports which could give our rivals in the Entente an advantage in the Americas."
argbla.7.a:0 "We need their loyalty!"
argbla.7.b:0 "What's a few extra reichsmarks between friends?"

argbla.71.t:0 "Germany agrees to our terms"
argbla.71.d:0 "Whether it is out of benevolence or a desire to expand their influence on the South American continent, Germany has eagerly agreed to our terms and made an exception for Argentinian products in their Black Monday trade arrangements."
argbla.71.a:0 "We are grateful"

argbla.72.t:0 "Germany imposes harsher terms"
argbla.72.d:0 "Aware of our fragile situation and not willing to drag their own recovery down to assist us, the German trade ministry has demanded we lower the prices of our processed meat exports or face consequences by receiving higher prices on steel, tools and consumer goods.\n\n We are however not obliged to follow these demands and could perhaps strike a deal with the Entente to reduce our dependence on Germany although the Islas Malvinas issue has not fully been resolved yet and could prove to be a British bargaining chip."
argbla.72.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept"
argbla.72.b:0 "Maybe there is an alternative solution..."

argbla.73.t:0 "Argentina comes to bargain"
argbla.73.d:0 "Severly hit by Black Monday and forced by Germany to swallow a tough pill to save their economy, the government has come to us to strike a new trade agreement. Their vast agrarian exports have made them a key player on the global market and years of industrialisation after the fall of our empire have succesfully turned them into a valuable asset for our trade network and possibly alliance.\n\nHowever, they also stole the Falkland Islands in our moment of weakness and this is an insult that doesn't sit well with the public at home. Should we force them to return the islands we would gain a massive amount of support from our followers but could risk an end to possible trade relations with the Republic."
argbla.73.a:0 "We can use all the help we can get"
argbla.73.b:0 "The Falkland Islands are British!"

argbla.74.t:0 "Canada accepts our proposal"
argbla.74.d:0 "Whether it is out of benevolence or a desire to expand their influence on the South American continent, Canada has eagerly agreed to our terms and made an exception for Argentinian products in their trade arrangements, giving us access to a worldwide market of opportunity."
argbla.74.a:0 "We are grateful"

argbla.75.t:0 "Canada demands the Falkland Islands back"
argbla.75.d:0 "While Canada would be willing to revise their broken treaties with us after the 1925 debacle, they have one simple demand before agreeing to discuss possible trade arrangements: The Islas Malvinas have to be returned to British control at once or there will be no possible deal, now or in the future. Not only are the islands an important naval facility in our fight agains the FOP, returning the islands would cause massive outrage on the homefront which we don't need with the already fragile state of our regime.\n\n Inhabitants of the Islands have not been asked whose side they are on but it goes without saying that they have full faith in our capacity to make the right decision."
argbla.75.a:0 "On second thought, the Germans weren't so bad..."
argbla.75.b:0 "Who cares about some sheep rocks anyway?"

argbla.76.t:0 "Argentina accepts our demands!"
argbla.76.d:0 "Realising that they have no other choice but to bow to our demands, the Argentinian governement has officialy signed the new trade agreement granting us even more influence in their nation and improved relations with their trade board. Our steel, consumer goods and other modern appliances will be imported at high prices while we cheaply import their canned food."

Under a near monopoly of the AATC, little expansion was done in the last decades prompting the governement to step in and transfer construction rights to the Compañía Hispano–Argentina de Obras Públicas y Finanzas (CHADOPYF). They went on to create a new line for the system, the Line D connecting Catedral to Tribunales.\n\n Continued emigration to the city from the impouverished countryside and the massive influx of European immigrants has left our public transportation system severly lacking which has led to the government proposal to nationalise the network into the Transport Corporation of Buenos Aires (CTCBA) to allow for better expansion and to meet the demands created by the population explosion of the city."

Three years later the club published a call for tenders to built its new stadium. Economic hardship due to the Black Monday disaster and the inablility to find proper architects delayed the construction of the new stadion until 1938 when the club played their last match before the great work began.\n\n Finally opening on May 25, 1940, with a friendly match between Boca and San Lorenzo, the home side won 2-0 with both goals scored by Ricardo Alarcón.

argcar.1.t:0 "Status of Argentina"
argcar.1.d:0 "By the early 20th century, Argentina was enjoying a booming and fast growing economic prowess based on its meat and cereal exports. Immigrants from all over Europe flooded towards the Republic and vigorous entrepreneurship and a nascent industry quickly propelled Argentina forwards as one of the most prosperous nations on the planet. Trade relations were secure and exports to the United Kingdom and Germany kept increasing. \n\n When the Weltkrieg however struck, Argentina was forced into neutrality unwilling to side with either its most important economic ally, the UK, or its second most important one, Germany. By steering between the two, sanctions were brought down by the British, enforcing an embargo on trade with Germany. While Argentina tried circumventing this by selling through third countries, the sales were not the same and the pre-WK miracle slowed down. \n\n As the last years of the Weltkrieg approached, it became apparent to the UK that it was fighting a losing fight and ordered the Argentinian government and companies to ramp up production and exploit the nation to the fullest. Discontent with the increased demands and sick of British exploitation, the workers started to organise, protest and finally rise up in an armed revolt. Unable to fully contain the situation, the control of the Argentine government on the uprisings went from bad to worse and by the mid 20s Argentina had lost control of Santa Cruz, Chubut and Rio Negro Provinces to the newly formed Frente Obrero Patagonico. \n\n Three subsequent democratically elected governments were tasked with solving the crisis but failed one after another. In response to their incapacity to rule, General Uriburu rose up in 1930 to attempt crushing the revolt. A reign of terror spread across the nation with socialist and syndicalist sympathisers massacred and pushed southwards. His dictatorship is however short lived as he dies from cancer two years later, forming a power vacuum and once more no large scale intervention in the South."
argcar.1.a:0 "Very well"

argcar.100.d:0 "Elections are written out and through electoral fraud, the PAN under Roca successfully takes power, prompting a slow recovery from Uriburu's dictatorship and a changing attitude towards the FOP. Small skirmishes into FOP territory are launched and the navy successfully retakes the Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego. Intervention from Chile however stops the government from achieving victory and temporarily ends conflict with the FOP.  \n\n When in 1935 rumours start surfacing that Roca may be attempting to end the conflict and leave the FOP alone, outrage across the nation erupts, enabling the Liga Patriotica under Manuel Carles to gain the support they need culminating into the Christmas Coup. Supported by the Navy and various military elements, Carles coups the government on Christmas 1935, takes control over the Capital Region and starts solidifying his hold on the nation. \n\n As the first of January 1936 overtakes the nation, Carles is still in the midst of his attempted coup with success far from certain. Asides from the Buenos Aires capital region and small inland provinces, his control is nihil. Support from the ARA or 'Argentinian Armada' is guaranteed but many of the military commanders in the Army doubt Carles’ potential and are organising to put down his coup."

argcar.2.t:0 "Clashes at the Colegio Militar de la Nación"
argcar.2.d:0 "As one of the last strongholds in the greater Buenos Aires region, the Colegio Militar de la Nación was occupied by loyalist members of the military who had barricaded themselves inside the compound awaiting reinforcements from the interior. In response to this last ditch effort, soldiers of the ARA were sent in to try and push them out. While small clashes occured throughout the compound, the Army surrendered a week later when their basic utilities and will to hold out had started to fade. \n \n Amongst the captured were a few notable Army commanders but it seems that the majority of the Staff had fled the city during the first days of the Coup. This victory may be insignificant in the greater picture but we now firmly control the entirety of Buenos Aires."

According to the Argentine Constitution, the armed forces can technically not intervene in internal civil conflicts, so the Gendarmerie would be created as an organ subordinate to the Defense Ministry and thus the Carles cabinet. It would be defined as a civilian "security force of a military nature" and maintain a functional relationship with the Ministry of Defense, as part of both the National Defense System and the Interior Security System. It would therefore maintain capabilities arising from the demands required by joint military planning with the armed forces and and would legally be able to intervene in the current crisis.\n\n Our funds are however limited at this time and the loyalty of the new recruits would be questionable at best which has made Carles reconsider the proposal to avoid the possibility of a countercoup from within his own ranks."

The subsequent seperatism in Patagonia and the continued corruption and shady dealings of the conservative ruling party however have stumped our progress and kept the old system alive and triving. Not only has this led to great disgruntlement amongst the people, it has created a hotbed for Carles supporters who claim the High Court is obstructing "populist will". \n \n With Carles and his supporters now in control of the High Court, it has given him the perfect opportunity to strike the defunct system by relieving all 5 members of the Court from their duties and to replace them by his "men of the people". We can however further push our narrative and start replacing the lower courts as well with our followers although this might backfire greatly should the people turn sides."

The fall of momentum in our movement and the rising threat of an organised military opposition to Carles, has forced us to reconsider other options. The Grupo de Oficiales Unidos holds vast control over the Army and has not yet chosen whom to side with which could make them a valuable asset in our struggle.

The Panzers that were brought in from Buenos Aires to support the assailants proved to be ineffective in the small streets of the city and skirmishes in the Villa Diego and Saladillo quickly became disasters for the attackers. By the end of the 10-day struggle for the city, supplies and morale of the Carles forces ran out and the commanding officer formally surrendered to the GOU effectively ending the fight for Rosario and by extension the campaign to pacifiy the hinterlands."

With the majority of the loyalist soldiers on the borders planning the next offensive, little to no troops were left in the Buenos Aires region leading to a quick and decisive strike on governement facilities. Upon arriving at the Navy Petty-Officers School of Mechanics in the neighborhood of Núñez, the group was attacked by loyal forces who were entrenched there, resulting in the death of 30 and the wounding of 100 but ultimately the surrender of the ARA forces. \n\n Having surrendered the Navy School of Mechanics, the remaining Argentinian generals received the rebel leaders and declared Ramírez president of the Republic by noon.

Gendarmería had been sent in to quell the strikers and force them back to work but clashes between government forces and protestors quickly escalated, leading to hard oppression by the police forces and the arrestation of dozens of strikers. \n\n Personal intervention however by Perón has made the Unions and management come to a fragile agreement followed by the release of Peter to calm the masses down.

argcar.36.d:0 "Even though the Unions have been legalised now by Ramírez, a clausule was included which lets the government take over any union at will. The powerful railroad union, which formed the foundation of the CGT was the first to fall under this new policy and has been placed under direct government control. A so called "inventor" has been placed in the organisation as supervisor but is more a direct extension of the government than an independent agent.\n\n Strikes against this move almost immediately followed but were put down hard by the gendarmaria whom have arrested dozens more influential socialist leaders. The Unions however have started to change direction sensing that the new government is heavily anti-unions and therefore a group under Ángel Borlenghi has approached Colonel Domingo Mercante to sit down and come to a peaceful resolution."

argcar.37.t:0 "Mercante and the Unions reach an accord"
argcar.37.d:0 "Represented by Ángel Borlenghi, Francisco Pablo Capozzi and Juan Atilio Bramuglia, the Unions opted, albeit with reservations and distrust, to establish relations with a sector of the military government more inclined to accept union demands, with the aim of forming an alliance capable of influencing the course of events. To achieve initial contact with the military they chose Colonel Domingo Mercante, the son of an important railroad union leader and member of the GOU, to represent the government and hopefully persuade him to listen to the Unions. In turn, Mercante summoned his political partner and close friend, Juan Perón, a colonel and member of the GOU. \n\n While the negotiations were tough, the proposal of the Unions that the military created a Secretariat of Labor, strengthen a now loyal CGT, and sanction a series of labor laws that would accept the historical claims of the Argentine labor movement was positively recieved by the colonels. They however demanded the immediate release of Peter, who was imprisoned earlier this year when the army rolled up the FOIC."

argcar.38.d:0 "After his sucess to broker a deal between the unions and the military government, Perón was granted the office of Head of the Department of Labor. A completely empty position with no power, we hoped this would keep the ambitious colonel busy and blocked from further rise in politics. He however succesfully fullfilled the office and even gave it a new meaning by approving the labour laws that had been claimed historically by the Argentine labor movement (extending the severance indemnity that existed since 1934 for commerce employees, pensions for commerce employees, a multi-clinic hospital for railway workers, technical schools for workers, the prohibition of employment agencies, the creation of the labor courts, Christmas bonuses), lending efficacy to the existing labor inspectors and impelling for the first time collective bargaining, which grew to become the basic way of regulating the relationship between capital and labor. Moreover he forced us to drop the decree regarding unions associations sanctioned by president Ramírez in the first weeks of the revolution, which was criticized by the entire labor movement. \n\nIn addition, Perón, Mercante, and the initial group of unionists who formed the alliance began to organize a new union that would assume a nationalist-labor identity. The group assumed an anti-syndicalist position already existing in parts of the old CGT and, relying on the power of the Secretary of Labor, organized new unions in the industries which lacked them (chemicals, electricity, tobacco) and set up rival unions in industries with powerful old and hostile to the governement, unions (meat, construction, textiles, metallurgy)."

Ramírez, unwilling to back down now and risk the anger of German diplomats has not yet taken a decision but must do so quickly if he wishes to remain in power.

An unfamiliar social class, which had remained completely absent from Argentine history until then, burst into Buenos Aires and demanded Perón's freedom. The city was taken by tens of thousands of workers from the industrial areas that had been growing on the outskirts of the city. The crowd set itself up in the Plaza de Mayo and refused to leave until their demands were met. It was characterized by the large number of young people and especially women who were part of it, and by the predominance of people with hair and skin darker than those who attended the traditional political acts of the time. The anti-Peronist opposition stressed these difference, referring to them in derogatory terms such as “blacks”, “fat people”, “ descamisados (shirtless)”, “cabecitas negras”. It was the Radical Unionist leader Sammartino who even went so far as to call the event a “zoo flood”.\n\n The protestors were accompanied by a whole new generation of young people and new union delegates belonging to the unions of the CGT, which had responded to a sugar workers’ strike two days earlier. It was a completely peaceful demonstration, but the political and cultural upheaval was of such heft that, in a few hours, the triumph of the anti-Peronist movement had been cancelled out, as did the remaining power of the military government. \n\n After intense negotiations the radical Armando Antille distinguished himself as Perón's delegate leading to his liberation.
