LIT_anti_slavic_laws_desc:0 "The Byelorussian and Polish minorities in the Vilnius region have been a thorn in our goals, but we hold the power of law making.

LIT_september_8:0 "Declare September 8 as National Day"
LIT_september_8_desc:0 "September 8, the day when Vytautas the Great was supposed to be coronated King, if not for his untimely death. He was the saviour of Lithuania from Polish dominance, and in these days of German rule, we must look at his persona as an icon of our struggle."

### Leader descriptions ###

POLITICS_VOLDEMARAS_DESC:0 "Kazys Škirpa's life is quite colorful to an outsider. He was one of the first volunteers in the Lithuanian army in 1918, and soon worked his way to Major General, but he was quick to realize that there will be no free and independent Lithuania under the German thumb. Škirpa and a number of minor disgruntled officers formed the Iron Wolf Organization, a National Populist paramilitary fighting against German rule and the Slavic minorities within the Kingdom, as well as the Party of Lithuanian Interests as the movement's political arm. And now, he is in charge, under the Lithuanian equivalent title of the Romanian Conducator or Russian Vozhd - Tautos Vadas."
POLITICS_MINDAUGAS_III_DESC:0 "Born as Karl Gero von Urach, the son of Wilhelm Karl, Duke of Urach, Mindaugas III ascended to the throne of Lithuania after his father's death in 1929, and has ruled this Baltic nation since. Even though he bears the name of the first king of Lithuania, it's unifier and folk hero, Mindaugas III is not concerned with the people he reigns over at all - they are foreigners to him. And Karl Gero is as much of a foreigner to them. It's hard to say if Mindaugas III would survive even a day on the throne without the Kaiser backing him from the shadows."
POLITICS_KAZIMIERAS_II_DESC:0 "A Polish-Lithuanian aristocrat from Kretinga, Kazimieras Viktoras Tiškevičius, now Kazimieras II, has committed the greatest sin possible in the eyes of the common Lithuanian - selling out to the Russians and giving up his nation's sovereignity to return the country under the hated eastern tyrant. This event has tainted his image to his people forever, and even though Tiškevičius is a capable administrator, a bright mind and even feels some compassion for the people he rules, his rule over Lithuania is tenuous at best."

### Events ###
lithuania.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Lithuania in 1936"
lithuania.1.d:0 "O Lithuania, land of the brave, where oaks grow strong and the people are hardy. What an ironic twist of fate it is that you were saved and 'freed' by the progeny of the same Teutons that pillaged and ravaged your land. You are once more a Kingdom, 700 years after the death of King Mindaugas I, and yet you are a mere puppet state in the middle of Mitteleuropa. While you are not as German-dominated as the United Baltic Duchy in the North, your position is still unbearable."
lithuania.1.a:0 "Interesting, tell me more!"
lithuania.1.b:0 "Yada, yada, just let me play!"

lithuania.2.t:0 "The Kingdom's State of Politics"
lithuania.2.d:0 "Ever since the establishment of the Kingdom in 1918, and especially after Syndicalist revolutions in the West, Lithuania has been dominated strictly by conservative politics. The clerical, pro-German and anti-Syndicalist Lithuanian Christian Democrats have worked hard to modernise your economy, but their reign might just come to an end, challenged by the nationalist and anti-German 'Party of Lithuanian Interests' led by Kazys Škirpa, as well as the resurgent Social Democrats under Vladas Požela."
lithuania.2.a:0 "Really?"

lithuania.3.t:0 "The Kingdom's Overall Situation"
lithuania.3.d:0 "Lithuania is arguably the weakest member of Mitteleuropa, but it is critical to the effort of the Germans. It holds a strategic position between East Prussia and Germany's East Slavic puppets and it's the Kaiserreich's only meaningful way of access to the United Baltic Duchy. As such, the Kaiser will be more than willing to reign Lithuania in if it tries to rebel. Russia has a lot of interest in Lithuania, too, and the Belarusian minorities in the Vilnius region have led to friction between the Kingdom and the White Ruthenians. And what of the incoming clash with the International?.."
lithuania.3.a:0 "I'd rather play as Poland."

lithuania.4.t:0 "Adolfas Šapoka writes 'Lietuvos Istorija'"
lithuania.4.d:0 "A young Lithuanian historian, Adolfas Šapoka, has written and published a 600 page tome on the history of Lithuania from it's creation to present day. Seen as highly patriotic and pro-Lithuanian, it is definitely aligned with the views of the Lithuanian nationalists, and yet has been critically acclaimed and distributed across the country, with over 100 000 copies released by the end of the year."
lithuania.4.a:0 "A fine read. But also quite troubling."

lithuania.5.t:0 "Black Monday hits Lithuania!"
lithuania.5.d:0 "The rampaging economic downturn that started with the Berlin Stock Exchange has not left us out of the chaos. Now that hundreds of industries in Germany are closing and others kicking out unneeded workers, the demand for Lithuanian agricultural and industrial produces dropped like a rock. Fields are left deserted, unemployed workers line up for soup kitchens by the hundreds and the gross domestic product has plummeted. \n What can the poor Lithuanians do against this travesty?"
lithuania.5.a:0 "Who's going to buy our butter and geese now?"

lithuania.6.t:0 "Response to Black Monday"
lithuania.6.d:0 "An emergency session of the Seimas has gathered today to discuss the matters of the Lithuanian economy, which are getting worse by the minute. More and more factories are closing. Farmers, unable to sell their produces, sell their cows and spill their milk on the sidewalks. The unemployed gather in soup kitchens to survive. The Seimas is split between two major factions, both of which have their own ideas on how to solve the situation and get out of the Depression that has been caused by the Black Monday."
lithuania.6.a:0 "V.V. Carneckis - the state should build up profitable industries and industrialise"
lithuania.6.b:0 "J. Pleckaitis - the system must be reorganised to help the common man"

lithuania.7.t:0 "The economy has recovered"
lithuania.7.d:0 "After a long time of recovery and fighting the plague that was the economic crash of the Black Monday, the economy of Lithuania has seemingly started to recover. Unemployment is dropping and the value of the Lithuanian mark is finally coming back to pre-1936 levels. In slightly more morbid news, the suicide rate, previously leading in the entirety of Europe, is finally lower..."
lithuania.7.a:0 "Good. I'll go loosen the noose, then."

lithuania.8.t:0 "The Third Front"
lithuania.8.d:0 "While syndicalist wretches are thriving in the French commune and the rest of the Internationale, Lithuania used to be solidly defended by these ideas. That has been proven false by the discovery of an underground newspaper called 'The Third Front' (Trecias frontas). While it presents itself as a collection of modernist avant-garde literature that can't be published in traditional media, it is also heavily far-left and agitates for ushering in a new and better Syndicalist government in the nation. How should we respond?"
lithuania.8.a:0 "They are no threat, syndicalism cannot thrive here"
lithuania.8.b:0 "Disperse their circles!"

lithuania.9.t:0 "Nationalist Rally"
lithuania.9.d:0 "The streets are filled with patriotic members of the Speak Lithuanian movement today, with over a few thousand activists marching across the city and demanding to rid the country of German influence. \n After visiting the local cemetery to pay respects to the heroes that fought in the Weltkrieg to create the nation as we know it, then returned to the cities, where minor violence began. A few civilians, most of German origin, were injured, a few store windows were left broken and shattered, but eventually the crowds dispersed. \n A few of the most radical participants were arrested, but they are small fries compared to the men organising this mess..."
lithuania.9.a:0 "Horrible!"

lithuania.10.t:0 "Blue Cockades Organize Rally"
lithuania.10.d:0 "The streets are filled with left-leaning students, workers and sympathisers today, as the Lithuanian syndicalist movement, the Blue Cockades - taking the symbols from the cockades Lithuanian revolutionaries used to wear during the Kosciuzko Uprising in 1794. They call for the eviction of German and capitalist influence in the country and the creation of a Lithuanian syndicalist state. \n\nPolice reports prequent clashes between the blue-clad dissenters and the numerous Lithuanian nationalist gangs, the Iron Wolves. Nobody was killed, but many were sent to hospitals or arrested. However, none of the leaders were found, despite known ties to the Lithuanian Work Federation and the underground Democratic Syndicate of Lithuania."
lithuania.10.a:0 "Horrible!"

lithuania.11.t:0 "Election of 1938"
lithuania.11.d:0 "The early rays of the spring sun have begun to melt down the snow across the country, but the politics of the nation are as unstable as ever. Parades of Nationalist militias and dissenters flood the streets hoping for a victory at the election, and the voter turnout has been the highest since the nation's inception. The Christian-Democrats received blows to their popularity from the events of Black Monday, but nevertheless remain strong, while the Social-Democrats are attempting to rally the working class into voting for them. How will the people decide?"
lithuania.11.a:0 "The Christian Democrats remain in power"
lithuania.11.b:0 "Social-Democrats secure a majority"
lithuania.11.c:0 "A coalition of Nationalist parties led by Voldemaras obtain victory"

lithuania.12.t:0 "Change in Political Situation"
lithuania.12.d:0 "Now that the Constitution of 1920 has been revised and updated, making our country more democratic, the stances of the ruling party have changed, too. We can no longer call ourselves authoritarian, we are not a Prussian Constitutional monarchy anymore. We are a full democracy, just with a figurehead king."
lithuania.12.a:0 "Good"

lithuania.13.t:0 "The End of the Kingdom"
lithuania.13.d:0 "As the declaration of the abolition of the position of King of Lithuania and the arrest of Karl Gero von Urach, former Mindaugas III, finalised, the entirety of Lithuania was now transformed into a much different state. The last bits of democracy have been swept away, the Seimas has been dissolved, and the Party of Lithuanian National Interests now reigns supreme. Augustinas Voldemaras has declared himself to be the Leader - Vadas - and put his Iron Wolf brigades to work. \n\nThe creation of the Lithuanian National Republic can now only be stopped by Germany, whose interests in Lithuania have now been sorely broken..."
lithuania.13.a:0 "Lietuva lietuviams!"

lithuania.14.t:0 "Lithuania declares independence!"
lithuania.14.d:0 "The dastardly Lithuanians have betrayed us! After the election of 1938, which was won by the national populist Party of Lithuanian National Interests, more commonly known as 'Speak Lithuanian', the puppet Kingdom was rapidly transformed into a radical nationalist republic, with Kazys Škirpa as the 'Vadas' - Leader. \n\nThe Lithuanians have already seized numerous Lithuanian companies and arrested important German representatives in their nation, even their former King Karl Gero von Urach, and declare that they will listen to no one. How should we respond?"
lithuania.14.a:0 "We will crush them in the blink of an eye!"
lithuania.14.b:0 "We have more important matters, leave them be. For now"

lithuania.15.t:0 "A second in command for the Vadas?"
lithuania.15.d:0 "Now that we are fully in control of the Lithuanian nation, we have to shape the government of the new National Republic into the most preferrable for our patriotic goals. The Vadas, Kazys Škirpa, already has a bunch of possible candidates from the party, and he needs a second in command, the person who will keep ties between him and the cabinet of ministers. Which option should we pick?"
lithuania.15.a:0 "Vladas Mironas, a Catholic priest, liked by the people."
lithuania.15.b:0 "Petras Kubiliūnas, the head of the Iron Guard paramilitaries."
lithuania.15.c:0 "Juozas Eretas, Škirpa's most loyal follower, will stay as the second in command."

lithuania.16.t:0 "Peace with Lithuania?"
lithuania.16.d:0 "It has become apparent that the Lithuanians will not be an easy nut to crack. Even though the countries of Mitteleuropa surround them from all sides, their forces have been able to push back our advances and even captured Konigsberg, the capital of East Prussia. Perhaps we should let the Lithuanians go and keep our focus on other fronts instead."
lithuania.16.a:0 "Offer them Memel in exchange for peace."
lithuania.16.b:0 "It's just a temporary setback!"

lithuania.17.t:0 "Germany offers peace"
lithuania.17.d:0 "Our armed forces are victorious! The Germans, seeing that they will not be able to defeat us that easily, now offer peace! They even give us the chance to keep Klaipėda, the heart of Lithuania Minor, in the National Republic. Should we accept this peace proposal or keep pushing forward?"
lithuania.17.a:0 "It's a deal."
lithuania.17.b:0 "No, let's press for more!"

lithuania.18.t:0 "The Lithuanians have accepted"
lithuania.18.d:0 "The Lithuanians have agreed to our proposal. A peace treaty has been signed between the two nations in captured Memel, and Memelland has now been returned to the Lithuanian side. Mitteleuropa walks away in shame, and now Germany no longer has a land route to it's eastern puppets..."
lithuania.18.a:0 "As soon as the armistice ends, we'll take it back"

lithuania.19.t:0 "The Lithuanians have declined"
lithuania.19.d:0 "Peace negotiations have broken down! The Lithuanians perhaps got too confident, and now believe that they can push even beyond Konigsberg! While they are of course foolish to believe that they can take down the Kaiserreich itself, the fact that we now have one more long-term front to deal with is not good for our situation..."
lithuania.19.a:0 "Time for a third Tanenberg, then."

lithuania.20.t:0 "Peace with Lithuania?"
lithuania.20.d:0 "It has become apparent that the Lithuanians will not be an easy nut to crack. Even though the countries of Mitteleuropa surround them from all sides, their forces have been able to push back our advances and even captured a large portion of our territory. Perhaps we should swallow the defeat and concede the lands they have taken."
lithuania.20.a:0 "Offer Novogrudok in exchange for peace."
lithuania.20.b:0 "It's just a temporary setback!"

lithuania.21.t:0 "White Ruthenia offers peace"
lithuania.21.d:0 "Our armed forces are victorious! The White Russians, seeing that they are losing against our might, now offer peace! They even give us the chance to keep Naugardukas, one of Lithuania's core territories hundreds of years ago. Should we accept this peace proposal or keep pushing forward?"
lithuania.21.a:0 "It's a deal."
lithuania.21.b:0 "We'll reunite the Grand Duchy! All of it!"

lithuania.22.t:0 "The Lithuanians have accepted"
lithuania.22.d:0 "Peace negotiations have been finalised in Minsk, and our diplomats walk away in shame. White Ruthenia has been defeated, and Lithuania has annexed the territory of Novogrudok. The lands of the White Rus' shrink even more, and the strength of our nation is being sapped away, bit by bit. But at least peace has returned to our lands."
lithuania.22.a:0 "At least we still have Minsk..."

lithuania.23.t:0 "The Lithuanians have declined!"
lithuania.23.d:0 "The Lithuanians have gotten confident and believe that Novogrudok is not enough! In their point of view, the armies of the National Republic can conquer the entire White Ruthenia, despite their small size!"
lithuania.23.a:0 "We will never surrender!"

lithuania.24.t:0 "Lithuania offers Baltic unification"
lithuania.24.d:0 "The recently elected Lithuanian government has stayed fiercely loyal to Mitteleuropa, and now, they propose a deal we never even considered before - the unification of all three Baltic nations under the United Baltic banner. \n\nTo the Lithuanians, the Latvians and Estonians are their brothers, and even though we Germans still rule over them, they see a united Baltic state as superior to, say, Russian tyranny. How should we respond?"
lithuania.24.a:0 "Ask the Kaiser to allow us to unify."
lithuania.24.b:0 "The Lithuanians are not our concern"

lithuania.25.t:0 "The Baltic Duchy has declined"
lithuania.25.d:0 "The German government of the Baltic Duchy has declined our generous offer of Baltic unification. According to them, we'd just be a problem and a chore for their administrative aparatus, so they have decided to distance themselves from us."
lithuania.25.a:0 "Disappointing."

lithuania.26.t:0 "The Balts want to unite"
lithuania.26.d:0 "Envoys from the United Baltic Duchy and Lithuania have arrived to Berlin today. They ask the Kaiser to give his opinion on their offer of the unification of the two states into a single entity. Apparently, it was Lithuania who initiated the talks - they sure are loyal to our cause! But perhaps empowering the United Baltic Duchy will be problematic in the long term?"
lithuania.26.a:0 "Give Adolf Friedrich the green light"
lithuania.26.b:0 "No, we must not make the UBD too strong"

lithuania.27.t:0 "Germany has accepted!"
lithuania.27.d:0 "Cheers! The Kaiser has given us the green light for the annexation of Lithuania, and now, the process of unification can proceed! Thousands of people have took it to the streets to cheer for the newly created nation of all Balts!"
lithuania.27.a:0 "A new page in our history!"

lithuania.28.t:0 "Germany has declined"
lithuania.28.d:0 "Even though both the United Baltic Duchy and Lithuania were in favour of the proposal to unite the two states into one, the Kaiser has said his final word on the matter - and it was no. There will be no Baltic unification. At least not within our lifetimes."
lithuania.28.a:0 "Sad!"

lithuania.29.t:0 "A Dark Omen"
lithuania.29.d:0 "Vyacheslav Vladimirovich was a simple man. Even though his family comes from Russian colonists who arrived here in the late 19th century, he considers himself to be a Lithuanian, even if he speaks Russian and pledges loyalty to Russia. But times have changed. Our new government is openly against Slavs, be it Russians, Poles and Belarusians, and the Iron Wolf brigades have already attacked his peaceful home on the outskirts of Vilnius. Despite loving his homeland, Vyacheslav was forced to emigrate, leave the nation and settle in Dvinsk. Yet another fleeing soul. \n\nWhile some people like Vyacheslav protested the new government with their feet, others are taking a far more active stance. Russian, Polish and Belorussian minorities are openly protesting the Vadas's government, urging for action against discrimination. They might be organizing into a movement, despite our fierce opposition to that..."
lithuania.29.a:0 "Lithuania is for Lithuanians!"

lithuania.30.t:0 "The Alliance for Liberation"
lithuania.30.d:0 "Representatives from Russian, Polish and Belorussian minorities, as well as many Lithuanian opposition politicians, have organised an underground assembly of the so-called 'Alliance for Liberation', a movement directed against our rule, calling for a fair treatment of the Slavic minorities. The STT has enough proof, however, that this is merely a lie, and the organisation is planning an armed pro-Russian rebellion against the state. The Alliance is unorganised and lacks a leader, but that might change soon."
lithuania.30.a:0 "We'll keep an eye on this treachery."

lithuania.31.t:0 "The Silver Knight"
lithuania.31.d:0 "Kazimieras Viktoras Tiškevičius, a Polish-Lithuanian noble from Kretinga, has risen to become the new leader of the pro-Slavic Alliance for Liberation. A descendant of the original House of Gediminas that ruled the Grand Duchy in medieval times, Tiškevičius is opposed to the Republic that we have founded and wishes to see a restoration of a monarchy - with him as the monarch, of course. The noble has turned the organization into a vehicle for his underground campaign, and he has even gone so far as to begin requesting help from the Russians. He is aware that he cannot win on his own..."
lithuania.31.a:0 "He's just a lost romantic. It'll blow away."
lithuania.31.b:0 "This has gone too far! Arrest the traitor immediately!"

lithuania.32.t:0 "The Silver Knight"
lithuania.32.d:0 "An interesting person has arrived to the Duma today. Kazimieras Viktoras Tiškevičius, a Polish-Lithuanian noble from Kretinga and the leader of the pro-Russian 'Alliance for Liberation' in Lithuania, he has arrived to request our help in his campaign. Tiškevičius believes that the only path for his party is to execute a coup and cut off the hydra that is the Lithuanian national-populists, and he even swears that he will align the restored monarchy to our interests should he be successful. But many do not believe his story. How should we respond?"
lithuania.32.a:0 "Boy, we'll give you all we need, do the dirty work for us!"
lithuania.32.b:0 "We're fine with Voldemaras in Lithuania, thanks."

lithuania.33.t:0 "Russophile Coup!"
lithuania.33.d:0 "Kazimieras Viktoras Tiškevičius has raised the Alliance for Liberation for a march to Vilnius! His masses are bolstered by what seems to be supporting Russian soldiers - the bastard went to Russia and acquired their support in this endeavor! Traitor! Or maybe our next leader... \n\nThe Alliance for Liberation seeks to restore the Grand Duchy of Lithuania of old, and they are opposed by regular military units in the capital as well as Iron Wolf brigades. This is a battle for the history books..."
lithuania.33.a:0 "Long live the new Grand Duke!"
lithuania.33.b:0 "Iron Wolf militias defend the capital!"

lithuania.34.t:0 "Coup in Lithuania successful!"
lithuania.34.d:0 "The Alliance for Liberation was successful! Kazimieras II Tiškevičius now reigns as the new monarch of Lithuania. And as expected, he is ready to pay lip service to us. A new puppet state has joined the Russian sphere of influence."
lithuania.34.a:0 "Ura!"
