pers.1.d:0 "지난 수십 년간, [PER.GetNameDef]는 끊임없는 변화와 불안정한 상태에 있었습니다. Having gained full independence from Russia and the British Empire, we have struggled to find our own place in this world. All around [PER.GetNameDef], from the smallest hamlet in the furthest corners of the nation to the big cities like [266.GetName], we can see the difference in beliefs between the people. Just a few years ago, the Shah himself was shot by a socialist assassin. Although he survived, the Shah's health has been declining by the day. It is clear the nation cannot survive like it is, and with the Shah's death looming, there are fears ideological divide could turn into open revolt. Democrats trying to force a republic, royalists who would support a powerful monarchy lead by the Shah's brother, Hassan Mirza, and socialists, attempting to create the first socialist state in the Middle East. We can only hope the power transition is peaceful...\n\nOur nation's military is in shambles, and we are still recovering from a famine that killed millions of our people. Not only that, our political class is dominated by a corrupt aristocracy, ruining our political legitimacy. Our nation has many problems to sort out, but if we can do it successfully, we could become the greatest Empire the Middle East has ever seen."

Just a few days ago with the death of Ahmad Shah Qajar, the revolutionaries present in the city, much like 1908's constitutional revolution, began to take control of the city. In a fast swoop of the important locations, including Constitution house of Tabriz, Tabriz Grand Bazaar and Kabud mosque, they manage to almost capture the entirety of the city. While those loyal to Hassan Mirza were surprised by the Tabrizi Revolutionaries, they managed to secure the Arg-e Alishah Mausoleum as it proved a good location to holdout against revolutionary forces, as was proven by Russians who took control of Tabriz in 1911."

While the revolutionary forces have managed to take control of most of the city the Qashqai tribesmen, loyal to the Shah, are moving in to capture Shiraz and might bring the city to loyalist control. Unbeknownst to the Qashqai tribe, the Revolutionary Bakhtiari tribe, who have always been in favor of the constitutionalists and participated in the 1907 constitutional revolution dispatched a huge force to help out the revolutionaries.

The port city of Bandar e'Abbas for the past few days has witnessed heavy fighting between the supporters of Hassan Mirza and Revolutionaries. Although the city was initially well guarded by Qajar supporters, due to its importance, Edalat party members had been secretly importing foreign socialists into the city in order to fight the Qajar soldiers when the time was right. As soon as the news of Ahmad Shah's death spread, Qajar forces began to fortify important parts of the city, especially the port, putting it on lockdown until further notice. Meanwhile, the revolutionaries alongside the foreign fighters began to strike the weaker Qajar positions when they least expected it. In a few hours the smaller Qajar outposts had been wiped out entirely, and when the news reached the Qajar forces it was too late for them do anything, but to fortify the last few major posts they held. Due to infrastructure problems, no reinforcements will get to the city in time."

With the economic reforms underway we need a huge source of income and we believe Sheikh Khaz'al's wealth is the answer. If we can convince him to supply us with his wealth willingly we can prevent any unwanted hostilities.

These parties have come together to try to reduce the influence of the Edalat and Democrat party, and disagree with them on almost every field.

Second is a coalition between the Tajadod party and the Eetedaliun party under Mohammad Mosaddegh. Although they disagree somewhat on social policies, economically they can work together effectively. Both are not major parties, so they need eachothers combined popularity to win. Finally is the the Eslah Talaban party.

The longest and darkest night of the year which is the winter solstice in the northern hemisphere is the night where Iranic people gather together and their families to eat, drink and read poetry. Dating back to the beginnings of the Zoroastrian faith, Yalda is almost as important as Nowruz to all Iranic people."

pers.101.d:0 "Recently, a bear cub was found by one of our officers in [266.GetName]'s nearby fortifications. While initially we had planned to take away the bear due to military regulations, we have begun to reconsider, as troops stationed in the fort have petitioned for it to stay. We have decided to allow the bear to stay at the fort for the time being to increase moral. The troops have decided to name him Rostam."

pers.102.t:0 "Rostam the bear"
pers.102.d:0 "Rostam the bear has been growing up alongside our army pretty well. Due to his owner being transferred to the 2nd Artillery supply company, Rostam was transferred to the company and has ever since been befriending its troops. They have taken the bear as their own mascot and it even helps them with carrying their artillery."
pers.102.a:0 "Truly a bizarre occurrence in the history of the [PER.GetAdjective] army."

pers.103.t:0 "Problems with Rostam"
pers.103.d:0 "Sadly, due to financial problems, the owner of Rostam is looking to sell him to the highest bidder. This will no doubt cause a loss of moral for the 2nd Artillery supply company. Several high ranking generals have began discussing the situation and we must decide what to do."
pers.103.a:0 "We have more important matters than a silly bear!"
pers.103.b:0 "We must purchase Rostam!"

pers.104.t:0 "Rostam has been sold"
pers.104.d:0 "Rostam the bear was sold to a Polish merchant passing through [PER.GetNameDef]. It seems the Polish merchant caravan was deeply amused by the military bear and as soon as they found out he was up for sale they purchased him. They have even began to call him a new name, Wojtek."
pers.104.a:0 "Alas, Wojtek's fate shall take him to Poland."

PER_core_afghan_land:0 "헤라트 통합"
PER_core_afghan_land_desc:0 "Now that we have gained control of our lands in Afghanistan again, we can begin to integrate it into [PER.GetNameDef]. However, it is going to take decades to fully intergrate the eastern area due to their Pashtun ethnic majority. In the west of Afghanistan, the population is majority Hazara, a group we can more easily integrate into our nation. The Pashtuns most likely will resist our attempts, but eventually they will accept our leadership."
PER_core_azerbaijani_land:0 "아제르바이잔 통합"
PER_core_azerbaijani_land_desc:0 "Azerbaijan is now under our direct rule again. After some time, most Azerbaijanis will give up on their dream of their own state, and will accept our leadership. Although there will be some resistance to our rule, we have a very large Azerbaijani minority, and the nation of Azerbaijan only existed for a few decades. Therefore, Azerbaijani resistance will be weak and futile."
PER_core_baluchistan:0 "발루치스탄 통합"
PER_core_baluchistan_desc:0 "The state of Baluchistan has been returned to our control. The Baluchi people are a large ethnic group in our nation, so we should be able to integrate the Baluchi population fully into our state. However, they will resist our rule, due to the fact that they have been under Indian control for much time."
