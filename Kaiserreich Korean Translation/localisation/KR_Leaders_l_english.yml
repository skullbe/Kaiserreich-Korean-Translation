unit_leader.1.d:0 "In [From.GetHerHis] service to [From.From.GetNameDef], it seems [From.GetRank] [From.GetName] has pushed [From.GetHerselfHimself] too far. As a result of the bad climate in their operational area, the [From.GetRank] has now fallen ill, and will likely need some time to recover. Until [From.GetSheHe] gets well, [From.GetSheHe] will not be performing at [From.GetHerHis] usual level."

unit_leader.2.d:0 "In bringing the battle to a successful conclusion, it seems [From.GetRank] [From.GetName] put [From.GetHerselfHimself] at a bit too much risk while leading [From.GetHerHis] men. [From.GetSheHeCap] has been wounded, and it will likely take some time for the wounds to fully heal, until which time the [From.GetRank] will not be performing at [From.GetHerHis] usual level."

### Leader Descriptions ###
POLITICS_SAUDI_DESC:0 "Abdulaziz Ibn Saud, the mortal rival of many dead men, now turns his sights towards Saud bin Abdulaziz. This rivalry began when the young Ibn Saud was ejected from his tent in Riyadh by the Rashids. Never a pawn of Emirs, ibn Saud's father rallied the destitute men of the coastal Emirates to the great goal of his dynasty, Wahhabism. The Rashids were then ejected at the cost of many men, including their only western ally. Ibn Saud himself started many a feuds the Saudis inherited, as he expressed hatred towards any Arab who turned their nose up towards Bedouins. Ibn Saud overcame this anger, and leveraged his past to negotiate the protection of the western Emirates after Britian left. However, this seed of anger had passed onto his men, who inherited his ferocity and may turn this youthful fury against him yet."

POLITICS_PHILIPPE_PETAIN_DESC:0 "베르덩의 사자는 북아프리카에서 지중해 건너 편의 사악한 생디칼리스트 쥐새끼들에게 거칠게 포효하는 것으로만 보이지만, 그는 조국 프랑스와 그가 가진 모든 것들이 무너지는 광경을 바라보며 가슴이 찢어질 듯한 슬픔에 울부짖었습니다. 그는 자신의 군대가 반란을 일으킬 것이라고는 꿈에도 몰랐고, 에펠 탑에 붉은 깃발이 게양되는 것도 전혀 예상치 못했으며, 자신이 낡은 증기선을 타고 프랑스에서 알제로 탈출하리라는 것도 예상치 못했습니다. 국민 프랑스는 옛 프랑스 공화국의 영광의 그림자에도 미치지 못하지만, 페텡 원수와 그의 조국에 사는 모든 이들의 가슴 속에는 여전히 무언가가 요동치고 있었고, 그것은 그들의 가라앉을 줄 모르는 복수심이었습니다. 베르덩의 사자는 자신의 몸이 북아프리카의 모래가 아닌 프랑스의 땅, 베르덩에 묻히는 것 외에는 바라는 것이 없습니다. 베르덩의 사자는 다시 뛰어들 것입니다. 이번에는 붉은 반역자들을 끝장내기 위해서!"
POLITICS_JEAN_III_DESC:0 "Jean III de Orléans, once the picture of aristocratic aloofness, was severely affected by the syndicalist revolution in France. As he fled to North Africa, he became convinced of the necessity of the monarchy in securing the future of the embattled France and its people. Working closely with Action Française, Jean presented himself as the champion of the people in the fight against syndicalism. With the restoration of the Orléans monarchy, Jean aims to destroy the Communards, and extend the monarchy's principled governance to all France."
POLITICS_NAPOLEON_IV_DESC:0 "Louis Napoleon IV de Bonaparte is the symbol of a France renewed. Coronated in the Notre Dame d'Afrique with the same grandiosity as the first Napoleon in Paris, he represents the ambition of the restoration of France's old glory. Like his ancestor at Austerlitz, Louis Napoleon endeavours to strike a deadly blow to the heart of France's enemies."
POLITICS_PIERRE_FLANDIN_DESC:0 "Pierre Etienne Flandin reminisces of the France that was before the turmoil of the Weltkrieg and revolution. A devotee of laissez faire economics and quite socially conservative, but also firmly republican, Flandin's vision of France's future is equally a vision of the past he so cherishes."
POLITICS_ANDRE_MALLARME_DESC:0 "André Mallarmé is often smeared by his political opponents as foolishly idealistic. Mallarmé embraces such criticisms; indeed, he is an idealist, but to be an idealist, Mallarmé argues, is to subscribe to the most worthy of notions: liberty, equality, and fraternity, the rallying cry of France's first republicans. Mallarmé believes that though syndicalism is an affront to human dignity, the concerns of France's people must be not only tolerated, but considered. A liberal republic, to Mallarmé, is the only effective defence against syndicalism."
POLITICS_FERNAND_BOUISSON_DESC:0 "Fernand Bouisson, a deputy from the 'Bouches du Rhone' before the Weltkrieg and a Pied-Noir, was well suited for the political atmosphere of the exiled French Republic. Bouisson, a leftist with a disdain for syndicalism did not hesitate to publicly disavow that ideology in an address before the chamber of deputies. Bouisson is guided compassion for his fellow man, and the belief that all French should have their needs met."
POLITICS_CHARLES_DEGAULLE_DESC:0 "Charles de Gaulle, who once fought furiously against both the Germans and Communards, now, as president, battles for the fate of the French Republic. A protégé of Philippe Petain, de Gaulle advocates a strong executive as the only institution capable of guiding the wayward Republic back to prominence. As a leader of men, both in the field of battle and in the halls of the legislature, de Gaulle has proven capable."
POLITICS_HENRI_VI_DESC:0 "Henri VI de Orléans, though but a boy when France was swept up in the fires of revolution, still bears a scar on his forearm where a stray piece of shrapnel embedded itself all those years ago. The trials Henri experienced in his youth steeled his resolve to dedicate himself to France; though paternalistic, Henri is deeply personally invested in his people's wellbeing. As king, Henri seeks to be both France's sword and its shield in the struggle for its future."

POLITICS_SAID_TAIMUR_DESC:0 "The Al Said dynasty, which had reaped the benefits of British support in the 19th century, stil yet lives. Folllowing the Peace with Honor in 1921, the young Said bin Taimur accelerated through his political education in Muscat. The former Sultan Taimur bin Feisal had prepared a wise council for his son in 1935 when he abdicated the throne. Said bin Taimur was left with a sense of superiority over the Shia in the Truncial coast and the Ibadi tribesman in Oman proper. More concerning was the new Sultan's attitude towards Dhofaris. Said bin Taimur has taxed them mercilessly, and remained silent to the slave trade that opresses Dhofar."

POLITICS_RAGHIB_DESC:0 "The rival of the Husayni family for decades, Raghib was a student of Istanbul University until the end of the Weltkrieg. Upon returning to Jerusalem, he saw that the Husayni family's aim for an independant Palestine was based on a conflicting promises and antisemitism. Although he himself was Muslim, he believed that the prevailing Palestinian nationalism would be hijacked by a foreign power. Thus, Raghib established his own branch of the Watani party in Jerusalem to counter this movement and the Husayni ambition."
POLITICS_AWNI_DESC:0 "A member of the Al Fatat since before the Great War, Awni assisted in the relief efforts in the Jordan Valley during the Officers Revolt of 1918. While other groups in the Jerusalem Vilyet rallied in the streets, Awni ensured that Yildirim never uncovered the Al Fatat members in Palestine. Now Awni finds himself in control of a vastly unprepared nation that barely knew of his work in the struggle for independence."
POLITICS_MUSA_AL_ALAMI_DESC:0 "Musa Al Alami was the son of the Mayor of Jerusalem, Faidi al-Alami. His upbringing in Jerusalem where Jewish and Muslim converge geve him an appreciation for a government that expedites trade and promotes economic prosperity. The waning power of the Ottomans made his continued allegiance to them impractical to these goals, so in 1926 Musa established Al-tanmiat to prepare cooperation with zionist groups. Non aggression agreements were honoured, and subusquent votes propelled Musa into office."
POLITICS_MUFTI_DESC:0 "The son of Jerusalem's mufti and a mortal enemy of the Nashashibi clan, Amin was always quick to deal. The Husayni family's ongoing anti zionist position was on the decline until Abraham Antebi was arrested by the Turks. Then sentiment began to turn in Amin's favour. Through dealmaking in Syria, Amin was able to provide homes for survivors of the 1918 Officers Revolt. The return of Antebi prooved to be another boon, as the Yildirim that accompanied Antebi began a campaign to destroy all political dissident in Palestine. Arabs in Palestine flocked to Amin, and he continued to make deals on their behalf all the way into office."
POLITICS_ANTEBI_DESC:0 "Albert Antebi spent the first 40 years of his life trying to mediate the Muslim Jewish divide in the Jerusalem Vilyet. When the Jewish Colonisation Association told him to buy land in Jerusalem for Jewish settlements, he always paid the Arab landowners a fair price. His goal of a peaceful creation of Israel was destroyed when he joined Mustafa Kemal in the Caucasus. After nearly dying in an Istanbul prison, Antebi was released as a bargaining chip of the Yildirm Army Group. He was given the ceremonial title of General Governor of Palestine, the first Jew to be honoured by the Ottomans in centuries, and held in Turkish custody as a virtual prisoner."
POLITICS_HILUPAL_DESC:0 "Radwan became General Secretary of the Palestine Arab Workers Society after the Third Internationale voted for and funded it's reestablishment. Before this, the PAWS was in severe danger of bankruptcy in Jerusalem, as the Yildirim had seized their assets following the return of Antebi. Radwan has suggested to the Internationale that the Yildirim would crumble without Antebi if he were to disappear. This became unnecessary as he died along with the Yildirim Officers in the liberation of the Near East."

POLITICS_PIUS_XII_DESC:0 "에우제니오 추기경 파첼리였던 교황 비오 12세는 위대한 영적 열정을 가진 사람입니다. 그는 그의 경건함으로 유명하지만, 사람들을 보호하고자 하는 열망이 아주 강한 권위주의적 성향을 가지고 있습니다."
POLITICS_STEPHEN_X_DESC:0 "엘리야 추기경 달라 코스타였던 교황 스테판 10세는 자선의 본성과 가난한 이들에 대한 사랑으로 온화한 남성 명성을 얻고 있습니다. 대부분은 그가 결국 교황을 국가의 직접 통치로부터 멀어지게 할 것이며, 이미 교황청 내에서 군대가 그 역할을 맡을지를 결정하기 위해 모일 것이라고 추측됩니다."
POLITICS_JOHN_XXIII_DESC:0 "아킬리스 추기경 리나르트였던 교황 요한 23 세는 교황으로서 논란의 여지가 있는 인물입니다. 그는 급진주의자라고 여겨지는 유명한 사회 주의자이며, 사회주의자들의 지지를 받아 북쪽과 화해하게 될 가능성 때문에 교황청에 의해 선택되었을 가능성이 있습니다."
POLITICS_JULIUS_IV_DESC:0 "알프레도 추기경 슈스터였던 교황 율리우스 4 세는 그의 열정으로 유명한 사람입니다. 그는 수 년 동안 로마 교황청의 운영에 관여해왔습니다. 그가 밀라노 대주교였을 시절, 그는 이미 생디칼리즘이 지구에서 박멸 될 때까지 싸워야 할 악이라고 선언한 바 있습니다."

POLITICS_POL_REGENCY_DESC:0 "Poland was reestablished by the Central Powers in formerly Russian lands after over a century of foreign rule. Competition between Austria and Germany for influence in Poland, both during and since the Weltkrieg, has left the regency council unable to perform its principle duty, the selection of a new monarch. The, so called, 'eternal regency' lords indecisively over a Poland which remains much the same as it was before the Weltkrieg - poor and restless."
POLITICS_ROMAN_DWOWSKI_DESC:0 "Roman Dmowski was a thorn in the side of Germany throughout the Weltkrieg. While many Polish nationalists embraced the Germans as liberators, Dmowski, wary of Germany's assimilation of Poles in its east, favoured the Entente. His Polish National Committee was recognized by the Entente as the legitimate government of Poland during the Weltkrieg. With German victory, Dmowkski was forced to agitate tactfully and in secret; now as head of state, Dmowski is poised to seek renewed Polish national glory."
POLITICS_WLADYSLAW_SIKORSKI_DESC:0 "Władysław Sikorski led legions of Polish volunteers against the Russian during the Weltkrieg; he proved a capable leader, but with the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Sikorski found himself and Poland betrayed by the very nations that labelled themselves its liberators. Following the war, Sikorski cemented his control of the newly established Polish military, and planned for a day when he could lead Poland into true independence. Now, it seems, that day has come; Sikorski has assumed control of the apparatus of the Polish state, and declared an end to foreign dominance."
POLITICS_POL_SEJM_DESC:0 "The Sejm is the lower house of the parliament of Poland. Historically, the Sejm was an assembly of clergy and nobility which, uniquely, elected the king of Poland. With no current head of state, the Sejm acts collectively as Poland's executive."
POLITICS_FELIKIS_DZIERZYNSKI_DESC:0 "Feliks Dzierzynski, former delegate to the Moscow Soviet, returned to Poland bitter from the defeat of the Bolshevik revolution. Undeterred, however, Dzierzynski, together with other Polish socialists, established a clandestine revolutionary movement in Warsaw which quickly spread throughout Poland. Dzierzynski, as head of state, shepherds Poland for the fulfillment of his socialist ideals."
POLITICS_FRYDERYK_KRYSTIAN_SASKI_DESC:0 "Fryderyk Krystian Saski, born Friedrich Christian von Wettin, king of Saxony, has ascended to the Polish throne. Fryderyk Krystian's status as both king of a constituent state of the German Empire and Poland is alarming to many Poles, who think him subservient to the Kaiser. Subservient or not, Fryderyk Krystian's coronation does indicate increased German influence in Poland."
POLITICS_KAROL_OLBRACHT_HABSBURG_DESC:0 "Karol Olbracht Habsburg-Lothringen, Austrian by birth, is a stalwart advocate of Polish independence. When Emperor Karl plotted to annex Polish lands to Austria, Karol Olbracht advocated fiercely against it. Though amicable to his native Austria, as king of Poland, Karol continues to fight for the Polish people."
POLITICS_MENDOG_III_DESC:0 "Born Karl Gero von Urach, the son of Wilhelm Karl, Duke of Urach, Mindaugas III, Mendog in Polish, ascended to the throne of Lithuania with his father's death in 1929. Though he bears the name of the first king of Lithuania, unifier and folk hero, Mindaugas III is not concerned with the people he reigns over at all - they are foreigners to him, and he to them. Despite this, Mindaugas has now also been crowned king of Poland, ending decades of deadlock in what became known as Poland's 'eternal regency'."
POLITICS_AUGUSTYN_I_CZARTORYSKI_DESC:0 "Augustyn Józef Czartoryski, though not a descendant of any historical Polish monarch, has been enthroned as its new king. The Czartoryski family, ethnically Polish, were influential both in the days of the old Commonwealth and following Russian annexation. With Augustyn, the new Polish nation at last has a truly Polish king."
POLITICS_THE_TSAR_OF_ALL_RUSSIANS_DESC:0 "Poland, just as in the past, is under the control of Russia. Though careful to maintain the facade of independence, Poland is in effect a Russian puppet."
POLITICS_EUSTACHY_SAPIEHA_DESC:0 "Eustachy Sapieha has emerged victorious in Poland's latest elections. Sapieha is a monarchist; though, he has clarified that the monarchy shall only be restored with the consent of Poland's people. Sapieha himself rules much like a monarch; he is paternalistic and supportive of the aristocracy."
POLITICS_MIECZYSLAW_MICHALOWICZ_DESC:0 "Mieczysław Michałowicz, once a socialist, became disillusioned with leftism by the Bolshevik revolution. Michałowicz now champions individual liberty and the free exchange of goods typical of western liberals. Michałowicz has vowed, as president, to preserve Poland's democracy and the freedom of its people."
POLITICS_STANISLAW_WOJCIECHOWSKI_DESC:0 "Stanisław Wojciechowski, a political ally of Alexander Kerensky during the early days of the Russian Provisional Government, has achieved electoral victory in Poland. Wojciechowski, a self-described socialist, shuns the revolutionary ideas of the Communards and other syndicalist movements, and instead advocates liberal democracy with consideration and concern for all."
POLITICS_KAROl_RADEK_DESC:0 "Karol Radek, once the pariah of the Polish socialist movement, rose to prominence by acting as a liaison between Vladimir Lenin and radical German socialist elements. Radek fought alongside Lenin and Dzierzynski in the Russian civil war, and eventually returned with Dzierzynski to Poland, determined to rekindle the flame of socialism. With Dzierzynski's passing, Radek has emerged as his successor."
POLITICS_JAKUB_HANECKI_DESC:0 "Jakub Hanecki was the chief financial minister of the Bolsheviks from Lenin's return to Russia until the bitter defeat of the revolution. He fled the collapsing Soviet Russia under the cover of darkness, bringing with him troves of financial documentation and ledgers linking various foreign socialists to the revolution, and thus saving many from imprisonment or worse. Hanecki, with the death of Dzierzynski, has triumphed over his political rivals. He intends to inject much needed fiscal responsibility into the new socialist Polish government."
POLITICS_ROZA_LUKSEMBURG_DESC:0 "Róża Luksemburg's reputation precedes her; she is considered by many to the ideological progenitor of an entirely new strain of Marxism. Luksemburg, a Leninist, criticized the lack of internal democracy within the old Bolshevik party. She also advocates the necessity of a world socialist revolution; such is the only way, she argues, to secure the revolution at all."
POLITICS_ADAM_DOBOSZYNSKI_DESC:0 "Adam Doboszynski is a moralist, even the by the standards of his party. Doboszynski argues that both Marxism and capitalism destroy the moral fabric of society. The only way, to Doboszynski, to assure the integrity of human beings is to strengthen the morality of society."
POLITICS_TADEUSZ_BIELECKI_DESC:0 "Tadeusz Bielecki, personal secretary to Roman Dmowski, has succeeded his now deceased boss as president of Poland. Bielecki adheres closely to Dmowski's political platform; just like Dmowski, he strives for the return of Poland to geopolitical prominence through both development and the acquisition of new territory."
POLITICS_POL_REGENCY_2_DESC:0 "With the death of the king, Poland is again ruled by a regency council. Wary of a return to the turmoil of the 'eternal regency', Poles anxiously await the coronation of a new monarch."
POLITICS_LUDWIK_PIOTR_I_CZARTORYSKI_DESC:0 "Ludwik Piotr Czartoryski, despite being a child, has directly succeeded his father as king of Poland. A comical image of the young king teething on the ancient crown, which was placed over his too-small head, has not helped assuage concerns that he is as of yet incapable of ruling."

POLITICS_MENDOG_III_PLC_DESC:0 "Born Karl Gero von Urach, the son of Wilhelm Karl, Duke of Urach, Mindaugas III, Mendog in Polish, ascended to the throne of Lithuania with his father's death in 1929. Though he bears the name of the first king of Lithuania, unifier and folk hero, Mindaugas III is not concerned with the people he reigns over at all - they are foreigners to him, and he to them. Despite this, Mindaugas has also been crowned king of Poland, and now a renewed union of his two kingdoms, ending decades of deadlock in what became known as Poland's 'eternal regency'."
POLITICS_ADAM_DOBOSZYNSKI_PLC_DESC:0 "Adam Doboszynski is a moralist, even the by the standards of his party. Doboszynski argues that both Marxism and capitalism destroy the moral fabric of society. The only way, to Doboszynski, to assure the integrity of human beings is to strengthen the morality of society."
POLITICS_FELIKS_DZIERZYNSKI_PLC_DESC:0 "Feliks Dzierzynski, former delegate to the Moscow Soviet, returned to Poland bitter from the defeat of the Bolshevik revolution. Undeterred, however, Dzierzynski, together with other Polish socialists, established a clandestine revolutionary movement in Warsaw which quickly spread throughout Poland. Dzierzynski, as head of state, shepherds Poland-Lithuania for the fulfillment of his socialist ideals."

POLITICS_DUARTE_BRAGANCA_DESC:0 "왕정 복고 이전에 망명 중인 왕족들이 서명한 도버 조약에서 합의한 바대로, 두아르테 2세는 후사가 없던 마누엘 2세로부터 왕위를 물려받았습니다. 1932년 왕위에 오른 뒤, 두아르테 왕은 정부와 그럭저럭 우호적인 관계를 유지하는 한에서 브라질 황실과 캐나다에 망명 중인 영국 왕실과의 유대 관계를 강화하기 위해 노력해 왔습니다."
POLITICS_MARIA_ADLEAIDE_BRAGANCA_DESC:0 "30년 만에 두 번째 여왕의 자리에 오른 마리아 3세는 자신보다 앞선 과제를 회피해 왔습니다. 어린 여왕은 공주였을 때부터 항상 인기있었고, 항상 가능할 때마다 도움이 필요한 사람들을 도와주기 위해 애썼습니다. 그녀의 온화하고 조신한 이미지와는 달리, 그녀는 왕위에 오른 직후 반-통합주의자라는 인식을 무릅쓰고 당의 과도한 활동을 비난해 왔고, 오직 그녀의 두려움 없는 태도만이 그녀의 인기를 돕습니다."
POLITICS_MARIA_PUPPET_DESC:0 "As the recently installed Queen of Portugal and the Algarves, Maria Ana I seems content in her role of doing little actual ruling. Her priority is ensuring the preservation of the Monarchy and in restoring ties with the deposed royal family. Her husband's German nationality, once a liability that essentialy locked her out of inheritance, may very well help in this endeavour"
POLITICS_ALEXANDRE_VIEIRA_DESC:0 "Alexandre Vieira is perhaps Portugal's most prestigious and respected leftist leader, which a marked and distingushed career dating back to the early years of the Republic. After being forced into exile in France after the Integralist takeover in 1926, said respect and former contacts, especially among anarchists and syndicalists, may be key to forming a stable coalition as the dust settles from the fall of the monarchy"
POLITICS_JOSE_CARLOS_RATES_DESC:0 "A veteran in the harsh struggle for Portugal's workers, Jose Carlos Rates entered the political scene in the first years of the republic as a syndicalist leader; however one that strayed far from the anarchist mainstream of Portuguese Syndicalists. Founder of the Portuguese Maximalist Federation, Rates believes in cooperating against imperalism in a wide front, but will likely have issues implementing Totalism in Portugal"
POLITICS_BENTO_ANTONIO_GONCALVES_DESC:0 "Bento is a long time syndical leader, entering the political arena in the waning years of the Weltkrieg as the conditions for Portuguese workers worsened. As syndicalist repression grew, in 1925 he was forced to flee Portugal after a failed strike, which seeked to emulate the English Revolution in Portuguese soil. Now returned after decades of exile, Bento has the daunting task of recovring Portugal ahead of him"
POLITICS_ANTONIO_RESENDE_DESC:0 "A staunch republican, Antonio was agressive in its attacks against the restoration in 1922, which forced him into exile after he alledgedly advocated for regicide, an accusation he to this day claims to be false. Exile has not been kind to public memory of the Porto politician, but no leadership arose in the PRED that can claim his ideological intensity or credibility, even as he is thankful for those who kept the flame of Republicanism alive in these dark years"
POLITICS_AFONSO_COSTA_DESC:0 "A leading figure in the First Republic, Afonso Costa has been long been deeply involed with the republican cause in Portugal, and he was one of the architects of that first revolution. The last leader of the former Republic, his prestige was kept intact even after decades of exile in multiple countries, and there is hope that this republic learns from the mistakes of the past. However, the man's advanced age and illing health may very well put said plans in jeorpardy"
POLITICS_ANTONIO_GRANJO_DESC:0 "Antonio's current leadership of Portuguese Liberal Republicans very well stems for his actions, for he was one of the few who actively attempted to stop the Restoration by taking up arms and urging others to do the same. The years in exile have not been kind to the politician, whose sexagenarian appearance may very well be unfamiliar to those used to the image of the man who attempted to defend the Republic."
POLITICS_JOAO_CANTO_CASTRO_DESC:0 "The aging admiral's beliefs may seem paradoxical to foreigners, as he has far more in common with monarchists than republicans in Portugal's political areana. However, as he is once again deemed the only man fit to leader, he will try his utmost to be a competent captain of Portugal for one last time, and endeavour to crush those who wish to end Portugal as a nation from whithin such as Iberists and Integralists"

POLITICS_OSMAN_ALI_KHAN_DESC:0 "Prince Osman Ali Khan, once but a subject of the mighty British Empire, united the southern Princely States in the chaos following the dissolution of the British Raj. Under his leadership, the fledgling Princely Federation routed socialist invaders and internal fifth-columnists alike, and thus prevented a Dominionist attack. As the Federation has matured, however, difficulties have arisen regarding the very nature of the nation's government. Osman Ali Khan must now guide the Federation from the deadly grasp of its many encumbrances and into a more stable tomorrow."
POLITICS_KRISHNA_WADIYAR_IV_DESC:0 "Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV, Prince of Mysore, is a scholar at heart. Renowned for his great collections of music and literature, and singular amongst Indian lords for his patronage of higher-learning, Krishna Raja Wadiyar yearns for enlightenment. His vision of an Indian 'city-on-a-hill' however, was nearly dashed with the end of the British Empire and turmoil that followed. Now, as leader of the Princely Federation, he strives to illuminate southern India, and perhaps one day, the entire sub-continent."
POLITICS_JAYACHAMARAJENDRA_WADIYAR_V_DESC:0 "Jayachamarajendra Raja Wadiyar V, Prince of Mysore, has succeeded his erudite uncle to the throne of Mysore, and now, the Princely Federation itself. Jayachamarajendra, much like his uncle, is an academic. Unlike his patron predecessor, however, he is himself a noteworthy artist. Jayachamarajendra seeks to paint all of India, not just the Federation, into a harmonious mosaic incorporating the subcontinent's many peoples and ways of life; through skillful policy, his idealic fantasies may yet be in reach."

POLITICS_CORNELIU_ZELEA_CODREANU_DESC:0 "The Conducător, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, is the undisputed leader of the populist Iron Guard and leader of Romania. A fanatic nationalist, he seeks to unite all lands inhabited by Romanians, from Transylvania to Dobrogea, and throw off the German yoke once and for all."

POLITICS_BORIS_SAVINKOV_DESC:0 "극단적인 민족주의자이자 인민당원인 '나로드노-레스부샤 파르티야 로시이'와 '전투 부대'로 알려진 과격한 준군사 조직의 지도자 보리스 비크토로비치 사빈코프는 원래 사회주의 혁명 정당의 주도적인 당원이었으며, 그 당의 우익 세력을 러시아 인민 공화당으로 유인했습니다. 노련한 작가이자 선동 정치가인 사빈코프는 좌파의 약함에 대한 강한 증오심을 품고 있고 러시아를 그것의 영웅적인 반응으로 복원하려는 거창한 꿈을 가지고 있습니다."
POLITICS_DMITRI_ROMANOV_DESC:0 "러시아의 마지막 차르 니콜라이 2세의 사촌이자 러시아 귀족들 사이에서 가장 영향력 있는 인물인 드미트리 파블로비치는 러시아 정계를 매우 쉽게 주무릅니다. 폭넓은 인맥과 그의 지인들이 국제 관계에서 그를 기꺼이 돕습니다. 그러나 그의 국내 정책에서의 능력 부족은 그의 매력과 인격에 의해서 겨우 가려지고 있는 상황입니다."
POLITICS_DMITRI_ROMANOV_TSAR_DESC:0 "러시아와 외국 귀족들 간의 수많은 관계는 드미트리 차르가 타국의 외교관들 및 정부와 확고한 외교 관계를 맺는데 도움을 주고, 언론에 대한 그의 뛰어난 이해도 역시 긍정적인 대중적 이미지를 형성하는데 있어서 유리함을 줍니다. 그러나 그의 국내 정책에서의 능력 부족은 그의 매력과 인격에 의해서 겨우 가려지고 있는 상황입니다."
POLITICS_PAVEL_II_DESC:0 "아버지의 사망 당시에 겨우 12살이었던 어린 파벨 2세는 섭정 의회의 꼭두각시가 될 가능성이 매우 높습니다. 그럼에도 불구하고, 그가 최소한 그의 아버지의 매력 중 일부를 유전받았다는 사실은 분명한데, 그렇기에 만약 충분한 정치적 능력만 갖춘다면, 언젠가 그에게 독립적인 통치의 기회가 주어질지도 모릅니다."
POLITICS_KYRIL_ROMANOV_CON_DESC:0 "러시아의 모든 정치 세력의 합의에 의해 복위된, 차르 키릴 로마노프는 갱신된 헌법에 의해 제한된 그의 권력의 많은 한계를 받아들여야만 했습니다. 그는 새로운 상황에 빠르게 적응했지만, 그의 오래된 정치적 견해와 내계 관계에 대한 가치관은 필연적으로 그와 정부 사이의 긴장을 유발할 가능성이 높습니다."
POLITICS_KYRIL_ROMANOV_ABS_DESC:0 "20년간의 공화정 이후에 전제군주정이 복원된 지금, 키릴 황제는 강력하고 권위적인 군주의 전통적인 이미지를 가진, 로마노프 황가의 마지막 후계자입니다. 러시아 국민들은 수년 간의 무정부 상태가 마침내 끝나기를 희망하고 있지만, 국제 정계는 복위된, 어쩌면 공격적인 차르를 경계하면서, 의심의 눈으로 현재 상황을 주시하고 있습니다."
POLITICS_VLADIMIR_ROMANOV_CON_DESC:0 "혁명 이후의 로마노프 일원인 블라디미르는 그의 아버지보다 더 헌법주의에 대해 완전히 새로운 견해를 가지고 있습니다. 재치있고 온화한 사람인 그는 러시아가 또 다른 혁명에서 살아남지 못할수도 있다는 것을 이해하고 러시아의 안녕을 목표로 하는 모든 세력과 기꺼이 협력할 것입니다."

With the collapse of the United Kingdom the following year, Hertzog declared the independence of South Africa and seized the British colonies of Bechuanaland and South Rhodesia.

Michel was unable to form trade unions in Damascus or Mosul, so he returned to Paris in 1930 abandoning the Ba'ath party. His return as of late as an emanciaptor and the forced creation of a trade union council in Damsacus means his power is backed up by his superiors in the Internationale more than it is backed by Syrian supporters.

POLITICS_PHILIP_SNOWDEN_DESC:0 "온화한 성품의 자작은 처음엔 영국 노동 조합 총회의 의장직에 거의 오르지 못하는 듯 보였지만, 어찌 되었든 그는 현직 의장이며, 그의 당파 파벌로부터 맹렬한 지지를 받습니다. 스노든의 승리는 노동 조합 회의의 분열을 최대한 피하려는 그의 결정과, 그가 편파적이지 않고 중립적인 후보로 보인 것에 기인했습니다. 그가 의장직에 오른 이래로 스노든 의장은 노동조합총회의 세대 교체를 보았습니다. 하지만 그는 거의 언제나 영국의 혁명 이후의 모든 파벌들 사이에서 중립을 지켜 왔습니다. 언제나 가장 높은 자리에서, 서로가 사소한 모욕으로 시간을 낭비하는 것을 막아주던 이 전직 자유주의자 생디칼리스트는 오랜 시간 동안 혼란한 시기를 지탱해왔지만, 1936년 노동 조합 회의가 다가오자 스노든은 불편한 현실인 그의 은퇴 의사를 밝혔습니다."

POLITICS_OSWALD_MOSLEY_DESC:0 "Oswald Mosley, left with a permanent limp from a flying accident during the Weltkrieg, entered into British politics a conservative. By the outbreak of the British Revolution, however, Mosley famously crossed the floor of parliament to stand with the revolutionaries of the Independent Labour Party.\n\nMosley, despite his physical impairment, quickly became perhaps the most passionate orator on the left. His firebrand speeches, particularly his famous address before the conservative workers of Birmingham, propelled Mosley to the forefront of the Trade Union movement, and eventually leadership of the governing TUC.\n\nMosley, founder of the authoritarian Maximist faction of the TUC, is a vocal exponent of increased centralization, and aggressive foreign policy."
POLITICS_NICLAS_GLAIS_DESC:0 "Niclas Y Glais and the poetry, both in English and Welsh, he penned regarding the struggles of the working class, inspired many typically conservative rural laborers to embrace the British Revolution; his Welsh translation of the British anthem “The Red Flag” is sung by Welsh socialists of all stripes.\n\nDespite fierce opposition, Glais advocates both on the floor of the Trade Union Congress, and through his poetry, the devolution of power from the TUC to workers' assemblies in Wales and Scotland. The people of these regions, he argues, are both culturally different from that of England and currently politically underrepresented. With Glais as chairman of the Trade Union Congress, power is likely to be increasingly decentralised."
POLITICS_ANNIE_KENNEY_DESC:0 "Annie Kenney, imprisoned by the old regime of Britain for militant women's suffrage activism, convinced many of the working women of Britain to join the Trade Union movement in the prelude to the British Revolution. Her advocacy massively inflated support for the revolution, and subsequently pressured the new socialist government to grant political rights to women.\n\nOriginally run as candidate for TUC chair by the pacifist Congregationist faction in protest of the TUC's alleged failure to secure equality between men and women, through cooperation with the more orthodox Federationist faction, Kenney has become the first chairwoman of the TUC."
POLITICS_TOM_MANN_DESC:0 "Tom Mann, the famous first General Secretary of the Trade Union Congress, has been appointed as chairman of the TUC following electoral gridlock. Mann, though a Leninist, has shown great historical commitment to the Trade Union movement and a dedicated spirit of civil service. Mann, in his old age, however, has indicated that he does not intend to stand for re-election."
POLITICS_TE_LAWRENCE_DESC:0 "Thomas Edward Lawrence, the famous officer and archaeologist who unsuccessfully led the Arab tribes in rebellion against the Ottoman Empire during the Weltkrieg, has led a coup against the government of the Union of Britain. Lawrence, charismatic yet reserved, has made ambiguous promises to the British people regarding Britain's future. While his past dedication to the Syndicalist cause is undeniable, many speculate that he harbours monarchist sympathies."
POLITICS_CLEM_ATTLEE_DESC:0 "Clem Attlee, shocked and disgusted by the poverty he witnessed while working at youth charity, became a prominent figure within the Independent Labour Party, and eventually the Trade Union movement. His activism, however, was cut short by the Weltkrieg.\nAttlee served on multiple fronts during war, and was eventually promoted to the rank of major. While Attlee's army service did instil in him a strong work ethic, it only entrenched his opposition to rigid hierarchy.\n\nAttlee, in British politics, is an ally, but not formal member of, the Autonomists."
POLITICS_BARBARA_CASTLE_DESC:0 "Barbara Castle, as a girl of only fifteen, led the children of her secondary girls' school in a rising in support of the British Revolution. The quirky red-haired girl quickly became a cultural icon throughout the newly established Union of Britain.\nAs she grew into a young woman, Castle again came into the public eye as the first female leader of the Oxford Students' Union, and never again left it. She became an increasingly vocal Congregationist, and eventually challenged the leadership of the admittedly magnanimous Annie Kenney.\n\nAs chairwoman of the TUC, Castle has vowed to fight the injustices that still plague the Union of Britain, especially inequities between men and women."
POLITICS_ERIC_BLAIR_DESC:0 "Eric Blair, the famous writer who helped propel his long-time ally Oswald Mosley to political prominence, came gradually to oppose Mosley. At every opportunity, Mosley seemed to tread upon the principles of the Union of Britain and the revolution which created it.\n\nBlair, with political triumph over his old friend, has vowed to restore to the people of Britain the freedoms Mosley so egregiously stripped from them."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_GALLACHER_DESC:0 "William Gallacher founded the Labour Withholding Committee in opposition to the Weltkrieg era Munitions Act. Jailed in his native Glasgow for undermining the war effort, Gallacher became increasingly radicalised. Upon release from prison, Gallacher joined the Glasgow Trades Council, part of the greater British Trade Union Movement, and organised it into an effective militia force during the revolution.\n\nGallacher, though initially opposed to Niclas y Glais's devolution efforts, has become satisfied with the current state of affiars."

POLITICS_CARLOS_ALBERTO_BRENES_DESC:0 "Carlos Alberto Brenes, a former ally of Guardia Nacional leader, Anastasio Somoza García, assumed the presidency following a compromise between American-backed agricultural interests and the Guardia. While he maintains some degree of independence from the Guardia Nacional, he is both unwilling and unable to curtail its pervasive political influence."
POLITICS_JUAN_BAUTISTA_SACASA_DESC:0 "Juan Bautista Sacasa is the new reformist president of the United Provinces. His Partido Liberal oppose the corruption and political violence so common under the Guardia Nacional controlled regimes of the past. With Sacasa's election, the United Provinces will almost certainly become a more free and democratic nation."

POLITICS_JACK_REED_DESC:0 "작가이자 노동 조합 지도자, 상원 의원, 언론인, 그리고 생디칼리스트. 존 '잭' 리드를 나타내는 단어는 이처럼 많습니다. 전임자인 알렉산더 버크먼이 사망한 후, 이 열정적인 급진 사회주의자는 미국의 생디칼리즘 운동을 주도했으며, 그 단체를 큰 성공으로 이끌었습니다. 언론인에서 대통령으로 가는 이 긴 길에서 그는 많은 적이 생겼지만, 많은 동맹이 생기기도 했습니다. 그는 프랑스 코뮌을 창건한 세바스티앙 포레의 미국 버전이 되어 카리스마 넘치고 통합된 생디칼리즘 선동가로 이 나라를 완벽하게 만들기로 결심했습니다."
POLITICS_JOHN_NANCE_GARNER_DESC:0 "친구들에 의해 '선인장 잭'으로 알려진 존 낸스 가너 4세는 텍사스 출신의 변호사이며 하원 의원으로 오랫동안 지냈던 미국의 새 대통령입니다. 그는 민주당 지지자이며, 약간 보수적인 정치인입니다. 그리고 가장 중요한 것은 그가 민주주의의 열렬한 지지자라는 것입니다. 이 텍사스 출신 판사는 좌파나 우파와 타협할 이유는 없다고 생각합니다."
POLITICS_HERBERT_HOOVER_DESC:0 "전 미국 상무부 장관이자 현재 미국의 대통령인 허버트 후버는 미국 역사상 가장 미움받는 사람 중 한 사람으로서 그 자리를 굳혔습니다. 첫 임기 동안 대공황을 더 심각하게 만들기만 했던 것에도 불구하고, 1932년 하원을 통해 재선된 것은 광범위한 분노를 불러일으켰습니다. 대통령에게 있어서 슬픈 현실입니다. - 경제를 회복시키려는 그의 모든 시도는 실패했고, 상황을 진정시키려는 노력은 상황을 더 악화시킬 뿐이며, 그의 당마저 그를 외면하고 있습니다."
POLITICS_DOUGLAS_MACARTHUR_DESC:0 "외국 정부들과 자신의 국민들에게 미움받는, 미합중국의 첫번째 독재자인 총사령관 맥아더는 약하지 않습니다. 급진주의 국가들을 제거하기 위해 미국 지배층의 부름을 받아서 온 이 장군은 국가를 자신의 연대를 지휘하듯이 다스립니다 - 질서와 엄격한 규율 그리고 그에게 반대하는 모두에 대한 강력한 처벌을 통해서 말입니다. 그는 자신이 진정으로 미합중국을 구하기 위해 이곳에 왔다고 믿고 있지만, 건국의 아버지들은 그의 행동을 지지할까요?"
POLITICS_HUEY_LONG_DESC:0 "루이지애나 주지사인 휴이 롱이 정확히 어떤 사람인지 말하기는 어렵습니다. 일부 사람들은 그의 '재산 공유' 계획이 새로운 옷을 입은 생디칼리즘이라고 말하는 반면, 다른 이들은 그의 비민주적, 족벌주의적 정치 방식과 경쟁자를 제거하기 위해 준군사단체 '미니트맨'을 사용하는 것이 그의 국가포퓰리즘적 자세의 신호라고 지적합니다. 어찌됐건, 롱 대통령은 서민들의 사랑을 받고 있으며, 때로는 오만하게 보일 수도 있지만 그의 카리스마는 이례적이며 남부에서의 입지는 과소평가될 수 없습니다."

POLITICS_VLADIMIR_DESC:0 "King Uladzimir von Hohenzollern, nephew of Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany, though German by birth, has largely assimilated into Ruthenian culture. Though his adopted nation is poor, and by German standards quite backwards, it is rapidly modernising. With an increasingly uncertain political climate both in Belorussia and abroad, Uladzimir seeks to lead his country and people into a brighter future while mitigating the influence of political radicals."
POLITICS_SIGISMUND_I_DESC:0 "King Žyhimont von Hohenzollern, former head of the Ruthenian national security service and brother of ex-king Uladzimir, has assumed control of Belorussia. He is closely linked to Belarusian ultra-nationalists, and supports the forced assimilation and persecution of minority groups within Belorussia."
POLITICS_VACLAU_LASTOUSKI_DESC:0 "Vaclaŭ Lastoŭski is a relatively moderate syndicalist, who seeks lasting compromise with both social democrats and leninists. By through industrialisation and expansion of the Ruthenian military, he hopes to free his country from German domination."
POLITICS_BRANISLAU_TARASKIEVIC_DESC:0 "Branislaŭ Taraškievič is a dedicated leninist with nearly as much disdain for syndicalism as the bourgeoisie themselves. In is a dedicated leninist with nearly as much disdain for syndicalism as the bourgeoisie themselves. In Taraškievič's view, the state must assume control of all aspects of life in Belorussia to ensure a transition to a truely classless society."

POLITICS_YAHYA_HAMID_DESC:0 "From 1934 to 1948, Yahya redirected his energies toward internal consolidation of his authority and the creation of a viable central government, answerable to him personally. To this end, control of the hinterland was strengthened by the establishment of a standing army and the naming of his sons as governors of key provinces. Tighter control over affairs in Sana'a, the capital, was assured by expanding the scope of administrative functions and appointing other sons as supervisors of old and new political institutions . The regime sent Yemen's first students abroad military cadets to the ottomans in the 1930s and civilian students, the Famous Forty, to Egypt in the late 1940s. An early attempt was made to introduce some direction to the nascent national economy by the establishment of a Yemen trading company. Even with these changes, Yahya's Yemen was a semi-feudal state in which even the most basic measures required his personal approval."
POLITICS_ALI_NASSAR_AL-QADARI_DESC:0 "The son of Sheikh Nasser bin Mas'ad. Ali Nasser had a common background. As a sunni, he took up rebellion against Imam Yahya in 1928 when the Imam has imposed his rule over Aden. Al Nasser then fled the Imam's draft, and joined the rebels. The rebellion saw Ali Nasser tap into his artisitc side, waxing poetic about his mission to kill the Imam. To this end, he joined the underground Hait al-Nadial organization, and through his expressive voice became their leader."
POLITICS_SHABAB_AL-AMR_DESC:0 "Out of Ta'izz, the Numan family could be described as middle class. As a sunni, Ahmad could not attain a proper education in muslim science to advance in Yemen. This may have been due to rumors that his family was descended from Yemeni Jews. Instead, Ahmad was educated in western logic at the al Madrassa al Ahliyya. This school eventually played host to Ahmad's reform group Nadi a Islah. The Nadi a Islah saw both the Mutawakkili kingdom and the Ottoman Caliphate as relics that held back Yemen. He formed a program that disguised social reforms behind the terminology of ractionaries. Promoting the Good and Preventing the Bad was allowed his rebellion to sway otherwise conservatives Yemenis. Ultimately, this proclemation for Yemen was to ease change into a country badyl divided. "

POLITICS_OTTO_DESC:0 "오토 폰 합스부르크-로트링겐 황제가 오스트리아의 군주인 그의 아버지 카를의 뒤를 이었습니다. 오토는 젊은 나이에도 불구하고, 서로 다른 민족들이 하나의 국가 정체성을 공유하는 통합 제국의 원대한 야망을 가지고 있습니다. 그의 간결한 연설과, 시끌벅적한 연애 관계, 그리고 청년 특유의 매력이 언론의 관심을 끌었고 오토의 인기는 절정에 달했습니다."

POLITICS_LALA_LAJPAT_RAI_DESC:0 "Lala Lajpat Rai, Punjabi Hindu philanthropist, returned from championing Indian independence in the United States to formulate the creation of a new socialist state in India. With the collapse of British rule in late 1925, Rai, along with other Indian socialist figureheads, proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of Bengal. While the People's Republic initially failed to unite India through force, it managed to consolidate its rule over the northeastern third of the sub-continent. Rai, once relatively secure in his leaderhsip of the People's Republic, renamed the Bharatiya Commune to indicate its ambition of unification, now faces spirited opposition from competing socialist factions. With his advanced age and waning influence, Rai has announced his intent to resign from his post. His successor may well determine the future of the Commune itself."
POLITICS_FAZLUL_HUQ_DESC:0 "Fazlul Huq, former secretary of the Bengali Muslim League, and now an avowed Syndicalist, has led his 'Moderate' faction to victory in the Indian National Congress's special session. He campaigned on a platform of trade-union centric industrialisation and the gradual implimenation of socialist reform. Despite electoral success, however, Fuq still faces staunch opposition from opposing factions of the Indian National Congress. Regardless, Fuq's vision of prosperity in the historically impoverished eastern India, and perhaps oneday the entire sub-continent, appears, at least to his supporters, to be increasingly achievable."
POLITICS_CHANDRA_BOSE_DESC:0 "As a boy, Subhas Chandra Bose once assaulted a British schoolmaster for defaming his beloved India; his expulsion thereafter left Bose with an almost rabid desire for vengance. Shortly before the collapse of the British Raj, Bose attracted large swaths of the Indian population to the socialist cause with incendiary speeches against the all who would deny India's people sole dominion over the sub-continent. With the success of Bose's Maximists within the Indian National Congress, the Bharatiya Commune as a whole has begun to assume a similarly militaristic outlook; it now looks to strike a decisive blow to the hearts of the Dominionists and Princely Federation alike."
POLITICS_MOHANDAS_GHANDI_DESC:0 "A former lawyer, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi valued highly the gradual, peaceful, and lawful independence of India from British rule. With the collapse of the Raj, however, he and his many followers were forced to reassess their position. Though still a propenent of pacifism, Ghandi has become increasingly influenced by the ideas of his colleagues in the now radicalised Indian National Congress. Ghandi's victory in the Indian National Congress's special session has awoken renewed hope for the peaceful reunification of the Indian sub-continent and the reconciliation of its divided factions."
POLITICS_JAWAHARLAL_NEHRU_DESC:0 "Jawaharlal Nehru is almost certainly the most tactful of the Bharatiya Commune's prominent political leaders. With the collapse of the British Raj, Nehru, while a staunch advocate for immediate independence from the weakened Empire, worked tireless to mediate all manner of disputes among Indian leaders across the political spectrum. While his detractors would slander Nehru as indecisive and cowardly, Nehru's subtle political manoeuvring was essential for his ascension to the highest levels of the Indian National Congress, and now the Bharatiya Commune itself. Under Nehru's leadership, perhaps the factionalism which has plagued the Congress for decades may finally be assauged."
POLITICS_NIRMAL_KUMAR_BOSE_DESC:0 "Nirmal Kumar Bose, protégé of the famous Mohandas Gandhi, has assumed leadership of the Bharatiya Commune. He is likely to continue the agrarian reforms of Ghandi, and encourage the non-violent reunification of India. Many dissidents within the Bharatiya Commune, however, are displeased with Bose's rise to power, believing, despite official explanations to the contrary, that Bose masterminded Ghandi's demise."
POLITICS_SHRIPAD_AMRIT_DANGE_DESC:0 "Shripad Amrit Dange is perhaps the most radical syndicalist within the Indian National Congress. Much like Nestor Makhno of the French Anarchistes, he advocates the eventual disestablishment of the very state itself. Unlike the Anarchistes however, rather than promoting rural collectivisation, Dange advocates industrialisation and the assumption by trade unions of the entire economic apparatus."

POLITICS_EDWARD_DESC:0 "에드워드 윈저는 그의 아버지, 조지 5세의 죽음과 함께 오타와에서 왕위를 계승했습니다. 엄숙히 즉위한 이 젊은 왕은 흔적만 남은 제국의 옛 영광과 생디칼리스트 혁명가들에게 점거당한 왕국을 물려받았습니다. 의심할 여지 없이 에드워드 왕은, 무엇보다도 유니온 잭이 다시 브리튼 제도 위를 당당하게 날아 오르기를 희망하고 있습니다."

POLITICS_ROBERT_POPHAM_DESC:0 "세계 대전기에 왕립 공군 장성이었던 로버트 브룩-폽햄이 캐나다의 총독으로 임명되었습니다. 브룩-폽햄은 항상 철저한 인물이었고 왕립 공군을 영국군의 독립된 군으로서, 그리고 이후에 캐나다의 군대로서 설립하는데 필수적인 인물이었습니다. 캐나다 총독에 그가 임명되면서, 자재 부족이 줄어들고 효율이 크게 증가했습니다. 이것은 명백히 에드워드 왕이 임명한, 영국 혁명 이후 캐나다의 첫번째 총독인 브룩-폽햄의 업적입니다."
POLITICS_FREDERICK_BANTING_DESC:0 "인슐린과 그 기능을 알아낸 최초의 인물인 명성있는 과학자 프레드릭 밴팅이 캐나다 총독으로 임명되었습니다. 연구자를 총독 자리에 앉힌다는 게 이상한 선택으로 보일 수도 있지만, 밴팅은 캐나다에서 매우 중요한 인물입니다. 영국 혁명으로 인한 혼란과 함께, 밴팅은 수천명의 영국 지식인들이 캐나다로 이민하고 그 후 캐나다 군사 연구 기구의 재편을 재편하는데 큰 도움을 주었습니다. 영국 재건을 감독하는 데 바쁜 에드워드 왕은 총독을 지명하는 문제를 캐나다 의회에 넘겼으며, 의회가 밴팅이라는 베테랑 행정가 및 공인을 지명한 것은 현명한 선택입니다."
POLITICS_GEORGES_VANIER_DESC:0 "영국 혁명 후 영국과 쿠바 간 긴장 완화를 담당하고 있는 프랑스계 캐나다 장군 조르주 바니에르가 캐나다 총독으로 임명되었습니다. 바니에르는 세계대전의 전장에서 오른쪽 다리를 잃고 군사 행정에 시달리면서 머리가 하얗게 센 참전 용사입니다. 바니에르는 많은 캐나다인들, 프랑스계 캐나다인들과 특히 퀘벡인들에게 의무를 상징하는 아이콘입니다. 바니에르는 영어와 프랑스어 모두를 유창하게 구사하며 무엇보다도 캐나다에 충성합니다. 영국 재건을 감독하는 데 바쁜 에드워드 왕은 총독을 지명하는 문제를 캐나다 의회에 넘겼으며, 의회가 바니에르를 지명한 것은 합리적인 선택입니다."

POLITICS_AUGUSTO_CESAR_SANDINO_DESC:0 "Augusto César Sandino has become more myth than man in Centroamérica. As the former leader of the Centroamérican revolution, he is seen as the father of the nation, a socialist messiah come to liberate the masses from the shackles of foreign occupiers and domestic strongmen alike."
POLITICS_JACOBO_GUZMAN_ARBENZ_DESC:0 "Jacobo Guzman Árbenz is, by Centroamérican standards, a political moderate. He espouses beliefs not too dissimilar from those of European Social Democrats. Until his party's triumph in the last Centroamérican Socialist Congressional Union, man believed he would be purged as a traitor to the revolution like so many others in Centroamérica."
POLITICS_FARABUNDO_MARTI_DESC:0 "Farabundo Martí is the Syndicalist former leader of then semi-autonomous El Salvador. He seeks to transform Centroamérica into a bastion of Communard style syndicalism. With syndicalist success at the Socialist Congressional Union, his dream may yet come to fruition."

POLITICS_SEBASTIEN_FAURE_DESC:0 "Sébastien Faure is the first Anarchiste to serve as Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Originally empowered to chairman in a compromise between the Travailleurs and Anarchistes, factionalism has grown considerably during his time in office, and the apparatus of the state has weakened. If any faction manages to gain a clear majority in the Comité de Salut Public and the Bourse Générale du Travail, Faure is likely to be ousted."
POLITICS_LEON_JOUHAUX_DESC:0 "Léon Jouhaux has been elected Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Jouhaux, as a revolutionary trade unionist, participated in the general strike of 1919 which precipitated the Commune's establishment. He is an adherent of orthodox French syndicalism, a true centrist among the factions of the Commune."
POLITICS_BENOIT_FRACHON_DESC:0 "Benoît Frachon, a veteran of the French Civil War, has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. While a Syndicalist, he is sympathetic towards the opposing anarchiste faction; to that end, he has declared mending the Commune's factionalism the chief goal of his chairmanship."
POLITICS_GAMELIN_DESC:0 "General Maurice Gamelin has overthrown the Jacobin regime of Marcel Déat. While his coup is an obvious affront to the already dubious Communard democratic process, many now regard Gamelin as the saviour of the Commune, and even syndicalism itself."
POLITICS_MARCEL_CACHIN_DESC:0 "Marcel Cachin, former diplomat and bureau chief of the state-owned newspaper, Humanité, has become chairman of the Commune of France. While a Leninist, his diplomatic attitude and general charisma, allow him to retain some degree cordialility with syndicalists and anarchists."
POLITICS_GEORGES_VALOIS_DESC:0 "Georges Valois, an adherent to the national-syndicalist teachings of Georges Sorel, has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. Valois advocates the unification of the chairmanships of the Bourse Générale du Travail and Comité de Salut Public, a precursor in the eyes of many Communards, to tyranny."
POLITICS_NESTOR_MAKHNO_DESC:0 "Nestor Makhno, Ukrainian anarchist, fled his homeland for France following German intervention in the Russian Civil War. Now, his firebrand denouncement of any and all state-authority has secured his French electoral victory. His radical vision of a nation, and perhaps world, without government of any kind, will likely not come to fruition in the forseeable future, but his support for decentralisation could forever transform the Commune."
POLITICS_JACQUES_DORIOT_DESC:0 "Jacques Doriot, veteran of the Weltkrieg, returned from captivity in Germany to find a France forever changed. His personal transformation from moderate socialist, to Leninist, and now national-syndicalist, has instilled in him an engrained proclivity for compromise."
POLITICS_VINCENT_AURIOL_DESC:0 "Vincent Auriol, long accused by hardline syndicalists of harbouring sympathies for the bourgeoisie, has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail. He advocates the gradual transition to a more democratic system of government in the Commune."
POLITICS_DANIEL_GUERIN_DESC:0 "Daniel Guérin has now not only usurped from the charismatic Nestor Makhno leadership of the Anarchiste faction of the French Commune, but also won the chairmanship itself. Guérin is an academic, and a moderate in comparison to Makhno, who has proven to be a capable lawmaker."
POLITICS_MARCEL_DEAT_DESC:0 "Marcel Déat has upended the Communard political system. A Leninist who has frequently made public his contempt for syndicalism, Déat stands in opposition to much of France's political establishment.

POLITICS_CHAMBER_OF_PRINCES_DESC:0 "The Chamber of Princes was originally established by King-Emperor George V during the Weltkrieg to appease the increasingly unruly Indian nobility. The instability and political violence that followed the British revolution necessitated that, to maintain authority, the unelected Chamber was delegated substantial governmental authority, and eventually reorganized into the proper upper-house of the now bi-cameral Indian legislature. Upon the death of the viceroy of India, the Chamber is responsible for appointing a successor."
POLITICS_GANGA_SINGH_DESC:0 "Ganga Singh, prince of Bikaner, proved a capable military leader during the Weltkrieg, eventually becoming the only Indian member of the British Imperial War Cabinet. Not just a military man however, Singh proved to be an astute politician, gaining a substantial following by advocating sweeping yet gradual reform of India's convoluted political system. In his push for reform however, Singh maintained cordiality with the British administration, and gained the admiration of sympathetic aristocrats. Due to his popularity, Singh's support was crucial for then Viceroy, Rufus Isaacs, in transforming India from an appendage of the British Empire into an independent Dominion."
POLITICS_BHIMRAO_RAMJI_AMBEDKAR_DESC:0 "Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, despite being born into the Dalit caste, was recognized as a prodigious student, and earned his place as a student of the most prestigious western universities. Inspired by western liberalism, Ambedkar ascended to the forefront of Indian politics on a platform of caste reconciliation. He seeks to promote the social standing of the Dalits without destroying India's social and political order."
POLITICS_RATANJI_DADABHOY_TATA_DESC:0 "Jehangir Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata, son of perhaps India's most famous industrialist, after whom Jehangir is named, fled his native Paris during the Weltkrieg, shortly before Germany captured the city. Upon arrival in Delhi, Jehangir's father fell increasingly ill, and Jehangir assumed control of the Tata business empire. Jehangir personally financed counter-insurgency operations in the wake of the break-up of the Raj, and in the process, became increasingly involved in Dominion politics, eventually being appointed as chief of the Indian national bank."
POLITICS_ATUL_CHANDRA_CHATTERJEE_DESC:0 "Atul Chandra Chatterjee, diplomat and moderate labor activist, served diligently in the British Raj's 'Indian Civil Service'; he was the British High Commissioner to India when the British Revolution struck, and upended India's political system. His efforts were pivotal to the establishment of the Dominion's foreign service, even personally managing most of his nation's diplomats when issues arose. Following Viceroy Ganga Singh's appointment, Chatterjee became even more prominent in India politics, even striking up a friendship with Singh. Chatterjee has been a vocal advocate of state protection of the rights of India's industrial laborers."
POLITICS_SRINIVASA_SASTRI_DESC:0 "Srinivasa Sastri, who founded the Indian Liberal Party after leaving the Indian National Congress, is renowned for negotiating a degree of autonomy for India shortly before the British Revolution. Sastri, though once nearly incarcerated for his association with the Indian Home Rule League, and not opposed to India's recent declaration of a republic, is quite an anglophile; he believes that the institutions established by the British should be maintained."
POLITICS_MINOCHER_MASANI_DESC:0 "Minocher Rustom Masani, a vocal proponent of classical liberalism, split with the Indian National Congress due to the Congress's drift towards socialism. Masani is a charismatic and good-natured man, who, despite policy disagreements, maintains personal friendships with many political rivals, even those of the Indian National Congress. Minocher similarly enjoys even the most mundane of political decision, often speaking for hours on end on the floor of parliament on the minutia of financial decisions and administrative budgets. Minocher's attention to detail and gregarious nature has won him a large political following."
POLITICS_NARASIMHA_KELKAR_DESC:0 "Narasimha Chintaman Kelkar split with the Indian National Congress due to the Congress's increasingly socialist stance. Shortly before the disintegration of the British Raj, Kelkar, and other more liberal Congress defectors founded the Swaraj (meaning independence or self-governance) Party to promote parliamentarian democracy in India. Kelkar is not only a man of politics, however; he is an accomplished playwright, and his works have been responsible for igniting increased national identity and political consciousness among the people of India."
POLITICS_BALASAHEB_KHER_DESC:0 "Balasaheb Gangadhar Kher, and accomplished lawyer, fled Bombay for Delhi in the chaos that followed the dissolution of the British Raj. Kher rose in political prominence by advocating for the protection of the rights of India's lower castes, and it is from these lower caste's that he draws the greatest support. Kher is known for his compassion for the less fortunate outside politics as well; he is known to personally involve himself in charitable endeavors, and is as likely to be found attending to his political duties, as assisting in the construction of a new orphanage or staffing a soup kitchen."
POLITICS_KANAIYALAL_MUNSHI_DESC:0 "Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi is an acclaimed author in his native Gujarat; his works cover a broad range of topics, including: law, Gujrati culture, and political theory. Though once a member of the Indian National Congress, Munshi bears a disdain for socialism, and abandoned the Congress due to its leftward drift. Munshi believes that to assure liberty for the people of India and safeguard against the encroachment of insidious socialist influence, property rights must be protected, while the estates of India's landed aristocracy must be broken up."
POLITICS_KRISHNA_MENON_DESC:0 "Krishna Menon, often accused of harbouring sympathies for socialism and the Indian National Congress, has nonetheless, become one of India's most prominent political figures. Menon is a masterful manipulator, playing the game of Indian politics much like a grandmaster would play a round of chess. With the death of his political ally, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Menon was forced to step out from the shadows, and become the face of the moderate left in India. Menon is as distrustful of the West as of political rivals, fearing any continued association with the remnants of the British Empire could lead India to ruin."
POLITICS_MUHAMMAD_ALI_JINNAH_DESC:0 "Muhammad Ali Jinnah, first entered into politics to promote the interests of India's Muslim minority. Jinnah organised the Lucknow Pact between feuding Muslim and Hindu independence leaders in 1916, and founded the All-India Homerule League during the Weltkrieg to advocate Indian self-determination. Following the Indian National Congress's drift towards socialism, Jinnah split from the congress to form a renewed Homerule League as a formal political party."
POLITICS_SIKANDER_KHAN_DESC:0 "Sikander Hayat Khan, Punjabi aristocratic and statesman, and his Unionist Party, have emerged victorious in India's latest presidential election. Khan began his political career as an ally of leftist Muhammad Jinnah, but drifted further from Jinnah with time. He joined the conservative Unionist Party, which had split from the Jinnah's Home Rule Party over dissatisfaction with Jinnah's leadership, and disagreement with the Party's endorsement of land redistribution; this split between Jinnah and Khan has created a political rift amongst Indian Muslims."
POLITICS_CHHOTU_RAM_DESC:0 "Chhotu Ram, after helping to found the Unionist Party, withdrew from politics to focus on social work. Ram's work led to a marked increase in the standard of living of some of the most destitute people of Punjab, and the name 'Chhotu Ram' was soon on the lips of a great many Indians. Upon his return to politics, Ram set out to reform the Unionist Party, which had evolved from an alliance of Punjabi Jats and Muslims into an organisation for the protection of the rural nobility of northern India."

He joined the conservative Unionist party based in his native Punjab and quickly rose to its leadership."

POLITICS_ADALBERT_I_DESC:0 "Adalbert von Hohenzollern's tenure as king of the Flems and Walloons has been quite peculiar. Inaugurated not by coronation, but by swearing an oath on the constitution, Adalbert, who also converted to Catholicism to align himself with his nation's populace, has long sought the respect, if not admiration, of his people. Years of oppression under the German regime and a tendency for Adalbert to cling on to a more absolutist type of monarchy than the Belgian system have led to great anti-German sentiment among the populace, making Adalbert despised and hated amongst the common folk."
POLITICS_ALBERT_I_DESC:0 "Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the king who trounced the invading Germans at the Yzer, has returned to Belgium from exile in Canada. When his motorcade entered Brussels for the first time since the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, church bells across the nation rang, and many Belgians weeped with joy. German collaborators and syndicalists, however, lament the restored king, and plot to undermine the new Belgian government. Albert must now mend the deep wounds which have marred Belgium, and create a renewed sense of hope among the its people."
POLITICS_JORIS_SEVEREN_DESC:0 "Joris Van Severen, Flemish leader who begrudgingly cooperated with the occupying Germans, has assumed control of the country. His Verdinaso has a radical vision for the direction of Belgium, including territorial expansion and the promotion of Catholicism in all aspects of society. Under van Severen, a new Belgium will certainly arise; though that new nation may be incredibly different from the one that came before it."
POLITICS_PAUL_ZEELAND_DESC:0 "Paul van Zeeland and the Catholic Party led Flemish resistance to German control. With electoral victory in the now restored Belgium, van Zeeland endeavours to establish Chistian Democracy in Belgium, and reconcile that which divides Belgium's people, Flems and Walloons alike. Principle among his policy goals is the betterment of working conditions for both farmers and industrial laborers."
POLITICS_BELGIAN_PARLIMENT_DESC:0 "The Belgian Parliament, successor to the Flemish Council which advised the German controlled government of Flanders-Wallonia, has assumed power in the recently restored Belgium.

POLITICS_HENRIK_MAN_DESC:0 "Henrik de Man, a moderate social democrat, has consolidated his leadership of the Belgian Workers' Party, and now achieved victory in Belgium's latest national elections. De Man advocates limited economic nationalisation and the empowerment of union leaders to a governmental advisory role. Belgium, De Man believes, must actively serve its people and promote fair competition; his reforms, though controversial, may yet decrease economic hardship and political radicalisation in Belgium."
POLITICS_JOSEPH_JACQUEMOTTE_DESC:0 "Joseph Jacquemotte, creator and editor of the leftist pre-Weltkrieg newpaper 'L'Exploité', and his Syndicalist faction of the Belgian Workers' Party have achieved victory both within the party, and now, Belgium itself. Jacquemotte advocates rural industrialisation and the collectvisation of industry and agriculture alike. A Belgium led by Jacquemotte is certain to see drastic societal and economic upheaval."
POLITICS_PAUL_HENRI_SPAAK_DESC:0 "Paul Henri Spaak, once a prominent lawyer, believes that, above all else, to truely serve the people, government bureaucracy must be efficient. Spaak is now in contol of the Belgian Workers' Party, and the party's subsequent victory in the most recent Belgian national elections has elevated him to head of state. Spaak has already begun to greatly decrease the bloated Belgian civil service and introduced new incentives to prospective entrepreneurs; as a result, optimism seems to be steadily increasing in Belgium."
POLITICS_PAUL_EMILE_JANSON_DESC:0 "Paul-Émile Janson and his Liberal Party has achieved victory in Belgium's latest national elections. Janson is an advocate of laissez faire economics and free trade; all aspects of society, to Janson, have been far too regulated by past administrations. Belgium, under Janson, is quickly becoming one of the most economically free nations in Europe and the world."

POLITICS_PHAM_VAN_DONG_DESC:0 "In 1924, Pham Van Dong travelled to southern China. There, he met Ho Chi Minh, and quickly became one of his most trusted confidants and leaders of men. He witnessed the tragic end of Vietnamese syndicalist movement and fled to France. In exile, he developed an interest in the ideology of French Jacobins, Vanguardism. The idea of a vanguard group of disciplined intellectuals leading the revolution captured him. After the split of the League in 1931, he founded Tan Viet party and started infiltrating the colony. Most of his colleagues find him forever diligent and energetic, a reliable and loveable person as well as an ideal organiser and administrator. On the other hand, his enemy fear his ability to run the party and state machine."
POLITICS_TA_THU_THAO_DESC:0 "This young radical almost shouldn't have been the chairman of the prestigious Indochinese Revolutionary League, but he is and he is well respected by his colleagues. Ta Thu Thau became a prominent activist in Saigon in the mid-1920s and joined the League in its darkest days. After the split in 1931 gave another heavy blow to the League, Ta Thu Thau rose to power. This sharp intellectual has intentionally modelled Ho Chi Minh's leading style since his assuming of the title of Chairman, trying to calm factional tensions and strengthen solidarity. The recovery of the League from the collapse largely credited to his efforts. Now, he is determined to achieve the unfulfilled dream of the martyrs——build syndicalism in Indochina."
POLITICS_NGUYEN_AN_NINH_DESC:0 "Nguyen An Ninh is respected by most Indochinese intellectuals as the true democratic soul of Indochina. He studied in Sorbonne and participated the French Revolution in 1919. In 1922, Nguyen An Ninh, Nguyen The Truyen and Nguyen Ai Quoc (Ho Chi Minh) met in Marseille and decided to plan the liberation of their motherland. Nguyen An Ninh returned to Indochina in 1924 and was arrested by German police for radical agitation. After witness the crackdown of Indochinese syndicalism, Nguyen An Ninh decided that Indochinese revolution must rely on the spontaneous uprising of peasants. Since then, he started the Aspiration Society, modelling on traditional secret societies. He often personally travels from village to village under the disguise of a monk or herbist, selling his self-made ointment, and secretly recruit members to sow the seeds of revolution. He thus won great popularity among peasants in the Mekong Delta. While his dream of complete transforming the personality of Indochinese people might not realise in the foreseeable future, his emphasis on cultural enlightenment, autonomy and spontaneity will deeply reshape Indochinese society."
POLITICS_NGUYEN_TAI_HOC_DESC:0 "Nguyen Tai Hoc is the founding leader of the Viet Nam Quo Dan Dang, the Vietnamese Nationalist Party. He was a supporter of colonial reformism, but later dissapointed at the empty promises of the colonial regime and became the leader of revolutionary nationalism. Although the Yen-Bai mutiny failed, his successful escape from German police after that tragedy adds another chapter in his heroic deeds. Influenced by Chinese revolutionary Sun Yat-sen, he envisages a democratic republic truly for people's welfare."

His father's tent now replaced with a palace far away from the harshness of his childhood. Abdulaziz Rashid now looks towards a the frontiers of traditional Arabia where his tribe can prosper. Abdulaziz Rashid proclaims that his dynasty will replace the authoritarian attitude of Wahabbism. At the same time however, salafists flock to Ha'il to pitch to Abdulaziz a renewal of Mu'taizilism that his sunni followers see as the next step in modernizing Islam."
POLITICS_GHAZI_DESC:0 "The only son of the late Faisal bin Hussein, Ghazi escaped the wrath of the Turks in Hejaz by hiding in El Esah with his cousin Zeid bin Hussein. In El Esah, Ghazi was cared for by the remaining forces of Lawrence's rebellion, but financial assistance from Britain dried up in 1926. This left Ghazi to seek protection from Ottoman soldiers with the Howietat. This led to a temporary truce between the Rashids and the Hashmites when the Howietat were admitted into Jabal Shammar. The influence of Ghazi's name is still strong, as well as the legacy of the Arab Revolt among Bedouins yearning for freedom. Thus it was Ghazi's triumphant return to Mecca after the fall of the Ottomans that restored the greatness of his name."
POLITICS_SAEED_DUBAI_DESC:0 "Where war and rivalry only led to the stagnation of Arabia, trade and deleation will restore. This came from a speech given by the Emir Saeed al Maktoum upon recieving his office. His term as Emir of Dubai was one of exemplary diplomacy and a care for his peoples' well being. Submission to the Sauds over a bloodbath in the 1920s, creation of economic ties to India when pearling failed the emirate, and finally a promise of peace. His dynasty being unilaterally more wealthy than the Rashids or Hashmitie may of helped as well."
POLITICS_SHAKBUT_IRQ_DESC:0 "The House Al Nahyan was stuck in the crossroads of the Saud Rashid war. Their cities taxed cruelly by the Sauds, and thier commerce stunted. This destruction resolved Shakhbut Al Nahyan to formulate an economic plan for recovery involving western economists. This plan was presented to the Emirs, and early sucesses paved the way to Shakhbut's election. Al Nahyan weaves in hsi speeches the tales of how his ancestors of the Bani Yas migrated to the coast and found a land suitable to grow. Shakhbut's personal repuation among the Emirs is outstanding, and is only corrupted by the schemes of his own family. Shakhbut is confident that his repuation can save him from the macinations of family politics."
POLITICS_ABTAN_IRQ_DESC:0 "Atban was the one time rival and now successor to the famous soldier and Sheikh Auda abu Tayi. When Auda's ambitons failed, he retreated from Aqab into the Al Nefud. The Howietat's livestock starved, wells were denied to them. In desperation Atban ibn Jazi choose to again put aside his rivalry for the sake of thier people and seek aid from the Rashids. This bid was sucessful, and Atban became the representative of the Howietat. Auda's and his reputations for joining the Arab Revolt and facing the harshest of the turkish reprisals made Atban a surprisingly good candidate for Emir. Atban challenged the Emirs to live among their own, and was rewarded with cooperation."
POLITICS_SABAH_IRQ_DESC:0 "The Emirs of Kuwait began the century by setting the Rashid Saud conflict in motion, and it has finally paid off for them with the ascension of Jabe Al Sabah. It was Jaber's father who gave the Sauds arms and men in 1906 to retake Riyadh, a decision that would come back to haunt his son. The Ikhwan, Ibn Sauds frenzied soldiers attacked Kuwait when the British left, leaving devestation along thw 1st Ring Road. Al Sabah prostrated himself to the Rashids, who forgave him and announced their protection of Kuwait. Now the Sabah are owed favors from the Rashids accrued during wartime, who exchanged this debt for a promise to elect Jaber al Sabah. Jaber himself reminding the emirs that he was first into battle on his horse against the Sauds, and that he alone could lead the charge against the Ottomans."
POLITICS_SYNDIE_JBS_DESC:0 "A brother to Abdulaziz bin Saud bin Abdulaziz, Mishaal did not follow his family path. His interests came not from the numerous clans that paraded through Hail, but from the ordinary citizens of Shammar. It was under his mothers instruction that Mishaal came to see the Rashid Emir and all emirates as haughty and aloof. This pushed Mishaal into seeking examples of leaders connected to their people. He found inspiration in Muhammad al Ashmar, whose provockative ideas about islamic law. Mishaal came to believe that Islamic Law tended towards socialism, so he made that clear to his family. Mishaal's exile ended when the Internationale entered Arabia, and people remarked that he was the only among the Emirs to express concern for the common peopele. In this strange way, Mishaal vindicated his familys name."

POLITICS_MICHAEL_COLLINS_DESC:0 "Michael Collins is the saviour and national hero of Ireland, with a combination of popularity and rigged elections keeping him in power. Born in Cork, Collins fought in the 1916 Easter Rising and afterwards became the president of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. During the war he organised the IRA into an effective guerrilla force, seeking to avoid the mistakes of 1916. In 1921 he was sent to negotiate the Anglo-Irish Treaty. Although by threatening to continue the war with German backing he was able to acquire all thirty-two counties in the treaty, he was unable to secure a republic, with the British fearing that an independent Irish republic would immediately become a German base. When he was expelled from Sinn Féin by Éamon de Valera he managed to form his own party, Fine Gael, which quickly overtook Sinn Féin in popularity. After the British Revolution he declared an independent Republic of Ireland and defeated a Unionist uprising in Ulster. Now with the Second Weltkrieg approaching Collins advocates revitalising Ireland's economy and military in order to assert Ireland's independence."
POLITICS_CATHAL_BRUGHA_DESC:0 "Born Charles William St. John Burgess of mixed Catholic and Protestant heritage, and later changing his name after joining the Gaelic League, Cathal Brugha is a war hero from the Easter Rising and leader of the rump Sinn Féin following the Anglo-Irish Treaty. He, already being a staunch rival of Collins during the War of Independence, became leader of the democratic opposition, a coalition of democratic parties opposing Collins, although he has increasingly become a figurehead to rally around in his old age as a new generation rises in the Republican movement. He and his party, bolstered in strength by many ex-Labourites following the 1923 ban after Larkin's failed uprising, advocate a social democratic Ireland as per the Democratic Programme of 1919, and a pro-German alignment to oppose Ireland's enemies in Britain and Canada."

Afterwards, he emigrated to America only to return to Ireland after the American economic collapse, and joined the anglophile National Centre Party, eventually becoming its leader due to his great oratory skills. A presistent critic of both the Collins' government and the democratic opposition's sympathies towards isolationism or Germanophilia, he is a strong advocate of a pro-Entente policy and rapproachment with the Unionist community."
POLITICS_JIM_LARKIN_DESC:0 "James Larkin, born in England before moving with his family to Ireland grew up in poverty and became a trade union organiser and formed the Labour Party with James Connolly, most famously participating in the failed Dublin Lockout of 1913. After the failure of the lockout, he moved to America and became a member of the Socialist Party of America. Upon his return to Ireland in 1923 he received a hero's welcome from Irish syndicalists and took control of the Labour Party, hoping to launch a syndicalist rising as in France over disappointments with the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The rising was a failure with informers revealing the plans of the ICA rebels beforehand and the Labour Party was banned, leading Larkin to go into hiding with the help of the Commune of France. The Irish Citizen Army suffered dear for their loyalty, with their role in the Easter Rising being erased from the official history and their founder James Connolly's role downplayed."

As Minister for Justice, he passed laws repressing syndicalism as well as anti-traveller settlement laws against the Pavee community, as well as using his influence to encourage the Irish language. He also maintained links with the Romanian Iron Guard, expressing sympathy for establishing a similar regime in Ireland. To this end, he formed his own party Ailtirí na hAiséirghe that would revive the Irish language, ban the English language after a period of five years, and establish strong anti-syndicalist and anti-Semitic policies."

Lemass is an advocate for industrialisation and while he is a believer in capitalism, he also believes that normalising relations with the Union of Britain could have a beneficial effect on Irish trade and the economy. He is in favour of a flexible Irish foreign policy depending on the nation's needs, contrasting the CPNH from the other democratic parties who have their own biases in regards to Irish foreign policy."

The young Emir's crowning at age ten a machination of the Al Sabhan family, his maternal family. He witnessed as a young man the death of famous British Explorer William Shakespear without ever realizing the humor in his name, or that his death would leave the Rashids with no allies during the Weltkrieg. Despite squabbling, the loss of the Rashid army to British maxim guns and a betrayal by his cousin, the Rashid family survived. A head on his shoulders allowed him to secure a protection deal with the Emir of Kuwait, the leader of the Howietat, and an unsteady peace with Nejd. Now this Emir is grown and ready to lead Arabia through the violence and betrayal towards a brighter future."

After many divisions of the Ottoman 4th Army were discharged in 1921, Sidqi managed the welfare of both Arab and Kurd troops in Kirkuk. Sidqi cultivated a loyalty in his men towards him above official orders, which i=only increased when military pensions were cut in 1922. When the Assyrian rebelled in 1925, Bakr personally led his troops through towns killing soldiers and civilians alike. It was this ruthless efficiency and the recent desertion of the Hamidiye that gave Bakr an informal rule as military governor of the Mosul Vilyet. Bakr's aim is to subordinate the kurdish tribes under his military clique with the help of Arab and Turkish soldiers."
POLITICS_BARZANJI_DESC:0 "Sheikh Mahmud Barzanji is the leader and patriarch of the Barzanji clan living to the north of Mosul. Although Mahmud himself is Sunni, his ancestor Musa Kazem of the Twelver Shia gives him authority over Kurds in Ardelan. Mahmud has spent the last decade gathering arms and supporters from Iranian Kurdistan for revolt. This revolt is planned the same way prior Kurdish revolts have, and the incredible success has bolstered Kurdish claims that their dynasty is as legitimate as the Qajars or Osman."
POLITICS_BABA_SHEIKH_DESC:0 "Nominally a citizen of Iran, Haji Bana Sheikh was a religious leader for the Mahabad province of Persia before the Weltkrieg. His position as a Sheikh only recognised by the kurds in Mahabad, in which he was considered a moderate Shia leader. When the Russians entered Kurdistan, he formed the Alliance of Islam Committee to seek cooperation with Iran and Azerbaijan. Haji cultivated an ally in General Reza Khan, which has finally paid dividends in Persia's triumph. Haji collaborated with the exiled Mustafa Barzanji in 1932 to establish the PDK, although they soon clashed over whether the party would support Iran's claims or not. Haji's pro Iran position and Reza's support led to a breakdown of this coalition in 1935, though both leaders stay in touch."
POLITICS_MIHEMED_DESC:0 "It was only after the fall of the Soviet Union that Qazi Mihemed had realised his calling was socialism. Born into a rare Kurdish aristocracy and destined to be a poet, Qazi published his poems in Kurdi and Farsi, drawing the ire of the Qajars. His poems never reached the West, as the Khoyboun refused to publish his work. When internationalism finally came to Kurdistan, his works were found in the hands of socialists and he was found and uplifted from a jail in Sanandaj to realise the Kurdish destiny. Unlike most Levantine socialists, he rallies the Kurds in a united faith in Allah instead of nationality."
POLITICS_MUSTAFA_BARZANI_DESC:0 "A relative of the Sheikh Mehmûd Barzanji, Mustafa was only five when his famaily was imprisoned by the Ottoman military. Spending the majority of the Weltkrieg in hiding with his remaining family, Mustafa first became involved in his brother Ahmad's milita in the 1920's. Ahmad's milita attempted to steal arms from the Ottoman 4th Army in 1925, leading to Ahmad's capture and execution. Mustafa fled with the remainder to Azerbaijan, where he joined Haji in establishing the PDK. Mustafa was disturbed to find the Haji had allies in the Persian military, and lobbied for the party to turn away from secularism and cooperation with Iran towards total autonomy and Barzanji tribal laws. Officially Mustafa and his allies are the leaders of the PDK."
POLITICS_SHEIKH_SAID_DESC:0 "Follwoing the end of the Ottoman Caliphate during the War in the Sands, many Kurds formerly belonging to the Hamidiye were discharged without pay. Those soldiers returned to find the Sidqi clique had slandered them as traitors. The Hamidiye moved into the Turkish side of Kurdistan, among the Zaza Kurds and Alevi. Among them was the Azadi Sheikh Said, an adept soldier who felt that the Ottomans were betrayed by secularists. His anti secular position may have alienated the Iranian and Iraqi Kurds, but the Zazas rallied around him. Said reorganised the Hamidiye along with even Turkish volunteers into a fighting force to restore the Caliphate. Said himself was a Naqshbandi Sufi, who felt that Egypt had abandoned the path, and Salfis posed a threat to Sufi existence."
POLITICS_RIZA_DERSHIMI_DESC:0 "Karuman is a member of what had been a Ottoman loyalist family. The Bedirxans had ruled Bohtan for a century leading up to their independence activities. Compared to many other Kurdish nationalists, Kamuran had traveled to Britain prior to their revolution to establish a support group for Kurdish immigrants. His experience in Turkish law allowed him to arrange for people to leave Kurdistan for Britain until 1924. Following the revolution, Kamuran worked in the Commune of France developing new alphabet based on French to enable Kurds to spread their message internationally. This work was allowed despite his dealings with the former empires, until 1929 when his residency was revoked. This turned him against socialism, and his publications made out of Turkey reflected this. He is brought in as a competent economist and intellectual President of Kurdistan, in order to give dignity to the post."

POLITICS_AHMED_SHARIF_DESC:0 "The third-generation ruler of the Senussi Oder of Triploitania, Ahmed Sharif inherited a precarious role from his father, Muhammad Idris. Compliance with the Ottoman Caliphate was never fully embraced by the many sufis in Tripoltania. The Weltkrieg broke the Senussi solidarity, and Ahmed Sharif fell out of favor to his cousin Idris, who was declared Al Mahdi as Senussi during the crisis. Thanks to an army raised by Ottoman General Nuri Killigil, Ahmed Sharif was able to oust Idris and force him into exile in Egypt. Italy's disssoltiuon provided the prextext to invade Fezzan, and thus Ahmed Sharif became the first King of Tripolitania under Ottoman protection. A newfound hostility has found Ahmed adrift from his former allies in Al Ahzar university in Cairo, with his subordinates slowly being replaced by Turkish yes men and foreign trained intellectuals."

Sharif came to regret this in 1911 when the Italians came to Cyrenica. A pragmatist and a pacifist, Sharif yielded to the Italians. His ward Omar insitagted the people of Bayda into resistance against the Italians and Sharif. Omar's loyalists left Sharif to tend to the casualties of war, these victims would later remember Sharif's dedication to survival, and elected him leader of the Republic. Sharif has renewed his dedication to the Libyan people, and lamented that Omar could have been a greater leader if he cooperated with the wider world."

Maziq's family submitted to the Senussi order when Idris reclaimed the land from the Italians, and were put in touch with the legendary commander Omar Mukhtar. Maziq covertly supported Idris in exile, and simultaniously educated himself in Italian and French to work with industrialists. When the Second Weltkrieg came to Tripolitania, his organisation helped people evacuate to Algiers. Now this reputation has become known, and the grateful people of Libya have elected him President."
POLITICS_ABU_MENIAR_DESC:0 "Among the Qadhadhfa, very few would have expected an illiterate bedouin to rise in the alien ideology of socialism. But when the Italians were occupying Qasr Abu Hadi, the illiterate Abu Meniar bought schoolbooks in Italian. His journey towards literacy in Italian continued after their army retreated, and his fascination witn changes happening in Europe led him to move his family to Tripoli in 1923. Tripoli being the center for Italian expats, Abu Meniar began reading Il Popolo d'Italia. Mussolinis strive for the unity of Italian people to overcome poverty led Meinar to ingratiate himself with the right people. Upon the rightful succession of the Internationale, Abu Meinar became their most trusted associate."

He was one of the first volunteers in the Lithuanian army in 1918, and soon worked his way to Major General, but he was quick to realise that there will be no free and independent Lithuania under the German thumb. Škirpa and a number of minor disgruntled officers formed the Iron Wolf Organisation, a National Populist paramilitary fighting against German rule and the Slavic minorities within the Kingdom, as well as the Party of Lithuanian Interests as the movement's political arm. And now, he is in charge, under the Lithuanian equivalent title of the Romanian Conducator or Russian Vozhd - Tautos Vadas."

Even though he bears the name of the first king of Lithuania, it's unifier and folk hero, Mindaugas III is not concerned with the people he reigns over at all - they are foreigners to him. And Karl Gero is as much of a foreigner to them. It's hard to say if Mindaugas III would survive even a day on the throne without the Kaiser backing him from the shadows."
POLITICS_KAZIMIERAS_II_DESC:0 "A Polish-Lithuanian aristocrat from Kretinga, Kazimieras Viktoras Tiškevičius, now Kazimieras II, has committed the greatest sin possible in the eyes of the common Lithuanian - selling out to the Russians and giving up his nation's sovereignity to return the country under the hated eastern tyrant. This event has tainted his image to his people forever, and even though Tiškevičius is a capable administrator, a bright mind and even feels some compassion for the people he rules, his rule over Lithuania is tenuous at best."

A committed nationalist, he advocated the national self-determination of Lithuania in Saint Petersburg; with the establishment of the German led Lithuanian puppet government following the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Voldemaras returned to his homeland to again fight for its independence. As head of state, Voldemaras is likely to pursue an ultra-nationalist agenda which promotes the superiority of the Lithuanian people and devotion to the state."

His first political move was to write an article critizing Leguía's government in that same year, for which he was arrested, triggering the first ever student protest in the history of Perú, which demanded Agüero's release. Agüero was released, where he became a teacher in San Marcos, but when Leguia took over the government in 1919, Agüero wrote a manifesto defending the constitutional order and left in a self-imposed exile towards Europe.\n\n That travel to Europe changed him, as he was forced to witness the European recovery from the Weltkrieg, as well as the Syndicalist uprisings. It's in these circumstances that he meets D'Annunzio and Italo Balbo, whose far-right philosophy began influencing the once liberal Agüero. He returns in 1927 to Peru, after Cerro deposed Leguia, and began working as a history professor at the 'Pontificia Universidad Catolica'. He at first saw in Cerro just another dictator, but a meeting he had with the Caudillo changed his mind, as his experience in Europe and relation with thinkers like D'Annunzio and Carlés quickly turned him into a friend and close advisor of Sanchez Cerro. Although the hispanist ideals Agüero had were too extreme for Cerro, he was named head of ministers.

He signed up for 'Facultad de Letras de la Universidad de Trujillo' when he finished high-school, but would later decide to study to become a Lawyer in the 'Universidad Mayor de San Marcos' in Lima. There he met Manuel Gonzalez Prada, whose anarchist thoughts influenced the young Raul. He joined several protests against the Leguia regime, which would decide to get rid of him by granting him a scholarship to France. However, this move would backfire on Leguia, as the revolutions in Europe would influence young Raul and his friend, Mariategui, towards Syndicalist ideals.\n\n He would go to Mexico in 1924, and with other Peruvian syndicalist exiles formed the 'Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana' or 'APRA'. The APRA would focus on pan-americanism (or as Raul liked to call it, 'Indo-Americanism') and fighting imperialism and the burgois oligarchy that had settled in the continent. He'd return to Perú in 1925, settling in the north of the country with his fellow Apristas. In 1929, Raul led the Trujillo takeover, when APRA forces took over the city and proclaimed a Trujillan commune that would be lead by Raul, and executing the local garrison. When the revolt was crushed, he managed to escape to Chile, where he'd join forces with Churata and González Prada in order to strengthen the APRA for a new revolution in 1931.\n\n Now that Raul Haya de la Torre leads Perú, he'll bring about his dream of a worker's utopia for Perú, whatever the cost may be."
POLITICS_CHURATA_DESC:0 "Gamaliel Churata, whose real name is Arturo Pablo Peralta Miranda, was born in 1897 in Puno, Perú. Churata formed several culturalist groups in his youth, through which he met Manuel González Prada, Raul Haya de la Torre, and most importantly, José Carlos Mariategui, who would become a close friend of Churata. He was exiled to Bolivia in 1917, but would return to Perú in 1925, joining up Mariategui in Moquegua as the first group of left-wing indigenist thinkers was formed. When Mariategui finally died in 1930 in Chile, Churata was appointed by his friend in his dying wishes as the leader of the 'Frente Tupacamarista'. In his new role as leader, he'd later gather in 1931 with Raul Haya de la Torre and Alfredo González Prada in order to form a United Front from which bring about the Peruvian revolution. Now that Churata leads Perú, he'll focus on restoring the Andinean cultural identity and purge the Spanish-descendant burgoisie from the government, bringing about a new culture and society for the now new country of Piruw."

In 1919, Prada would become the intellectual leader of the newly formed 'Frente Armado Obrero', which would fight for better working rights in its most moderate form and for an outright revolution in it's more radical members. Seeing the violence this group generated in Lima, Leguia decided to send the military to supress the movement, ending the first Peruvian Syndicalist experiment. He then decided to retire from public life temporarily, gathering with other anarchists in Peru until the failed Trujillo rebellion forced him to go to Chile. There he joined forces in 1931 with Raúl Haya de la Torre and Gamaliel Churata with the goal of bringing the revolution to Perú.

He staunchly opposed the government of Augusto B. Leguía, for Flores would be imprisoned. He was freed after a decree by Sanchez Cerro, quickly gaining Flores's loyalty, who joined the Union Revolucionaria soon after. He accompanied Sanchez Cerro in his tour through Arequipa, Puno, Cusco and Ica, and would later become deputy for the UR. After the resign of Francisco Lanatta, Flores becomes the president of the council of ministers. During his time as president of the council, the crews of the Peruvian navy ships 'Almirante Grau' and 'Coronel Bolognesi' mutinied with apparent APRA influence. While Flores didn't believe the crews deserved the death penalty, the martial court determined they were traitors and had to die, so he came to the island of San Lorenzo with the prisoners, where he'd lead the execution personally. It is said that Flores himself forced each sailor to dig his own grave before being shot, earning him a reputation for cruelty in the UR.\n\n Flores became a close follower of Agüero, although he considered the latter to be too conservative in his approach against the APRA. Now that Flores is in power, he'll bring about his vision for a corporatist and totalitarian Perú, free from the influence of the decadent APRA which he'll hunt down relentlessly. However, his rejection of all races outside of the Spanish-descendant Criollos is bound to shine through in his policies, and might upset the local native and Asian population..."

However, just two years before Gustaf's ascension to the throne, in 1905 his father had been forced to accept a government chosen by the majority in Parliament.\n\nWhen Gustaf first took the throne in 1907 he also ended a Swedish tradition of roughly 700 years when he refused a coronation. As such, during his reign as a king, he never wore a crown. While at first ambivalent about the Swedish politicians he angered in February 1914, when the Swedish liberal government wanted to cut in military spending. After holding a speech condemning their actions, the liberal government stepped down and was replaced by civil servants appointed by Gustav himself. In the following 1917 elections the Liberals and Social democrats made heavy gains, but Gustaf still attempted installing a conservative government. However, they were unable to form a coalition and Gustaf realised he could no longer appoint governments of his own choosing. During the following reforms, he found himself forced to act upon his minister's advice, and not the other way around.\n\nHe is married to the sickly Queen Victoria of Baden, who is known to be wearing the pants in the Royal household, especially concerning the King's attempted influence in politics in general and the close relations to Germany in particular."
