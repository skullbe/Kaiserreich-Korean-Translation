### Black Monday General Events ###
black.1.t:0 "This is not meant to be here!"
black.1.d:0 "If you see this please report on the paradox forums!"
black.1.a:0 "I'm serious REPORT IT!"
black.2.t:0 "Black Monday"
black.2.d:0 "On the third of February 1936, the Berlin Stock Exchange stopped sinking - it plunged. Fuelled by the instability of the market panic, selling erupted as soon as the stock market opened on Monday morning. \n\nIt took well into the night for the teleprinters to stop sputtering out the results of what became known as Black Monday. When the results had been analysed, it was clear that the situation had only got worse.\n\nThe shock of this unprecedented economic catastrophe will, no doubt, be felt over the entire world. The German golden age has ended - for now, at least..."

black.4.d:0 "German citizens, panicked by the collapse of the Berlin Stock Market, are rushing to make bank runs to withdraw their assets.

black.4.a:0 "Close the banks temporarily."
black.4.b:0 "Guarantee the holdings of private individuals."
black.4.c:0 "Do nothing."
black.5.t:0 "Black Week comes to an end"
black.5.d:0 "The situation hardly improved in the days following Black Monday, which was the start of what became known as Black Week. Panic-selling of stocks reached an all-time high as people tried to dump their stocks before they became worthless. When the Berlin Stock Market closed at the end of the week, the market was as dead as the 11 major economic experts and top executives in Germany had committed suicide. The German government had to act."
black.5.a:0 "We must reform the economy."
black.6.t:0 "Six months after Black Monday"

black.20.t:0 "War Stimulates the Economy"
black.20.d:0 "Due to the war, industrial production across several sectors has skyrocketed and the workforce has endeavoured to fulfil their patriotic duty. This has had a net positive effect on the economy by reducing the aftermath of the Black Monday crash. It seems the economy is finally showing signs of life!"
black.20.a:0 "Excellent."
black.21.t:0 "Financial Troubles in the Colonies"
black.21.d:0 "Rising inflation and a consequently debased Reichsmark means that state expenses on German colonies had become too great to maintain pre-Black Monday tax codes. Some maverick politicians propose raising taxes, but raising taxes – on German nationals just to aid German colonials – would obviously not be popular, especially not under the present economic situation. Most of the Reichstag merely proposes limited financial support for our colonial possessions. What shall we do?"
black.21.a:0 "Raise taxes to appease the needs of the colonies."
black.21.b:0 "Spare expenses only for the colonies under our direct control."
black.21.c:0 "Tighten our belts. They'll have to find other sources of income."
black.22.t:0 "Major Bank Declares Bankruptcy"
black.22.d:0 "Today, because of the state of our economy a major bank has unfortunately declared bankruptcy today. Should we help the account holders or avoid any intervention?"

black.23.t:0 "Major Industrial Corporation Declares Bankruptcy"
black.23.d:0 "Today, because of the state of our economy a major industrial corporation has unfortunately declared bankruptcy today. Several factories are going to close all over the country."

black.50.t:0 "The Kaiserreich Economic Policy"
black.50.d:0 "Finally, three years after Black Monday, our economy is slowly recovering! This can be the time to invest more to further secure our national interests!"
black.50.a:0 "Invest in our Heimat!"
black.50.b:0 "Invest in our colonies!"
black.50.c:0 "Invest in our sphere of influence!"
black.50.e:0 "Announce a new economic cooperation plan with our neighbours!"

### Austria and Black Monday ###
black.200.t:0 "Black Monday hits Austria"
black.200.d:0 "Black Monday has hit Germany and it would not be long before its shock-wave rippled across Europe. Given it's close proximity, Austria was among the first to affected. The economy is struggling and troubling times lie ahead."
black.200.a:0 "Ach, Gott!"
