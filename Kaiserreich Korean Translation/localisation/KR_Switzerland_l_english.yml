SWI_combat_economic_crisis_desc:0 "This Referendum, presented to the Swiss people, details plans for the government to introduce sweeping austerity measures to combat the economic crisis caused by the recent collapse of the Berlin Stock Exchange."
SWI_transport_of_goods_desc:0 "This Referendum, presented to the Swiss people, details plans for the revision of a law that would standardise the transportation of goods and animals on public roads, and would limit this transportation in favour of governmental transport."
SWI_army_reorganization_desc:0 "This Referendum, presented to the Swiss people, details plans for the reorganisation of the army along the German model. Such a reorganisation would necessitate the invitation of German military advisers and result in temporary disorganisation in the military."
SWI_freemasonry_desc:0 "This Referendum, presented to the Swiss people, details plans for the banning of secret societies such as Freemasonry and other secret politicised gatherings."
SWI_revise_constitution_desc:0 "This Referendum, presented to the Swiss people, details plans to revise the Federal Constitution and grant greater powers to the ruling party so as to combat subversive threats in the nation, such as the threats posed by extremist movements in the Romandy region."
SWI_syndicalist_unions_desc:0 "This Referendum, presented to the Swiss people, details plans to ban the formation of or participation in Unions of other political organisations that follow the Syndicalist manifesto or adhere to strong Syndicalist beliefs. This measure is designed to curb extremist influence in Switzerland and restore stability in the nation."
SWI_language_acts_desc:0 "This Referendum, presented to the Swiss people, details plans to include Romansch as an official language in Switzerland. Including Romansch as an official language would serve to include those who have previously felt as outcasts into the national government."
SWI_romandy_crisis_desc:0 "Agitated by supporters in the neighbouring French Commune, local Syndicalist revolutionaries in Romandy have made a move against the Swiss national government. This uprising has become internationally known as "The Romandy Crisis", and how the government reacts to this crisis will shape the future of the Swiss people."
SWI_bend_to_france_desc:0 "Germany has abandoned us, and no other nation has taken up our cause in the face of the French behemoth. Is it not better, then, to join the French rather than be crushed by the Syndicalist tide?"
SWI_enemies_on_all_sides_desc:0 "Germany to the North has betrayed us. France to the West has seized our land. Italy to the South has remained silent. Austria to the East pays us no heed. We are surrounded by enemies and traitors on all sides. The Swiss people have no friends but themselves, and none other."
SWI_german_aid_desc:0 "In the face of outright aggression from the French, Germany has answered our calls for aid and stands firmly with the Swiss people in their stand against Syndicalism. With Germany by our side, we can beat back the French hordes and secure our borders with German aid."
SWI_italian_assisstance_desc:0 "Heeding our call for aid, Italy has stood tall amongst the powers of Europe and declared their support for Switzerland in the Romandy Crisis. With Italy as our powerful ally, we stand a chance against the French."
SWI_black_spot_of_europe_desc:0 "There is a Black Spot forming in the centre of Europe, where none enter, and none leave. The Swiss people have made their nation an impenetrable fortress and turned all others away, content to their self-imposed isolation."
SWI_defend_the_borders_desc:0 "Our borders are in danger of being violated. It is our duty to remind our neighbours that we are a sovereign nation that will not be trampled upon again by an imperialist foreign power."
SWI_referendum_syndicalism_desc:0 "This Referendum, presented to the Swiss people, details plans to abolish the current Federal Government and reconstitute a new government to be decided upon by the Swiss people, and approved by invited guests from the neighbouring French Commune."
SWI_german_economic_assisstance_desc:0 "Switzerland is not a nation gifted with an abundance of natural resources. Creating a flow of men and materiel from Mitteleuropa to Switzerland will allow us to sustain our fragile economy in the face of French aggression."
SWI_joint_command_desc:0 "Our military command is enthusiastic but green in the field. We must reorganise our command structure to integrate our own forces with the massive German military. This joint command will increase the effectiveness of both nation's armies in the unforgiving Swiss Alps."
SWI_ban_all_foreigners_desc:0 "It is through the corruption of foreign influences that we have found ourselves in this political hole, surrounded on all sides by those who want to seize our lands and destroy our culture. They must be expelled if our nation is to survive."
SWI_abolish_the_verdingkinder_desc:0 "The Verdingkinder, or "Contract Children", are children taken from their loving families and sent to work as slaves for the benefit of fat capitalist corporations. These children must be freed immediately from the capitalist yoke and be re-educated with good Syndicalist values."
SWI_mandatory_service_desc:0 "It is not enough to simply draft the men in defence of Switzerland. The women, the children, the elderly. Our neighbours can field armies of millions, so we too must field an army of equal size to combat these threats."
SWI_gold_reserves_desc:0 "To form the backbone of our new economy, the Swiss Bank's gold reserves must be filled and preserved with large quantities of gold that will anchor our currency for generations to come."
SWI_the_government_has_failed_desc:0 "The current model of the Swiss government has proven wholly weak and ineffective in protecting Switzerland from the vultures that circle her. Drastic governmental reform and a strong leading hand are needed if Switzerland is to continue as a free and independent nation."
SWI_one_people_desc:0 "For too long have the Swiss people bent to the wills of our neighbours and spoken in their tongues. It is time for Switzerland to abandon these foreign languages and only conduct official business in the Romansch language."
SWI_swiss_french_alliance_desc:0 "The diplomatic pressure coming from the French Commune is overwhelming, and the other powers of Europe have shown themselves too afraid to stand against the Commune's might. The Syndicalist wave is unstoppable, we are better off bowing to France of our own accord then being swept aside by the inevitable."
SWI_geneva_avenged_desc:0 "Years ago, the brave workers of Geneva stood up for their rights and freedoms, and were brutally struck down by the old capitalist regime. Now we can properly honour those heroes who gave their lives to lay the foundations for the modern Syndicalist Switzerland we know and love today."
SWI_national_defense_desc:0 "The national spirit of Switzerland focuses on a strong defence in the face of foreign invasion. The Swiss people do not fight for imperialist ambitions, but to defend their neighbours and their homes."
SWI_beat_back_french_desc:0 "After securing our position from the National Redoubt, it is time to gather our forces and mount a large counterattack in order to fight the French off of our land. Once beaten back, we can work with our German allies and march into the Commune itself."
SWI_austrian_assisstance_desc:0 "Responding to our calls for aid, our longtime neighbour the Austrian Empire has responded and promised to defend our sovereignty against French aggression. With the aid of a power such as Austria, we are surely capable of holding against the French invaders."
SWI_swiss_miracle_desc:0 "A combination of strong economic policies, a healthy bank stocked with gold, and a dash of luck have combined to birth an economic boom the likes of which Switzerland has never seen. Dubbed "The Swiss Miracle", this spurt of economic growth is exactly what we need to advance our place in the world's hierarchy."
SWI_fortress_desc:0 "Switzerland's defensive mindset centres around a series of mountain fortresses and fortifications that make Switzerland an impenetrable obstacle. This prideful spirit of defence drives our forces onwards to a glorious victory."
SWI_new_government_desc:0 "Over 600 years ago our ancestors gathered on the Rütli to swear the oath of the Swiss Confederacy. Now, on the eve of our rebirth, we must gather representatives from the Unions across Switzerland to swear a new oath, one forming the foundation of the new Syndicalist age."
SWI_national_unions_desc:0 "Outside of Romandy, Syndicalist Unions have failed to make significant gains politically and are struggling with their newfound power. We must support and officially recognise the authority these Unions now have in the government."
SWI_gotthard_desc:0 "Fortress St. Gotthard forms one of the three main defensive fortifications that make up the defensive network stretching across Switzerland. While strong, this network is still in need of improvements and repairs. Updating these fortresses is a key step in maintaining a strong defensive stance."
SWI_maurice_desc:0 "Fortress St. Maurice forms one of the three main defensive fortifications that make up the defensive network stretching across Switzerland. While strong, this network is still in need of improvements and repairs. Updating these fortresses is a key step in maintaining a strong defensive stance."
SWI_Sargans_desc:0 "Fortress Sargans forms one of the three main defensive fortifications that make up the defensive network stretching across Switzerland. While strong, this network is still in need of improvements and repairs. Updating these fortresses is a key step in maintaining a strong defensive stance."
SWI_retreat_redoubt_desc:0 "The betrayal of the Romandy Cantons and the advance of the French forces has put us in an unfavourable position. We cannot hope to hold the line at the border, it is best that our military retreat to our prepared defences in the National Redoubt as we regroup and prepare our counterattack."
SWI_cultivation_battle_desc:0 "Switzerland is not a nation blessed with an abundance of natural resources. For centuries Swiss farmers have fought a battle against the harsh mountain climates to grow enough crops to feed the nation. Now that war looms on the horizon, we must subsidise these farmers to make Switzerland self-sufficient."
SWI_bircher_plan_desc:0 "Colonel Eugen Bircher has put forth a plan to defend the nation that involves pursuing a more traditional war with a larger army and a central, mobile force that would seek set-piece battles. Choosing this plan would commit the nation to fighting a war centred around a mobile army with as many offensive moves as defensive."
SWI_guisan_plan_desc:0 "Colonel Henri Guisan has put forth a plan to defend the nation that involves a stoic defence and continued usage of the pre-prepared fallback lines and fortresses that would ensure a campaign of guerrilla warfare throughout our nation. Accepting his plan would mean moving forward with a plan to fight a purely defensive war."
SWI_man_borders_desc:0 "We must first activate the civilian Border Guard units and flood our outer defences with soldiers in a show of force against outside aggression. The Swiss people will flock in droves to our defence, and only the staunchest of foes would dare break themselves upon our walls."
SWI_guisan_speech_desc:0 "What the troops need to perform effectively is a strong leader who will lead them through the darkness to victory. Henri Guisan is prepared to be that man, and has gathered a large amount of soldiers to inspire with his words."
SWI_bullet_or_bayonet_desc:0 "If Switzerland is to fall to foreign aggressors, she will not go down without a fight. By bullet or by bayonet the Swiss people will fight for every inch of land and throw our enemies back from our lands."
SWI_resist_to_the_end_desc:0 "Even after the battles are lost and are armies driven from the field, our enemies can not rest easy. It is the duty of the Swiss people to resist in everything they do, and to stop the enemy in every way they can."
SWI_ski_divisions_desc:0 "The Swiss Ski Divisions have a mastery of the Alpine terrain and should be moved into a single, cohesive unit capable of making a decisive strike against our enemies. Properly equipping and expanding these forces will give us a powerful tool to use in the fights to come."
SWI_mountineer_defense_desc:0 "The best defence is a good offence. It is not good enough to simply sit behind or lines. We must make active manoeuvres and strike at the enemy whenever we are given an opportunity, so that we may eventually drive him from our lands entirely."
SWI_luftwaffe_desc:0 "The Swiss Air Force has not seen a major change in composition since the end of the Weltkrieg. Our planes are old and decrepit, and in drastic need of an overhaul. We must begin an immediate modernization of our air force so as not to be left behind."
SWI_mitteleuropa_desc:0 "Our continued fight side-by-side with the Germans and integration of our economic and military command structures have pushed us ever closer into the German sphere. Our ties are so great that it seems almost impossible to sever our ties with Germany even if we desired it. We are already a de facto member of the German sphere, and so should formally join Mitteleuropa as a proper member state."
SWI_national_bank_desc:0 "The Swiss National Bank is the strong economic arm of the entire country, handling the finances of the vast majority of the population and the government alike. Subsidising and assisting the bank in its operations, and allowing for bank secrecy when dealing with accountholder funds, will serve to boost the economy as we recover from the Black Monday disaster."
SWI_free_our_skies_desc:0 "Our terrestrial defences are strong, but can be easily weakened in the face of enemy air superiority. We should focus heavily on maintaining air superiority in order to keep our enemies at bay."
SWI_swiss_guard_desc:0 "Long since a fixture of the Holy See, our newfound relationship with the Italy has given us opportunity to expand the Papal Guard with experienced and veteran soldiers. Sending these soldiers to the Pope's aid will serve as a fine gesture of goodwill and thanks for standing by us in our time of need."
SWI_alpine_rhine_desc:0 "Our border with Austria is complicated by rivers and mountains that make traversing the terrain slow and difficult. Expansion of these passages between our two nations will enhance the Austrian's ability to send troops and materials to our aid when advancing westwards into the Commune."
SWI_economic_routes_desc:0 "The conflict with France has severed many of our traditional routes of supply. As a landlocked nation, we rely heavily on land routes through friendly nations in order to receive the resources we need for survival. We must expand these network in order to fuel our war effort and maintain the flow of goods."
SWI_new_fighters_desc:0 "It is not enough to copy the designs of other nation's militaries. Funding a new initiative to design a truly Swiss fighter will reduce our dependence on foreign militaries for supplies and equipment."
SWI_international_aid_desc:0 "Our own forces are insufficient, but we hold the moral high ground in this obviously unwarranted conflict. By pleading with every nation that will listen for aid, maybe we can scrape together enough assistance to turn the tide."
SWI_formalize_volunteers_desc:0 "With a new flow of foreign volunteers established, it is now only a matter of organising this trickle of able-bodied men into cohesive fighting units. Mixing these volunteer units with proper Swiss soldiers will strengthen their backbone and improve their organisation the battlefield."
SWI_hold_the_line_desc:0 "Even without a world power on our side, we must still find a way to hold the line against the French aggressors. We cannot win alone, so we must use every advantage available to us to survive long enough for foreign intervention to save the day."
SWI_german_military_tactics_desc:0 "Joining our military command with Germany's has taught us that our own military tactics are woefully behind the times. The new doctrine of the German Army can be taught to our troops in order to bring our troops up to our Ally's standards."
SWI_mountain_airfields_desc:0 "The lofty peaks of the Swiss Alps provide many areas for us to construct new airfields for military use. The altitude of these airfields will make them difficult for the enemy to seize or destroy in war."
SWI_air_academy_desc:0 "Our air force is lacking in trained pilots and serviceable planes. In light of this crisis, we must take advantage of every possible plane we can get our hands on. One proposition is to nationalise all civilian planes and recruit their pilots, mechanics, and radiomen into our own air force."
SWI_cross_the_border_desc:0 "We should look to use our air force not only as a defensive force, but also as a force capable of striking deep into enemy territory. Performing these cross-border raids into enemy territory will let our enemies know that we are capable of more than simple defensive actions."
SWI_mountain_aa_desc:0 "The mountainous terrain of the Alps creates a multitude of areas where we can create new defensive AA emplacements to defend our skies. Such a network of emplaced defences will make any air force rethink their plans to invade our airspace."
SWI_new_swiss_army_desc:0 "Through reform and new military leadership, the Swiss Army of today is all but unrecognisable compared to the army that marched in drill but a few short years ago. This new army is tough, veteran, and ready to take on the world."
SWI_coal_mines_desc:0 "The National Coal Mines provide the strong economic foundation on which the Swiss economy is built. Expanding their operations will increase our economic output exponentially."
SWI_reverse_economic_downturn_desc:0 "After the disastrous hit to our economy that was Black Monday, it has become clear the government needs to take immediate action in order to save the Swiss economy from suffering a complete meltdown."
SWI_war_profiteering_desc:0 "Our neighbour's losses are our gains. Selling weapons to our neighbours as they kill each other in senseless conflict can only serve to strengthen our own position when the time comes to fight."
SWI_economic_sufficiency_desc:0 "All aspects of the Swiss economy rely heavily on foreign imports in order to survive. We must work to move as many industries as possible inside of our own borders to reduce our reliance on foreign powers and encourage our economy to rely on internal sources for production."
SWI_liscense_foregin_designs_desc:0 "Foreign aircraft have proven to be deadly and effective in recent wars. Our own aircraft industry is in its infancy. Perhaps the best idea is to instead license foreign designs rather than having to spend valuable resources researching our own Swiss aircraft."
SWI_trans_alpine_tunnels_desc:0 "The tunnels running beneath the Alps form a powerful economic lifeline that cross through the centre of Europe. Expanding these tunnels will increase our ability to profit from our control of these railways."
SWI_promote_franc_desc:0 "The economic systems of our neighbour have seen disastrous free falls in the wake of Black Monday. This has affected the strengths of their currencies, and confidence in the financial markets has fallen. Promoting the Swiss Franc as the viable alternative to the failing German mark will serve to boost our own economy in the face of this economic crisis."
SWI_sell_war_bonds_desc:0 "Promotion of the Swiss Franc has begun boosting our economy, but the government is still heavily in debt. We must turn to the people in order to support the government in the face of war."
SWI_strategic_services_desc:0 "As a small nation in the centre of Europe, we cannot hope to win on strength alone. We must found a new intelligence service that can solve our problems before they can snowball out of control, and give us powerful intelligence on the moves of our enemies."
SWI_electronics_research_desc:0 "Developed as a replacement for the ageing German ciphers used by the Swiss Army prior to the Second Weltkrieg, the NEMA represents the nation's interests in ensuring that no other nation no matter how friendly, can read our mail."
SWI_issues_of_the_day_desc:0 "For many issues of public importance in Switzerland, the people are allowed to vote in nation-wide referendums, where the outcome is determined by popular vote. Focusing our efforts on these issues will ensure that we tackle the societal problems that people find important in their daily lives."
SWI_vienna_circle_desc:0 "The Austrians have recently made overtures to other nations close to them to participate in the Vienna Circle, a centre of technological advancement and learning in the heart of the Austrian Empire. Joining such a program would no doubt allow us to enjoy the fruit of these technological advancements."
SWI_strengthen_ties_desc:0 "Our continued relationship with our allies in the war is the lifeline keeping our nation from total collapse. We must make moves to ensure that this relationship holds for as long as we face a common foe."
SWI_an_official_alliance_desc:0 "While we are de-facto in an alliance with our wartime ally, it has become necessary to make the alliance a formal relationship. Our ally is that part of a larger network of allies, and joining this web as a formal participant can only serve to strengthen our position."
SWI_german_tech_sharing_desc:0 "The Kaiser Wilhelm Society is Germany's foremost centre of technological advancements and research. Applying for membership in such a prestigious collaboration effort will improve our ability to field a technologically advanced military force."
SWI_never_again_desc:0 "The Geneva Strikes of the early 1930s were caused by a failing and inefficient government. We have made steps to reform that government, but there are many who seek protections against such a tragedy ever occurring again. Thus the Syndicalist Unions are to be given their own military powers, so that the power rests solely in the hands of the Trade Unions."
SWI_the_peoples_republic_desc:0 "The people of Switzerland have made their wills clear. The crimes and failings of the past were caused by a government too strong for its own good, and too disconnected from the people, wallowing in its capitalist greed. Thus a new government must be formed, a government run solely by the people, and for the people."
SWI_totalitarian_regime_desc:0 "The people of Switzerland have made their wills clear. The crimes and failings of the past were caused by a people that could not protect themselves from foreign influences. The common people cannot hope to defend against such aggression by themselves. Thus a strong and competent state is necessary to safeguard the nation's future. Georges Oltramare and his Totalist Union Nationale party offer this necessary future."
SWI_loyalty_to_the_state_desc:0 "We must encourage loyalty to the state whenever possible, so that we may foster both a populace and a military that values the strength of the government and its ability to protect the people."
SWI_consolidate_power_desc:0 "There are dissenting voices still within the government that oppose the takeover of the government by loyal nationalist forces. These voices are muted, for now, but a consolidation is necessary if we are to identify and "rectify" those who still have misguided views on the government in Switzerland."
SWI_fortress_defense_desc:0 "If our enemies are so keen to attack us in our homes, then we will make such a network of interconnected fortifications that the very idea of assaulting Switzerland will fill the enemy with dread, as the imagine the many millions it will take to gain even a single kilometre of our land."
SWI_expansionist_military_desc:0 "Only through show of arms can we secure our nation's future. To this end, it is important that we instil a strong sense of national pride in all citizens of the nation, so that they will fight to the bitter end to defend their home and their state."
SWI_nuclear_program_desc:0 "The Study Commission for Nuclear Energy's purpose is to investigate the use of both nuclear power in providing for our nation's energy needs, and to evaluate the requirements for the advancement of a weaponized nuclear program for the defence of the nation."
SWI_uranium_mine_desc:0 "Switzerland is a small state compared to the titans of Europe. Thus we find it necessary to defend ourselves with all means available to us, even if we must bathe the continent in nuclear fire to achieve our goals."
SWI_expand_our_operations_desc:0 "With the world falling to chaos, the Military Intelligence Service must be called upon again and again to undertake more dangerous and more dubious tasks to defend the nation. Expanding their areas of influence and operational capacities will help them resolve whatever problem comes their way. No matter how unsavoury."
SWI_motorization_desc:0 "Our military is almost entirely composed of foot infantry and horse-drawn support. Our troops are slow to move and our supplies even slower to arrive. It is important that we invest in motorisation to keep our troops from fighting the next war with the last war's equipment."
SWI_armor_experiments_desc:0 "The Nahkampfkanone, an experimental Swiss AT Destroyer, has shown great promise in its initial field tests. This project has shown that we are capable of designing our own armoured vehicles, and that we should continue to invest in similar projects."
SWI_mechanized_desc:0 "Our initial motorisation efforts have proved most successful, but there is still more to do. In Germany, new mechanised Panzergrenadiers have begun to show promise as the fighting force of the future, and it is only wise that we follow in their footsteps and invest in our own mechanised forces."
SWI_new_academy_desc:0 "In the interwar period, our fighters relied on an informal school of training that involved local instructors and wildly differing levels of competence. Now that the Air Force is being reformed into a strong and professional force, we must take care to standardise our pilot training school to improve the quality of our pilots nationwide."
SWI_new_tactics_desc:0 "Bambini-Code is a brevity code recently developed to allow for easy communication between our fighter squadrons in the heat of combat. Its use has proven wildly effective, and promoting and requiring its use among our pilots will drastically improve their ability to perform against their counterparts."
SWI_bombers_desc:0 "The establishment of the Surveillance Squadrons will allow us to gain intelligence through fighter patrols in and around our borders while also maintaining a large nighttime presence."
SWI_air_factories_desc:0 "Flugzeugwerk Emmen is the nation's first dedicated aircraft factory, and is designed to construct the first of many planes in the Swiss Air Force."
SWI_strategic_bombing_desc:0 "The acceleration of our previous raiding campaigns have taught us that if we are to continue, we must invest in large strategic bombing forces. These forces will allow us to project our power across the continent while maintaining our air force entirely within the confines of Switzerland."
SWI_defensive_constructions_desc:0 "Our previous projects have given us extensive experience and knowledge in the proper construction and design of fortifications. We can take advantage of this knowledge and create new defensive networks wherever they are needed."
SWI_new_roadways_desc:0 "Our nation is one with twisting roadways and extensive railways that connect cities separated by large mountain ranges. It is important that we update and maintain our extensive rail networks so that we may move goods and soldiers around the nation as easily as possible. Electrifying tour rail lines with power from our hydroelectric dams will ensure they run as efficiently as possible."
SWI_develop_cantons_desc:0 "We must make a concerted effort to develop all regions of the nation equally. To this end, we must allow the Cantons autonomy in their own development and construction of infrastructure."
SWI_canton_improvement_desc:0 "Industrial gains are important not only on the national level, but in the individual Cantons themselves, too. This initiative will give the Cantons the authority and funding they need to create their own local industrial zones to add production to the national output."
SWI_swiss_seas_desc:0 "It is time that we put our extensive knowledge of the seas to good use. We have found ourselves in possession of a new coastline for our previously landlocked state, and should take every advantage in forming a new navy as quickly as we are able."
SWI_military_factories_desc:0 "Oerlikon-Bührle is the largest producer of arms and artillery in the nation. Their weapons constitute almost half of our nations arms exports, and giving them valued government subsidies will not only increase their productivity but ensure our soldiers are equipped with the highest quality weapons."
SWI_final_factories_desc:0 "The war is becoming a large drain on our stockpiles of arms and ammunition. Our trade with foreign powers is not only insufficient, but unreliable. We must transition not only our industrial quarters but all parts of our society to a war footing if we are to produce enough weapons to last the conflict."
SWI_expanding_the_shipyards_desc:0 "Our military adventures have found us currently in possession of several large shipyards. Theses shipyards, the first in our nation's history, could be used to produce the large blue water navy that the Swiss people have only ever dreamed of."
SWI_merchant_marine_desc:0 "Investing into a strong military navy would be a waste. By the time hostilities have ended, our navy will still be in its infancy. Meanwhile, we could instead use this time to invest heavily into our merchant marine, whose voyages could directly impact our international trade and bring back tidy profits."
SWI_military_navy_desc:0 "Rather than wasting our time focusing on trade, we should instead use our new naval facilities to facilitate the creation of a completely new Swiss Navy, one which can fight the navies of the other world powers."
SWI_seaborne_trade_routes_desc:0 "The Swiss economy is on an upswing that will last it for years to come. Now that we have sea access, it is our best interests to keep this momentum and begin investing into nautical trade routes to expand our wealth."
SWI_center_of_commerce_desc:0 "Our continued investment into the merchant marine and maritime trade, combined with the strong state of the Swiss economy, has allowed our ports to be known as strong centres of trade worldwide, with the economic gains from these cities flowing freely into our treasury."
SWI_independent_navy_desc:0 "The Lakes Flotilla of Switzerland now finds itself in possession of all of the facilities and materiel necessary to form a proper naval force. This newly created Swiss Navy must quickly adapt itself to combat on the high seas, or be sunk in the process."
SWI_naval_bombers_desc:0 "A combination of research into traditional bomber forces and naval innovations, the new Swiss naval bombers will drastically increase our ability to project power across the waves."
SWI_coastal_defense_desc:0 "While we move forward with our transition to a fully blue water navy, it is still of vital importance that we support the Lakes Flotilla, for they protect the waterways in and around Switzerland from outside aggression."
SWI_naval_officers_desc:0 "Switzerland's naval activities in previous years has consisted only of merchant marine sailors and the brown water Lakes Flotilla. We must take these few experienced men we can, and use them to train the next generation of proud Swiss sailors for our navy."
SWI_ship_designs_desc:0 "While we have come into the possession of new naval facilities, a first for this formerly landlocked state, we cannot move forward with a fleet without first investing in ship designs. Switzerland's naval tradition is small, and thus we must move forward to design a new fleet of ships as soon as possible to begin our training."
SWI_first_vessel_desc:0 "After several gruelling months of work, it is time for great celebration as the Swiss Navy officially christens its first ocean going naval vessel. This ship is the first of many in the new Swiss Fleet."
SWI_beneath_the_waves_desc:0 "While we have found ourselves in possession of large naval facilities and dockyards, it is not feasible to create a large traditional fleet. Instead we should focus on cheap and efficient submarines, so that we can project power without the decades-long investments a surface fleet requires."
SWI_surface_fleet_desc:0 "Our nation was formerly a landlocked state, one that could not properly project its power on the high seas. Now we find ourselves in the possession of multiple dockyards, and as an ascendant naval power. It is our duty to create a surface fleet that can go toe-to-toe with the old powers."

Fearful of potential revolutionary influence by the Commune of France, the central government in Bern reacted swiftly by sending in the Federal Army to break the strike.

### Events ###
swiss.1.t:0 "기장의 연설"
swiss.1.d:0 "It was a wonderful sunny day when Henri Guisan made his speech not only to all of the soldiers and officers in attendance, but to the whole of Switzerland. In his speech he praised the strength and unity of the Swiss people, and promised that victory was not only attainable, but assured. \nAs Guisan finished giving his lengthy and beautifully worded speech, he was greeted with thunderous applause from all in attendance. This will surely go down in Swiss history as a historic event."
swiss.1.a:0 "Inspirational to us all."
swiss.2.t:0 "Gathering the Army"
swiss.2.d:0 "Switzerland has maintained its neutrality in conflict for hundreds of years. We are a people that hold fast to our values of neutrality and peace. But now we find ourselves embroiled in a conflict for our very survival. The men are scared and many are unsure if they are capable of fighting at all. Seeing this weakness among the soldiers, Henri Guisan has decided to hold a large rally on the Rütli, the historic location of the Rütlischwur of 1291. All Swiss officers are to be in attendance, and the speech is to be made to inspire Swiss people across the nation."
swiss.2.a:0 "We await Guisan's speech."
swiss.3.t:0 "국민 투표: 공용어"
swiss.3.d:0 "Enough political capital has been raised to institute an official referendum today on an important topic to the Swiss people. The issue of whether or not to include Romansch as a national language of Switzerland is what is to be decided. If voted in, this predominantly Swiss language would join the likes of French, German, and Italian among Switzerland's national languages. Should we support this referendum?"

swiss.5.a:0 "훌륭하군!"
swiss.6.t:0 "The Language Referendum Fails"

swiss.6.a:0 "The people did not support it."
swiss.7.t:0 "국민 투표: 연방 헌법 개정"
swiss.7.d:0 "There has been increasing support recently of a total revision to the Swiss constitution. This move is seen as necessary by many who have seen the escalating rift between French West and German East inside of the country, and believe that constitutional guarantees are the only way to mend this rift and improve the state of the nation. Many opponents believe that it will only be a stopgap measure, and that conflict between the government and Syndicalist movements are inevitable. Should we support this referendum?"

swiss.9.a:0 "훌륭하군!"
swiss.10.t:0 "The Constitutional Referendum Fails"

swiss.10.a:0 "The people did not support it."
swiss.11.t:0 "국민 투표: 경제 위기와의 전쟁"
swiss.11.d:0 "The recent disaster that was Black Monday has thrown the nation's economy into a dangerous downward spiral. There are actions that the government can, and will, take to combat this crisis, but this referendum is to decide whether the government can take extraordinary action outside of its usual power in order to resolve the crisis swiftly. Should we support this referendum?"

swiss.13.a:0 "훌륭하군!"
swiss.14.t:0 "The Economic Referendum Fails"
swiss.14.d:0 "It seems that the people do not believe that the government needs extra authority to solve the crisis. What does this mean for our economy?"
swiss.14.a:0 "The people did not support it."
swiss.15.t:0 "국민 투표: 생디칼리스트 연합 금지"
swiss.15.d:0 "It is no secret that Syndicalism has been spreading constantly over recent years inside of the nation. It shares a large border with the Syndicalist Commune of France, and the pains of the Geneva Massacre still fester in Romandy. This referendum is an extreme measure to combat this crisis at the root, and ban the Syndicalist Unions from the nation entirely. This move is sure to be controversial, especially with the French Commune. Should we support this referendum?"
swiss.15.a:0 "하지 않는다."
swiss.15.b:0 "약간의 선거 운동."

swiss.16.a:0 "제발요!"
swiss.17.t:0 "The Syndicalist Union Referendum Succeeds"
swiss.17.d:0 "Despite strong Syndicalist support is the Western regions of Switzerland, the referendum has succeeded. All existing Syndicalist Trade Unions are now dissolved and none are legally allowed to form again. This is sure to raise the ire of the French."
swiss.17.a:0 "훌륭하군!"
swiss.18.t:0 "The Syndicalist Union Referendum Fails"
swiss.18.d:0 "It seems that Syndicalist support was too strong, and the referendum has failed. Syndicalists will continue to meet as they have done over the past few years."
swiss.18.a:0 "The people did not support it."
swiss.19.t:0 "국민 투표: 군대 재조직"
swiss.19.d:0 "It has become clear that the old structure of the Swiss army is no longer fit for the coming years. Previously, the military has relied on strong reserve of quickly-trained volunteers in order to form the backbone of the army when in need, but the rise of strong professional armies all around Switzerland has made this model seem obsolete. This referendum proposes that we reform the army along the German model, and create a strong and professional standing force. Should we support this referendum?"

swiss.19.b:0 "약간의 선거 운동."

swiss.22.a:0 "The people did not support it."
swiss.23.t:0 "국민 투표: 프리메이슨리의 지위"
swiss.23.d:0 "Freemasonry has come into the public spotlight recently for its supposed connection to dangerous extremist movements and the prevalence of its members among higher levels of office. Freemasons are not believed by the state to be a real danger, but who really knows with such secretive societies? The public will have to say whether they are allowed to continue their practice within our borders. Should we support this referendum?"

swiss.25.t:0 "The Freemasonry Referendum Succeeds"
swiss.25.d:0 "The referendum has passed, and Freemasons have been barred from official meetings inside the nation. While there is likely little effect on the day-to-day of the government's operation, the public's support of the state has risen with the news."
swiss.25.a:0 "훌륭하군!"
swiss.26.t:0 "The Freemasonry Referendum Fails"

swiss.27.t:0 "국민 투표: 상품 운송에 관하여"
swiss.27.d:0 "The referendum of the day has to do with the current system of transport of goods along Swiss roadways. The proposed referendum would change how these goods are to be moved, and would potentially increase the overall volume of trade along major roadways. Should we support this referendum?"
swiss.27.a:0 "하지 않는다."

swiss.31.t:0 "국민 투표: 연방 정부 폐지"
swiss.31.d:0 "There is a heavy atmosphere over the crowds today as the nation moves forward with a referendum to abolish the current federal government, and invite the leading representatives from the nation's strongest Trade Unions to draft the foundation of a new government. French "allied" military personnel and observers are seen in full force throughout important civilian centres, and many know that a vote against the change is fruitless. The old Swiss government is no more."

swiss.33.t:0 "The Government Referendum Succeeds"
swiss.33.d:0 "It was truly a bizarre sight, as bands played bombastic tunes and parades were held to mostly unenthusiastic crowds in the wake of the referendum's success. The new Swiss government is to be formed shortly, but many in the conservative German East of the nation find nothing to celebrate."
swiss.33.a:0 "As if there was any doubt."
swiss.34.t:0 "스위스가 인터네셔널에 가입하려 하다."
swiss.34.d:0 "After the recent Syndicalist revolution rocked our small eastern neighbour, many assumed it would only be a matter of time before they joined the Third Internationale. Today is that day, as Swiss diplomats have officially requested that the nation be allowed into our alliance."

swiss.36.a:0 "Impossible!"
swiss.37.t:0 "스위스가 보호를 청하다"
swiss.37.d:0 "A diplomatic envoy arrived today from Switzerland with a missive explaining that the current government of Switzerland has found a need to join our military alliance. How should we respond?"

swiss.39.t:0 "독일이 우릴 무시하다!"
swiss.39.d:0 "Despite our diplomat's best efforts, we have been unable to get an official response from Germany with regards to our acceptance into Mitteleuropa. It seems that the Germans are keen on keeping us out of their alliance."
swiss.39.a:0 "But why?"
swiss.40.t:0 "Nationalist Coup"
swiss.40.d:0 "Before dawn broke over the governmental offices in the capital, it was already over. The Schweizerischer Vaterländischer Verband, a populist movement that held large influence over governmental affairs through its extensive membership in both the military and high government offices, had moved in the earliest hours of the morning to secure all necessary locations to ensure a successful coup. Hand-picked military units held important locations throughout the capital and the rest of the nation, and not a single shot was fired, nor a single life lost.\n\nThe previous government's failure to both protect the Swiss people in Romandy and secure foreign assistance against such a move had made it obvious to the Schweizerischer Vaterländischer Verband that the current government has failed completely, and only an entirely new government could hope to revitalise the Swiss nation.\n\nOne only hopes that their nationalistic tendencies can be kept in check."

swiss.41.d:0 "19세기에 스위스 연방은 위기에 빠졌습니다. 몇몇 주에서 자유주의가 힘을 얻으면서 민주주의와 중앙집권화를 요구했습니다. 보수 성향의 가톨릭을 믿는 주들은 1845년 존더분트를 만들어 이에 반대했습니다. 존더분트 전쟁이 1847년에 일어났고 자유주의자들이 이겼습니다. 1848년에 연방 헌법이 채택되었고, 이 헌법으로 주들의 느슨한 연합이었던 스위스는 베른에 새로 연방 수도를 둔 연방국가로 바뀌었습니다. 새 헌법으로 연방평의회 (Bundesrat), 연방의회 (Bundesversammlung), 연방법원 (Bundesgericht)과 같은 새로운 기관들이 만들어졌습니다. 국내에서 독일어 사용자와 프랑스어 사용자 간의 여러 분쟁이 있었지만 스위스는 세계 대전 동안 중립을 지켰습니다. 게다가 스위스가 전쟁 중인 국가들로 둘러쌓이면서 경제적인 문제들이 생겨났습니다. 급진 좌파가 이 기간 동안 많은 지지를 얻었고, 노동자 운동은 1919년 제네바에서 파업을 일으켜 주요 사회 개혁을 추진하려고 했습니다. 프랑스 생디칼리즘 확산에 대한 두려움과 뒤이은 스위스 정부의 탄압으로 이 시도는 실패로 끝났지만, 사회 개혁이 시작되면서 임금이 올라가거 근무 일수가 줄어들었습니다. 1919년에는 비례대표제가 도입되었습니다. 사회민주당의 세력이 강해지는 동안 보수적인 자유민주당은 유권자들 대다수를 잃었습니다. 1930년대에 들어서 사민주의자와 보수주의자 간의 갈등이 국내 정치를 지배했습니다. 스위스 공동체 간의 갈등이 이제 더 많은 정치적 가치를 가지게 되었습니다. 프랑스어 사용자들은 더 사회주의적이며, 독일어 사용자들은 더 보수적이고 이탈리아어 사용자들은 더 독실합니다. 유럽에서 심해지는 갈등이 중립을 유지하는 연합에 어떤 결과를 가져올까요?"

The Swiss Guard, a longstanding traditional guard of the pope, is to be expanded heavily and continuously supported by the current Swiss government.

swiss.65.t:0 "The Swiss Give In"
swiss.65.d:0 "After we properly informed the Swiss that their proposal to cede Romandy was not in our best interests, they have further shown their weakness and aversion to conflict by agreeing to our proposals of instituting reforms in the nation to protect the rights of Syndicalists in the nation.

swiss.71.d:0 "Earlier today fringe Syndicalist radicals "Union Nationale" held a rally in the streets of Geneva against the "wilful suppression" of the Swiss workers by the current government. While such a fringe rally would normally be of no concern, the sheer amount of people in attendance has caught the government's eye.\n\nThousands of people were in attendance, seemingly hanging on every word of the main speaker, Georges Oltramare.

The Bundesland of Vorarlberg, right on our eastern border with Austria, has held a public referendum to leave Austria behind and seek union with Switzerland.\n\nOver 80% of voters agreed with the proposal, and the local authorities have wasted no time pleading their case with us, hoping to avoid whatever cruel peace awaits them if Austria were to fall in their current war. The citizens of Vorarlberg are certainly willing, should we accept this new member of the Swiss state?"

We will have to deal with these traitors, in time."
swiss.73.a:0 "Damn them!"
swiss.74.t:0 "독일이 위기에 간섭하다"

swiss.78.d:0 "With the collapse of the government in Bern following the Syndicalist uprising, a loose coalition of Unions was formed to handle governmental affairs. It has become painfully apparent that this haphazard group of Unions is not capable of running the government and all its functions.\n\nInstead, a new government has been formed under the guidance of the Genenva Council of State, with the assistance of the French Commune.
