CHL_air2:0 "항공기 생산"
CHL_air2_desc:0 "The sudden cut of funding for the airforce is perhaps a key factor why it joined us in the Revolution; now we should take the utmost care to ensure that our airplanes are both modern and well cared for.

CHL_fighter3:0 "장거리 항공기 실험" #long range aircraft

CHL_fighter3_desc:0 "Our country is, from an strategical standpoint, too long in a North-South axis to be properly protected by common fighter craft. We must ensure, with the help of our comrades in Europe, that our Airforce has planes capable of long autonomous flights"

CHL_dockyard:0 "함대 재개장"
CHL_dockyard_desc:0 "Our fleet, while well armed and well supplied, has many second hand or outdated vessels; If we are to modernise it, we must spare no expense in dockyards, shipyards and weapon systems"

CHL_arms_of_the_revolution:0 "포위당한 국가"
CHL_arms_of_the_revolution_desc:0 "The biggest danger to Chile is not internal, but that of the resurrecting counter-revolutionary Argentina.

We will not let happen!"
CHL_mobility_potential:0 "잠재적인 기동성"
CHL_mobility_potential_desc:0 "Many have heard ideas and plans about how modern warfare will be a fast-paced, mechanised affair; even if that may not turn out to be the case, we do not have the manpower to engage in traditional war with Argentina and the other imperialists. We will do our best to improve the mobility of our forces"
CHL_communard_expertise:0 "코뮌 전문가"
CHL_communard_expertise_desc:0 "France's doctrine of aggression has many strong proponents, and they may be of great use to our cause, especially since among them are advisers and officers who are eager to be on the frontlines of the war against imperialism"
CHL_tanque:0 "전차에 집중"

CHL_tanque2:0 "전차 생산에 집중"

CHL_infantry:0 "군대 재무장"
CHL_infantry_desc:0 "While the army is not underpaid or underfed as it used to be before the Revolution, it is still poorly equipped. Let us attend to the needs of our officers and ensure our Army can fight off any threats"

CHL_mountaineers:0 "산악 여단 확장"
CHL_mountaineers_desc:0 "The Mountains that surround us are an integral part of any national defence plan in case of invasion. Passes, peaks and hillsides must not be garrisoned with fresh recruits, but with elite specially trained regiments who are ready for the harsh reality of mountain life"
CHL_andean_strategy:0 "안데스 전략"
CHL_andean_strategy_desc:0 "The so called Santiago Line will be the last stand of our nation, if Argentina overpowers us and crossed the Andes.

CHL_long_term_planning:0 "장기간 계획"

CHL_permanet:0 "영구적인 혁명 교리"
CHL_permanet_desc:0 "Something that Labarcists defend, the idea that the Revolution can only be maintained by force, for reactionary elements cannot be reasoned or bargained with. The Proletarian Dictatorship will be permanent until it's not longer necessary"
CHL_directrule:0 "중앙화된 계획"
CHL_directrule_desc:0 "All decisions about he economic and state well being must be consulted with Central Committees in Santiago. To do otherwise would be clumsy at best, treason at worse"
