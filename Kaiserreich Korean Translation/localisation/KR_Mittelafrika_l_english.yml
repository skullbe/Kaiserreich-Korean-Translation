### Leader Descriptions ###
POLITICS_GOERING_DESC:0 "Von Göring came to prominence as one of Germany's more succesful fighter pilots of the Weltkrieg, scoring more than twenty victories by the end of the war, which earned him numerous decorations. \n\nHis ambitions soon turned political with his becoming chair of the Alldeutsche Verband which he led to an 8% Electoral turnout in 1928. Following this, he was appointed to Mittelafrika by Wilhelm II himself who saw von Göring as a rising capable man. Von Göring sees this as a springboard and his ticket to claiming the chancellery after a successful term in the colonies."

### Events ###
mittel.1.t:0 "The Mozambique situation"
mittel.1.d:0 "During the Weltkrieg, the situation in Africa was truly paradoxical. The war in East Africa ended in a stalemate, where the Entente occupied German East Africa, while we occupied Mozambique. Both sides recruited thousands of Africans from 'enemy' territory as porters, armed guards or soldiers, and after the war we had to punish those who joined the Entente's side. Now, many of those natives are displaced across the Mozambique border and there are many rumours that the new extremist government in Portugal is planning to arm them against us."
mittel.1.a:0 "We must prepare."
mittel.2.t:0 "The Mozambique situation"
mittel.2.d:0 "During the Weltkrieg, the situation in Africa was truly paradoxical. The war in East Africa ended in a stalemate, where the Entente occupied German East Africa, while the Germans occupied our Mozambique. Both sides recruited thousands of Africans from 'enemy' territory as porters, armed guards or soldiers, and after the war the Huns led cruel reprisal attacks on the natives that joined our side. Since then, thousands of those natives have fled over the border into Mozambique where they now live in camps. These natives are a good opportunity to sow mischief in Mittelafrika, as many of them still want revenge for what the Huns did to them."
mittel.2.a:0 "Let's draw up a plan..."
mittel.3.t:0 "A chance for mischief in our rightful territories"
mittel.3.d:0 "There is a great opportunity for us to cause instability in Mittelafrika by arming angry displaced natives who live in camps in Mozambique. The more unstable Mittelafrika is, the better chance we have to retake our rightful territories shown in the Pink Map"
mittel.3.a:0 "Arm them as much as we can"
mittel.3.b:0 "Arm them with guns and ammo, but nothing else."
mittel.3.c:0 "Crack down on these hooligans"
mittel.4.t:0 "A Police Officer has been Shot!"
mittel.4.d:0 "A Makonde tribesman has shot one of our police officers in Lusaka! The city is still in shock and the perpetrator, along with any supporters, is now being detained for investigation by the local police. It has been theorised that he had acquired the weapons from across the border, in Portugal's colonies."
mittel.4.a:0 "Terrible!"
mittel.5.t:0 "Another Police Officer has been Shot!"
mittel.5.d:0 "Another Policeman, this time from Lilongwe, has been shot by a radicalised native, who is a member of the Makonde tribe. The cause of his radicalisation and the source of his weapons are still being investigated, however it is possible that he had received them from Portugal."
mittel.5.a:0 "Terrible!"
mittel.6.t:0 "A Third Police Officer has been Shot!"
mittel.6.d:0 "Tragedy has struck Dar es Salaam! Yet again, for the third time, a police officer has been shot: this time by a member of the Makonde tribe. The Dar es Salaam police are now searching for the murderer and the cause of the attack; Portuguese involvement is suspected."
mittel.6.a:0 "Terrible!"
mittel.7.t:0 "Plantation Burned!"
mittel.7.d:0 "A cashew plantation in Njassaland has been burned down by 'bandits' operating from across the Portuguese border. They've taken as much as they could of the recently harvested crop, burned the rest down and escaped back into Portuguese Mozambique."
mittel.7.a:0 "Something must be done about this!"
mittel.8.t:0 "Military Depot Raided!"
mittel.8.d:0 "The 'bandits' don't ever fear the famous might of our Askari anymore! They have raided and stolen supplies from one of our military depots and escaped with them back to their camp in Mozambique."
mittel.8.a:0 "Portugal must put an end to this!"
mittel.9.t:0 "Portugal must put a stop to this!"
mittel.9.d:0 "We should launch a formal complaint against Portugal. The continued existence of these 'bandit' camps possess a clear threat to our colony. If they cannot deal with a few bandits, they're clearly not fit to be a colonial power."
mittel.9.a:0 "Summon the Portuguese Consul! We will deal with this ourselves!"
mittel.9.b:0 "Perhaps a further escalation is in our interests after all..."
mittel.9.c:0 "We shall take this all the way to Berlin!"
mittel.10.t:0 "A Matter from Afrika"
mittel.10.d:0 "Our Mittelafrikan Statthalter has come to us with a request for aid, he speaks of Portugal supporting bandits that murder German and Afrikan police and endanger our rule in Afrika, what should we do?"
mittel.10.a:0 "Our relations with Portugal are too important, refuse to help"
mittel.10.b:0 "We shall take up the matter with Portugal"
mittel.11.t:0 "The Kaiser refuses"
mittel.11.d:0 "The Kaiser has refused to help us, telling us to deal with these bandits ourselves and to stop ruining German relations with Portugal. We cannot expect any help from Berlin"
mittel.11.a:0 "Damn!"
mittel.12.t:0 "The Germans come knocking"
mittel.12.d:0 "The Germans in Der es Salaam have come to their overlords in Berlin, and told them about our support of rebels in their territory, now Berlin demands we produce an explanation for our actions..."
mittel.12.a:0 "Explain the situation"
mittel.12.b:0 "We do not discuss internal affairs with foreign nations"
mittel.13.t:0 "Portugal explains the situation"
mittel.13.d:0 "The Portuguese Ambassador explained in great detail the chaotic situation in the Rumuva region..."
mittel.13.a:0 "Who knew Afrika was so complicated!"
mittel.14.t:0 "The foreign office declares the matter solved"
mittel.14.d:0 "The Portuguese have made some token arrests, and the bandit war has calmed down for now, but the war is far from over, no matter what Berlin says."
mittel.14.a:0 "There is more yet to come..."
mittel.15.t:0 "Mittelafrika threatens our colonies"
mittel.15.d:0 "The Germans in Dar es Salaam have noticed our support of rebels in their territories, and are now demanding we crack down on the rebels or 'face consequences'. What should we do?"
mittel.15.a:0 "Excellent, perhaps we can avenge 1918!"
mittel.15.b:0 "We have no choice, disarm the Ruga-Ruga, by force if needed"
mittel.16.t:0 "Portugal disarms the rebels!"
mittel.16.d:0 "The Portuguese have disarmed the bandits they have been sending into our territory at great cost to their own colonial stability. This matter is now truly solved"
mittel.16.a:0 "Independent action pays off"
mittel.17.t:0 "Portugal stands against us!"
mittel.17.d:0 "The Portuguese have refused to disarm the bandits they've been sending into our colonies, if we wish to stop this, we will have to take real action against Portugal..."
mittel.17.a:0 "Send in the troops, if they won't or can't clear out the bandits, we will."
mittel.17.b:0 "We can't make our, yet...."
mittel.18.t:0 "Mittelafrika stands down"
mittel.18.d:0 "The German weaklings in Dar es Salaam have stood down from stopping our bandit attacks, we can now freely continue these attacks as we please"
mittel.18.a:0 "Hah!"
mittel.19.t:0 "The Germans cross the border"
mittel.19.d:0 "The Germans have crossed the border into Mozambique to destroy the bandits, completely wrecking our national sovereignty. We must choose what to do"
mittel.19.a:0 "Repel Them!"
mittel.19.b:0 "Stand Down"
mittel.20.t:0 "Portugal Caves In!"
mittel.20.d:0 "The Portuguese have decided not to resist our troops during our raid into Mozambique, we now have military control of Mozambique and must decide our next action:"
mittel.20.a:0 "Only occupation will bring peace"
mittel.20.b:0 "Burn down the camps and leave"
mittel.21.t:0 "Mittelafrika seizes Northern Mozambique"
mittel.21.d:0 "The Mittelafrikans have occupied yet another one of our rightful territories, Northern Mozambique has been seized by the Mittelafrikan soldiers that entered our territory"
mittel.21.a:0 "Damn them!"
mittel.22.t:0 "Mittelafrika burns down camps!"
mittel.22.d:0 "The Mittelafrikan raid into our territory has ended, after burning down our bandit camps and slaughtering most of their inhabitants, their troops withdrew back into Mittelafrikan territory"
mittel.22.a:0 "That is the end of that"
mittel.23.t:0 "A deal with South Africa"
mittel.23.d:0 "The Portuguese are proving to be dangerous to white rule in Africa. The Boers in South Africa have had their eyes on the southern half of Mozambique since the Weltkrieg. Perhaps they could help us?"
mittel.23.a:0 "Send an envoy to the National Party"
mittel.23.b:0 "We don't need their help in dealing with Portugal"
mittel.24.t:0 "Mittelafrika's proposal"
mittel.24.d:0 "A Mittelafrikan envoy has arrived, claiming that Portugal is a dangerously irresponsible administrator of its African colonies, and has proposed a secret compact to divide Mozambique between us. We would get a good share of the spoils, which would be sure to please our land hungry Boer population, but the Anglophones look at Mittelafrika with suspicion and fear, and prefers Portugal as an ally. Drastic action at this point would be highly contentious, especially with the looming elections..."
mittel.24.a:0 "Consider all our options, stall for time"
mittel.24.b:0 "It's an opportunity we can't afford to turn down"
mittel.25.t:0 "Negotiations with South Africa"
mittel.25.d:0 "South Africa has stalled. The South Africans have refused to say no, but they won't commit, and won't even say what it is they want. We suspect that the South Africans don't want to make a momentous decision before their highly contested elections. The Boer population and their National Party favours our position and is pushing to sign the deal, while the English settlers and their Dominion Party favour the Portuguese. We should watch the upcoming elections closely, as victory or defeat for the Boers could decide this whole conflict"
mittel.25.a:0 "We should back the Boers"
mittel.26.t:0 "South Africa accepts"
mittel.26.d:0 "Our friends in South Africa have accepted the deal, and have managed to push it through their parliament. With their support, Portugal will be unable to resist us. We should move to demand the partition of the Mozambique now."
mittel.26.a:0 "Send a man to Portugal, it's time to finish this"
mittel.28.t:0 "Mittelafrikan-South African alliance"
mittel.28.d:0 "The Mittelafrikans have turned South Africa against us with promises of land in southern Mozambique. There is no way we can resist their combined forces, perhaps we must give Mozambique up..."
mittel.28.a:0 "Damn the Boers"
mittel.28.b:0 "War!"
mittel.29.t:0 "Portugal surrenders Mozambique"
mittel.29.d:0 "The Portuguese have surrendered Mozambique as we had wanted, it is now time to fulfill our promises of partition with our friends in South Africa. The problems with Portugal are now over."
mittel.29.a:0 "God bless the Boers"
mittel.30.t:0 "We've gained Southern Mozambique!"
mittel.30.d:0 "Our alliance with Mittelafrika has payed off, the Portuguese have surrendered Mozambique to Mittelafrika and they have given the southern part of it to us. What a great time for South Africa!"
mittel.30.a:0 "Hooray!"
mittel.31.t:0 "A plot in South Africa!"
mittel.31.d:0 "Members of the Dominion party of South Africa have told our ambassador in Pretoria that the Germans have been in secret negotiations with their government, offering to divide Mozambique with them if they support an attack on our colony. They assure us that they are doing everything in their power to stall negotiations, but if the National Party wins the next election, they could have a parliamentary majority, and nothing will stop them. However, if the Dominion Party were to win, they would not only halt negotiations but offer to guarantee our colonies! For the sake of our colonial security, it is essential that we ensure the Dominion Party and English settlers secure control of South Africa"
mittel.31.a:0 "We must back the Anglos"
mittel.32.t:0 "The National Party wins the civil war"
mittel.32.d:0 "The Boers have defeated their Anglo rivals in the South African civil war, it is now time to approach them again with our offer to split Mozambique, perhaps there will be a different reaction this time."
mittel.32.a:0 "Send another envoy"
mittel.33.t:0 "Mittelafrika returns"
mittel.33.d:0 "The Mittelafrikans have returned with the offer to split Mozambique with them, now that we have dealt with the Dominionists, we will be able to freely support Mittelafrika if we wish"
mittel.33.a:0 "Agree to the offer, it is time to take Mozambique"
mittel.33.b:0 "Decline, we must rebuild our divded nation"
mittel.34.t:0 "The Dominionists win the civil war"
mittel.34.d:0 "The Anglo settlers in South Africa have won the civil war, we must now remind them of their offer to protect our colonies from Mittelafrikan aggression. With no Boers to bother them, they should be able to push it through parliament"
mittel.34.a:0 "Send an envoy"
mittel.35.t:0 "An offer from Portugal"
mittel.35.d:0 "Now that we have dealt with our Boer rivals, the Portuguese have sent an envoy offering us an alliance of mutual protection against Mittelafrikan aggression, this may be a good idea as Mittelafrika was heavily invested in the Boers we have just defeated"
mittel.35.a:0 "Agree to the offer"
mittel.35.b:0 "Decline, we must rebuild our nation"
mittel.36.t:0 "South Africa accepts!"
mittel.36.d:0 "Our friends in South Africa have accepted our offer, and we now enter a pact of mutual protection with them. We can now continue to support rebels against Mittelafrika with no fear from retaliation, as they cannot defeat both of us"
mittel.36.a:0 "Great!"
mittel.37.t:0 "The assassination of Hans-Albert von Lettow-Vorbeck"
mittel.37.d:0 "Today, Hans-Albert von Lettow-Vorbeck, son of the famed general and first Statthalter of Mittelafrika Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, and promising officer in his own right, was shot to death in broad daylight in the city of Mbeya. The killer was of the Ngoni ethnic group, and was deported to Mozambique at the age of 4 along with his family after the execution of his father in 1921. He claims the assassination as vengeance for the death of his father, but we suspect he was at least given assistance by the Portuguese. A state funeral for Vorbeck and a military expedition are being prepared. and the old guard are crying out for blood. If we do not act now, when?"
mittel.37.a:0 "Declare war on Portugal! For vengeance!"
mittel.37.b:0 "It is too risky, we must hold back..."
mittel.37.c:0 "The pact Portugal has with South Africa holds us back, it is too dangerous..."
mittel.38.t:0 "Mittelafrika declares war!"
mittel.38.d:0 "One of our operatives has murdered a high value target in Mittelafrika, out of sheer rage the Statthalter has declared an invasion of our territories. We must now defend them with our blood, war is upon us."
mittel.38.a:0 "Angola e Nossa!"
mittel.39.t:0 "Defeat in Africa"
mittel.39.d:0 "The Mittelafrikans have defeated our forces in Africa, it may be time to surrender our colonies for now, let us see what it is Mittelafrika wants out of this war..."
mittel.39.a:0 "Send an envoy, we surrender"
mittel.39.b:0 "We shall never surrender!"
mittel.40.t:0 "The Portuguese surrender"
mittel.40.d:0 "We have defeated the Portuguese in Africa, and they have started negotiations to surrender. It is now time to decide what it is we want to get out of this war. The old guard suggests we should take only northern Mozambique, as it was our original goal in this war. Members of the NKR suggest taking all of Mozambique or establishing security zones in Mozambique and Angola, while the most radical members of our administration say we should strip Portugal of all African holdings, what shall be done?"
mittel.40.a:0 "Listen to the old guard, take only northern Mozambique"
mittel.40.b:0 "Establish security zones in Mozambique and Angola"
mittel.40.c:0 "Only taking all of Mozambique will ensure safety"
mittel.40.e:0 "Portugal has forfeited their colonial holdings with their reckless behaviour, take it all!"
mittel.41.t:0 "Defeat in Africa"
mittel.41.d:0 "The Portuguese have defeated our forces in Vorbecksland. Perhaps it is time to offer our surrender, if we lose any more land it could be disastrous for our colonial stability..."
mittel.41.a:0 "Offer our surrender"
mittel.41.b:0 "We shall never surrender!"
mittel.42.t:0 "Mittelafrika surrenders!"
mittel.42.d:0 "The German weakling have been defeated by our glorious armies! We have finally avenged 1918 and can establish the 'Pink Map' vision our greatest minds have had for a long time. Demand Vorbecksland and Njassaland, this is the start of the new Portuguese empire!"
mittel.42.a:0 "Hoorah for Portugal!"
mittel.43.t:0 "The Kenyatta-Solf Affair"
mittel.43.d:0 "An unusual case has reached the highest court in the German State. Anti-Colonial activist Jomo Kenyatta has brought a class action lawsuit against former Afrikan Statthalter Wilhelm Solf. The case has become something of an embarrassment, as some of the plaintiffs are veterans of the Great War, it can not be easily dismissed. They claim that Solf's administration harmed them through policies of illegal land seizures, and even abductions and torture, all done with Solf's knowledge and little legal basis. Quietly, the foreign office has explained to the government that such things are common and necessary in our colonial administration. They strongly urge we quash this motion."
mittel.43.a:0 "The court has no right to rule on Mittelafrikan affairs."
mittel.43.b:0 "What's the worst that could happen?"
mittel.44.t:0 "The Kenyatta-Solf Affair"
mittel.44.d:0 "Disaster! We have been watching the litigation of Jomo Kenyatta for years with nervous anticipation, and now our worst fears have been realised. Former Statthalter Wilhelm Solf has been found liable for 'extralegal' actions taken as Statthalter. The damages were not ruinous to Solf, but it has opened a door, to theoretically limitless cases. Already, Statthalter von Göring has resigned in protest. In the aftermath, legal reform and a more 'normalized' governance of Africa is the only viable option, and the only person willing to take charge and implement these reforms is Theodor von Hassel, may god help him."
mittel.44.a:0 "Gott mitt uns"
mittel.45.t:0 "The Kenyatta-Solf Affair"
mittel.45.d:0 "Our Administration has been watching with nervous anticipation the progression of the Kenyatta-Solf Affair, in which a Kikuyu lawyer is leading a class action lawsuit against former Statthalter Wihelm Solf. Fortunately, the defence lawyer Carl Schmitt produced a novel defence, that has established a new legal precedent: "Sovereign is he who decides on the exception." The courts accepted this argument, that the Statthalter is the sovereign authority in Africa, and has the right to 'step outside' normal legal proceedings. This obviously has startling implications, and some members of our administration already eagerly anticipate a 'Sovereign Statthalter'"
mittel.45.a:0 "The Sovereign is he who decides on the exception"
mittel.46.t:0 "The Black Dossier"
mittel.46.d:0 "A group of anonymous officers and administrators in Mittelafrika have compiled documentation and evidence of illegal activity by Statthalter von Göring and presented it to the Cabinet. The evidence, if true, is very serious. According to what they allege, Statthalter von Göring has been using the generous state budget we have provided him with to buy off politicians throughout Mitteleuropa in order to secure support for his administration, as well as demanding state officials pay into a slush fund. Even more darkly, it alleges with less evidence that von Göring and his loyalists gather information for blackmail against his own employees, has been involved in the kidnapping and intimidation of journalists, and even hiring assassins!"
mittel.46.a:0 "A formal investigation must be conducted immediately!"
mittel.46.b:0 "This implicates some powerful men in Berlin, quietly bury it"
mittel.47.t:0 "The corruption investigation"
mittel.47.d:0 "It has come to our attention that Berlin has begun investigating certain financial irregularities. It is not hard to imagine who is behind this: they would have to have access to the highest level of financial planning in the Administration, likely the Alter Kämpfer who fought under von Lettow-Vorbeck, and who have resisted every change of this administration!"
mittel.47.a:0 "Quash this investigation"
mittel.47.b:0 "Contain von Göring, and quietly change administration"
mittel.48.t:0 "The Kaiser's Warrant"
mittel.48.d:0 "Seeing von Göring fiercely resist any attempt at offical investigation, the German government has seen it fit to issue an arrest warrant for the Statthalter, on the grounds of obstruction of justice."
mittel.48.a:0 "The Sovereign is he who decides on the exception"
mittel.48.b:0 "Fetch me a ship, I shall fight this battle in court!"
mittel.49.t:0 "The Sovereign Statthalter"
mittel.49.d:0 "Hermann von Göring has refused to step down. Through his intermediary Karl Schmitt, he has argued that the Statthalter is a sovereign office, able to step outside the law, and secure with loyal members of his army, we have no easy means of resolving the crisis. Having won the Kenyatta-Solf Affair, Schmitt argues that this situation takes precedence from the affair, and therefore should be subject to the same ruling."
mittel.49.a:0 "Issue a new warrant for von Göring's arrest, for treason!"
mittel.49.b:0 "von Göring has legal precedence, step down for now."
mittel.50.t:0 "The German Response"
mittel.50.d:0 "The German government has declared von Göring's administration finished, but he still holds the reigns of power for now. He has ridden the tiger of this crisis this far, and now he cannot get off. Everywhere, the chain of command breaks down."
mittel.50.a:0 "Gott, hilf uns!"
mittel.51.t:0 "The Black Dossier"
mittel.51.d:0 "Not satisfied with the Cabinet's decision, the discontented officers of Africa have leaked their evidence and allegations to the press. While we are pushing back against the more wild, and baseless speculation, it's clear to the public an investigation is necessary."
mittel.51.a:0 "Damn! It was worth a try!"
mittel.52.t:0 "Friends in Berlin"
mittel.52.d:0 "It seems that some of our disgruntled administrators have made an appeal directly to the German Cabinet, trying to go over von Göring's head to have him removed. Fortunately, our friends in Berlin have ensured the cabinet will take no action, for now."
mittel.52.a:0 "Traitors in our midst, but friends in Berlin."
mittel.53.t:0 "The Muckrackers"
mittel.53.d:0 "While our friends in the government dismissed the accusations presented to it, it was leaked to the press. The honour of the Statthalter has been impinged, and this has given strength to the numerous journalists scuttling about Africa hoping to be the 'next E.D. Morel'"
mittel.53.a:0 "Damn them all!"
mittel.54.t:0 "A New Statthalter"
mittel.54.d:0 "With von Göring gone, we must select a new Statthalter. While he is disgraced, there is still hope for a New Colonial Regime to bring order to the colony. Or, perhaps the old ways, advocated by the Deutsche Kolonialgesellschaft are best. Or lastly, reform may be the only way to prevent exactly this kind of behaviour."
mittel.54.a:0 "The New Colonial Regime stays!"
mittel.54.b:0 "The Old Guard knows best!"
mittel.54.c:0 "Reform is the new way forward!"
mittel.55.t:0 "An NKR Statthalter"

He is both an accomplished author, with his best seller “Storm of Steel” and an educated entomologist, using his time in Africa to discover and document numerous species, while introducing our Askari to 'stormtrooper tactics'. Jünger broke with the German Army after a dispute carried through a series of articles published in military journals in the mid-20s.\n\nUnable to convince the General Staff to adopt his views, he took a transfer to Africa, where he was more free to implement his theories on the importance of psychology in modern warfare. A member of the Neue Kolonialregierung, Ernst Jünger will bring what he calls a “new spirit of adventure” to the colonisation of Africa, as well as help us reform our infantry tactics."

A former General and current politician, Ritter von Epp fought in the Herero uprising and the ensuing repression, and earned the Pour le Mérite for his service in the Weltkrieg. After the war, Chancellor Ludendorf appointed him as the first postwar governor of Kamerun. Returning to Germany after serving as governor for three years, Ritter von Epp turned to politics, funding the creation of several patriotic newspapers, and serving in the Bavarian chamber of Imperial Counsellors. Ritter von Epp has never tried to hide his close ties to the Ludendorf dictatorship, and remains an outspoken apologist for Ludendorf. He is a controversial, almost belligerent figure, but the Kaiser has decided a fighting man is what Africa needs.

He's also been active in politics, providing financial support to right-wing parties and newspapers. He breaks from the right however in his outspoken support for higher wages and benefits for workers. He believes, like Bismarck before him, that the threat of Socialism can be averted by assuring a decent standard of living for it's workers. Thyssen claims it has the added benefit that well paid workers can purchase more German-made products, stimulating the economy. Some are calling this model of paying workers high enough wages to purchase industrial output and ensure loyalty 'Thyssenism.' Frtitz Thyssen has long been associated with the Neue Kolonialregierung, with rumors circulating that he helped fund Hermann von Göring's rise in politics, or that he was involved in the financial slush fund alleged in the 'Black Dossier'. None of these allegations have been proven yet, and the Kaiser has appointed Thyssen to the position of Statthalter, with a special eye to increase mining output in the Congo."

The young commander Bockholt flew the Airship L 59 “Die Afrika-schiff” from Jamboli Airstation in Bulgaria to the Mahange plateau in Tanjanika, after a grueling 100 hour flight across the deserts of Egypt and Sudan. The voyage resupplied our armies in Afrika with new weapons, ammunition, and most critically, quinine, that helped keep our armies in good fighting order until the Peace with Honour. It was the only resupply of East Afrika during the war, and holds other distinctions such as the longest military flight record, and flying the first aerial resupply mission. Because the mission was a one-way trip, Buckholt served the rest of the war as a naval infantry officer in the East Afrikan Theatre. After the war, Commodore Bockholt continued to refine his aerial resupply tactics and equipment, creating air mobile and later paratrooper naval infantry units. Despite such an innovative spirit, he is one of the leading officers of the Deutsche Kolonialgesellschaft, and proved to be a thorn in the side of Statthalter von Göring, clashing with him frequently on the direction, and command of Mittelafrika's Air Force.

After the war, he took divisional command, and put down rebellions in the Upper Kongo and Ruvuma Valley. In 1925, he would be the one to negotiate the entry of German troops into British East Africa, and conduct the occupation.

His most notable, and controversial work has been with his policy of 'Bezirksleiterrecht,' a policy of legitimizing and formalizing local and tribal law, and giving district officers the power to defer to this law in place of German Law. This has had been tried in Samoa with some success in reducing conflict with the locals. With such a long history in Imperial and Foreign affairs, he naturally has a close relationship with the Deutsche Kolonialgesellschaft, and will favour their ideas in decision making.

After the Maji Maji war, von Hassel left the Schutztruppe to found a coffee farm, but volunteered for service during the Weltkrieg. After the war, he returned to his coffee plantation, which has grown into one of the most successful in Tanjanika. Dissatisfied with the way settlers like him were treated, and helped into politics by his father in law, the politician Jacob Jebsen, Theodor von Hassel spent years agitating on behalf of settlers' rights to democratic representation, as well as economic and political rights.The Kaiser has seen this man represents the will of the white and educated native population of Africa, and has deemed him worthy of being Statthalter."

mittel.125.d:0 "When we moved into British Territory in 1926, the British hold on the territory was dangerously weak after 7 years of warfare. The 1926 British strikes coincided with a series of protests by the natives in British East Africa. In 1925, the Church of Scotland Mission declared the practice of female circumcision banned for Christians, labelling it Female Genital Mutilation. For the dominant ethnic group of the region, the Kikuyu, the practice, which they call irua, is the 'conditio sine qua non' of the whole teaching of tribal law, religion. They felt so strongly about this that it has caused a rupture within the Christian community in Kikuyuland. The Anglican Church quickly followed the Scottish Church in banning the practice, but in response, the Kikuyu have created their own 'African Churches'. They've established their own theological schools, which have become a hotbed of Kikuyu nationalism. At the same time, with the fall of Britain to socialism, there is a schism within the Anglican and Scottish churches themselves. In Canterbury Cathedral, the Union of Britain has declared Archbishop John Hobbis Harris as the head of worldwide Anglican communion, while in Ottawa, the British Monarch has declared, under his authority as Supreme Governor of the Church of England Archbishop Cosmo Gordan Lang as the head of the communion. The Scottish Kirk has seen a similar schism. It is impossible to tell for certain who any given Anglican minister believes is the real head of the church, and they might be listening to Archbishop Harris, who is a campaigner against imperialism in Africa."

Naturally, we suspect Kikuyu religious extremists."
mittel.126.a:0 "Barbaric"
mittel.127.t:0 "The Kenyan Highlands settlement policy"
mittel.127.d:0 "The Highlands of Kenya are one of the few areas of Africa suitable to white settlement. The rare combination of cool uplands combined with healthy soil creates a climate almost like that of Europe, and excellent for farming. It is no wonder that the land there is in high demand.\n\nUnfortunately, it's long been economically underused. The British settlers have proven more interested in establishing themselves as landholders and letting the native Kikuyu do the labour. If we opened the land up to small German farmers squeezed by the Junker estates, we could improve productivity and increase our influence on the region, but it would also make the land shortage even more intense."

mittel.128.t:0 "Land crisis in the Kenyan Highlands"
mittel.128.d:0 "Allowing German settlement in the Highlands of Kenia has only exacerbated the problems in the region, as it has set off land speculation, with prices rising out of control, and conflicts and disputes breaking out over the demarcation of a few meters of land. To make matters worse, for the local Kikuyu tribes, a man is not considered an adult until he owns at least some land. There are tribal territories set aside for this, but they are massively overcrowded, with most of them owning no land and working on British plantations. Additionally, an increasing amount of land within the tribal areas is monopolised by the local chiefs. This land shortage is creating unrest on all sides."

Waruhiu was our senior collaborative official among the Kikuyu. Our security officials have been been noting the rise of religious, oath based violence among the Kikuyu. Supposedly, they conduct ‘magic rituals’ under the cover of darkness, and swear oaths to kill white settlers. By killing Senior Chief Waruhiu, who had a body guard and was held in high esteem by our administration, they’ve demonstrated there’s almost no one in the Kenian Highlands they couldn’t kill, right now."

MAF_Protect_Animals_desc:0 "It's incredulous to think, but some of the most iconic species of Africa, particularly the lion, are in danger of being totally exterminated, as the wolf was from Europe. In 1870, the last Atlas Bear was shot by hunters. Our Statthalter has a particular interest in pushing laws that ensure this will not happen to our native species."
MAF_Kulturkampf:0 "A Second Kulturkampf"
MAF_Kulturkampf_desc:0 "In the 1870s, the German Parliament passed 22 laws to curb the power of the Catholic Church. By ruthlessly enforcing these laws, we can curb foreign elements, and also ensure the monopoly of our own secular and German education system."
MAF_Proving_Grounds:0 "Swapokmund Proving Grounds"
MAF_Proving_Grounds_desc:0 "To train our most capable administrators and public servants, we send them to the Namibian desert for a week of harsh training and research where they are forced to rely on all the skills they have learnt so far to command a small desert settlement. While this does cause a few deaths a year, it makes our administration among the best trained in the world."
MAF_Army_Reforms:0 "Reform the Army"
MAF_Army_Reforms_desc:0 "The African Askari in 1914 was up to the standard of the contemporary European soldier. Today, he is still up to the standard of 1914. He is not ready for the kind of mechanised, artillery intensive battles we saw in Europe by the end of the war. We must fix this."
MAF_Long_Range_Airforce:0 "A Long Range Airforce"
MAF_Long_Range_Airforce_desc:0 "Africa is far from the major theatres of war. In order to engage our enemies, we must construct a fleet of long range bombers capable of even transoceanic voyages. Even if we never use it, our ability to project air power across the Indian and Atlantic oceans will greatly improve our prestige."
MAF_Heavy_Equipment:0 "Heavy Equipment"
MAF_Heavy_Equipment_desc:0 "If our military is to match the standards of Germany, we shall need equipment: tanks, planes, artillery guns, these are the weapons of modern war!"
MAF_Africa_Army:0 "The Africa Divisons"
MAF_Africa_Army_desc:0 "Now that we have achieved parity in modern warfare, it is not enough for our Askaris to serve as a colonial police force. Like the Gurkhas for the British, and Senegalese for the French, the best of the native populace will serve as shock troops for the German army."
MAF_Strategic_Export:0 "Strategic Resources Export"
MAF_Strategic_Export_desc:0 "In the event of war, Mittelafrika must serve to feed the great German war machine. Expanding our production of strategic resources will ensure we can outproduce our enemies and strengthen the Fatherland."
MAF_African_Breadbasket:0 "The African Breadbasket"
MAF_African_Breadbasket_desc:0 "Much of Africa has little in the way of agricultural development, but what we do have is invested in cash crops suitable only for the tropics. The last Weltkrieg showed that Germany is vulnerable to its lack of foodstuffs, and so by focusing on staples such as corn and rice, rather than tobacco and pepper, we can help ensure victory."
MAF_African_War_Industries:0 "African War Industries"
MAF_African_War_Industries_desc:0 "African laborers will work for far less than the average German, if we pay them at all. It makes sense therefore to encourage the development of simple manufacturing processes suitable to Africa instead."
MAF_War_Economy:0 "A War Economy"
MAF_War_Economy_desc:0 "War is inevitable, and time is precious. In the Weltkrieg, we gained a great advantage by mobilising faster than the British in Africa. We must be the first to mobilise in the next war as well."
MAF_Start_Heydrich_Reforms:0 "Start Heydrich Reforms"
MAF_Start_Heydrich_Reforms_desc:0 "In order to be of use to our Fatherland, our naval facilities must be expanded to accommodate larger ships, even battleships and aircraft carriers."
MAF_Cont_Heydrich_Reforms:0 "Continue Heydrich Reforms"
MAF_Cont_Heydrich_Reforms_desc:0 "By purchasing vessels from German shipyards, and purchasing antiquated vessels from the Kriegsmarine, we can stimulate the German economy and strengthen our own naval industry at the same time."
MAF_Final_Heydrich_Reforms:0 "Finalize the Heydrich Reforms"
MAF_Final_Heydrich_Reforms_desc:0 "With the proper investment, we can establish naval dockyards of our own, and contribute to any new naval arms race."
MAF_Sailing_With_Marine:0 "Sailing With the Kaiserliche Marine"
MAF_Sailing_With_Marine_desc:0 "Our vessels should not simply patrol local waters. We should send them sailing from Kiel to Tsingtau on exercises with the Kaiserliche Marine."
MAF_Back_To_Basics:0 "Back to the Basics"
MAF_Back_To_Basics_desc:0 "Our administration draws from over 50 years of experience on the Dark Continent. Undefeated against impossible odds in the Weltkrieg, we understand that Africa is very different from Europe, and are aware of our limitations. This is our strenght, not our weakness!"
MAF_Royal_Tours:0 "Royal Tours"
MAF_Royal_Tours_desc:0 "In Africa we mostly rule through local intermediaries, Kings and Chieftains whose rule we back with iron authority. We can use them to help modernise from the ground up, while also integrating them better into the empire by introducing them to the society of Kings, Dukes and other Royalty that makes up our larger empire."
MAF_Honorary_Officers:0 "Honorary Officers"
MAF_Honorary_Officers_desc:0 "The core of our authority are the Askari, who obey without question, and the local authorities who can effectively administrate our territories. We should blend the two by adopting Kings and Chieftains as honorary officers in our armed forces."
MAF_African_Studies:0 "Promote African Studies in Germany"
MAF_African_Studies_desc:0 "The official language of our administration is Swahilli, but there are few opportunities to learn it elsewhere, not to mention the hundreds of other native languages used in Africa. To have a steady supply of competent administrators, we should encourage German universities to train specialists in African languages and cultures."
MAF_Bezirk:0 "Bezirksleiterrecht"
MAF_Bezirk_desc:0 "Much of the law that ordinary Africans operate and face trial under is not German law, but local tribal laws, arbitrated by tribal leaders and elders. Rather than trying to stamp it out and flood our limited number of acceptable judges, lawyers and jurors, Rudolf Asmis has proposed we have teams of legal experts consult with the locals to put into writing and modernise their local laws."
MAF_Strategic_Reserve:0 "Strategic Resources Reserve"
MAF_Strategic_Reserve_desc:0 "In the last war, cut off from Germany, we had to improvise our own supplies. We found ways to manufacture torpedoes, artillery shells, dyes, liquors and foodstuffs out of practically nothing. We should perpetuate this tradition, and find ways to improvise the manufacture of goods if we are cut off from the Fatherland again."
MAF_Cash_Crops:0 "Cash Crops Exports"
MAF_Cash_Crops_desc:0 "It is no secret that the quest for exotic goods has always been a driver of imperialism. Many tropical crops can grow in the Sub-Saharan environment such as coffee and cocoa. We should focus on these rather than staples, importing food from Ukraine or East Prussia to make up for any imbalances."
MAF_East_Asian_Exports:0 "East Asian Exports"
MAF_East_Asian_Exports_desc:0 "We are only a part of Germany's vast colonial empire. We should make sure our trade doesn't only go to the metropole, but takes advantage of oppurtunities in the Orient."
MAF_Cottage_Industries:0 "Cottage Industries"
MAF_Cottage_Industries_desc:0 "It's strange to think, but even in the 20th century a great deal of work can be done by distributing work to the vast numbers of skilled Africans throughout the continent, many of them traditionally trained blacksmiths, in order to increase our production."
MAF_African_Army:0 "An African Army"
MAF_African_Army_desc:0 "We should never forget that our Askari are trained to secure and defend Africa. To this end, we require light infantry capable of operating in the brush and jungle on low supply."
MAF_Airforce_Infantry:0 "Establish the Air Mobile Infantry"
MAF_Airforce_Infantry_desc:0 "Ludwig von Bockholt, one of the main members of the DKG administration, has always been a daring innovator in air combat. His newest innovation: aerial deployment and resupply of full divisions."
MAF_Improve_Logistics:0 "Improve our Logistics"
MAF_Improve_Logistics_desc:0 "During the Weltkrieg, we required over 200,000 porters to supply a force of only 18,000 soldiers. This drained our food supplies and reduced our mobility to the rate at which humans can carry artillery. We cannot allow this to happen again."
MAF_Spirit_Vorbeck:0 "The Spirit of von Lettow-Vorbeck"
MAF_Spirit_Vorbeck_desc:0 "The most important lesson of the Weltkrieg cannot be found in any technical manual. It is exemplified in the sheer determination of General von Lettow-Vorbeck to continue fighting no matter how dire the situation might have appeared. In 1916, the Entente declared the situation in Africa over. In 1921 we were still standing, and still fighting. We never gave up, and we never will!"
MAF_Electronic_Project:0 "Electronic Intelligence Project"
MAF_Electronic_Project_desc:0 "Mittelafrika is not suited for a large navy, our shores are too large to protect and our industry would be better spent on other things. One such other thing is investment in electronics technology, which will give us the ability to project power from Africa and help our Fatherland through intelligence gathering."
MAF_Konigsburg_Gunners:0 "The Königsberg Gunners"
MAF_Konigsburg_Gunners_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg did not see much naval warfare in Africa, aside from some lake battles using improvised steamers. The key battle was the Battle of the Rufiji Delta, where the SMS Königsberg was severly damaged. However, the crew salvaged the guns before scuttling the ship, and served as artillery and infantry officers. Given such unique experiences, it is no wonder that some of our naval officers, such as Richard Wenig, have become experts in naval infatry tactics."
MAF_Naval_Aerial_Observation:0 "Naval Aerial Observation"
MAF_Naval_Aerial_Observation_desc:0 "Building on the strengh of standing astride many naval lanes, we should improve on our observation and interdiction ability with naval aircraft. Previously, these operations were conducted via dirigibles commanded by Commodore Bockholt, but advances in technology mean long range aircraft and flying boats are now the key. Conventional German naval aircraft are designed with the rather short ranges of the North Sea in mind. We must develop our facilities to modify planes to suit our own needs."
MAF_Our_Shipyards:0 "Our Own Shipyards"
MAF_Our_Shipyards_desc:0 "Our current policy of adapting and refitting outdated ships from the Kaiserliche Marine is both costly and ineffective. The ships we receive are too slow for modern vessels and are in frequent need of costly repairs. Instead of large, rusting cruisers, we should be focusing on state of the art destroyers and U-Boats to keep our operating costs low."
MAF_African_Landtag:0 "An African Landtag"
MAF_African_Landtag_desc:0 "Rather than all power residing in the Statthalter, we shall have two branches of legistlature, a Harrenhause made up of German noblemen and African kings, and a Abgeordnetenhaus, decided on by mainly white voters."
MAF_Reform_Schutztruppe:0 "Reform the Schutztruppe"
MAF_Reform_Schutztruppe_desc:0 "For too long our Schutztruppe have operated in military fashion despite not being part of the German military. Though they displayed outstanding bravery during the Weltkrieg, they are a police force, not an occupying army. It's time they acted like it."
MAF_Autonomous_Kingdoms:0 "Autonomous Kingdoms"
MAF_Autonomous_Kingdoms_desc:0 "Some areas of Africa are not suitable for white settlement, and our rule is particularly dependent on the good will of local rulers. Rather than trying to coordinate, we should grant them greater independence and autonomy, though naturally with ourselves as suzerain."
MAF_Restore_British_Selfrule:0 "Restore British Self Rule"
MAF_Restore_British_Selfrule_desc:0 "Integrating the British into our parliament is a nightmare. They do not have German citizenship, so they cannot vote, but the British have a deep love of parliamentarianism and shall resent their comparative privileges. We should instead restore some measure of self rule to these people, as part of our trusteeship to restore responsible government to these territories."
MAF_Hold_Elections:0 "Hold Elections"
MAF_Hold_Elections_desc:0 "It is time to hold Mittelafrika's first ever elections. They shall commence in about half a year, after all the parties have had time to campaign."
MAF_Deal_With_Europeans:0 "Deal with the Europeans"
MAF_Deal_With_Europeans_desc:0 "The Belgian and British citizens of our colony are very disproportionally influential, and it is time we deal with them one way or another."
MAF_Block_FW_Investment:0 "Block Flemish Investment"
MAF_Block_FW_Investment_desc:0 "For too long the Flemish and Walloons have played a disproportionately large role in the economy of our colony. We should take measures to ensure only German companies have access to these opportunities."
MAF_Seize_FW_Industries:0 "Seize Flemish Industries"
MAF_Seize_FW_Industries_desc:0 "Now that we've broken the power of Flemish-Walloon capital, their investors are eager to leave. We can seize upon any excuse we want to claim their industries as our own, or purchase them for a paltry sum."
MAF_Expel_Alien_Nationals:0 "Expel Alien Nationals"
MAF_Expel_Alien_Nationals_desc:0 "Unlike the British, the Flemish-Walloons rarely come here to settle. Most of them are technicians and skilled labourers who work here and then simply return to Europe to be later replaced by their fellow countrymen. Therefore, it is much easier to simply deport them back to Flanders-Wallonia."
MAF_Attract_Belgian_Investment:0 "Attract Flemish Investment"
MAF_Attract_Belgian_Investment_desc:0 "The Flemish-Walloons have been here long before us as a colonial power, and they've never really left. We have a comfortable and working relationship with numerous mining firms who have actually expanded beyond their original holdings in the Kongo. If we continue this policy, we can reap the benefits of their capital."
MAF_Grant_Cons_FW:0 "Flemish Resource Companies"
MAF_Grant_Cons_FW_desc:0 "By granting the Flemish-Walloon conglomerates autonomy and security rights over remote streches of the Congo, we can ensure a more disciplined workforce."
MAF_Intergrate_FW:0 "Integrate Flemish Officers"
MAF_Intergrate_FW_desc:0 "We fought against them in the Weltkrieg, but now the people of Flanders and Wallonia are our allies. Many of their officers have experience with commanding troops in Africa. We can use them."
MAF_Deal_With_Belgians:0 "Deal with the Flandro-Wallonians"
MAF_Deal_With_Belgians_desc:0 "Now that we have dealt with the Flandro-Wallonians and their ACC, it is time to make our arrangement with them permanent."
MAF_Disarm_Anglos:0 "Disarm the Anglo Security Forces"
MAF_Disarm_Anglos_desc:0 "Even before our arrival, the British populations of Kenya and Northern Rhodesia worked to ensure their security through 'rifle clubs', auxiliary police associations and paramillitaries. Participation rates have increased since our occupation, and so we must break up these groups if we are to truly rule the British territories."
MAF_Remove_Brit_Service:0 "Remove the British from the Civil Service"
MAF_Remove_Brit_Service_desc:0 "Positions in the former British colonies are often staffed by Swahilli-speaking Britons. We should endeavour to drive them out and fully Germanise the administration."
MAF_German_Education_Brits:0 "German Education for the Children"
MAF_German_Education_Brits_desc:0 "Growing off the base of our colony in East Africa, the official language of our administration is Swahilli, not German. This has allowed the British to maintain the use of their original languages by using Swahilli only when dealing with our administration. By instituting mandatory German education, we can Germanise the British population."
MAF_Support_Anglos:0 "Officially Support the Anglo Security Forces"
MAF_Support_Anglos_desc:0 "While some may see the militarisation of the British settlers as a threat, we see it as an opportunity. A large armed, conservative and white population can reinforce our rule and protect against native uprisings. We should grant our official blessing to these organisations."
MAF_Intergrate_Anglos:0 "Integrate the Anglo Security Forces"
MAF_Intergrate_Anglos_desc:0 "We can reduce discontent in our British trusteeships by offering their officers commisions in our forces at an equivalent rank. They will feel less like a subject population, and we get a wealth of well trained officers."
MAF_Canadian_Volunteers:0 "Canadian Volunteers"
MAF_Canadian_Volunteers_desc:0 "While we have integrated the British into our forces, some more patriotic members are eager to retake their home island. Since we're co-belligerents against the socialists, we should encourage them, and allow the training of a few divisions for frontline duty."
MAF_Deal_With_British:0 "Deal with the British"
MAF_Deal_With_British_desc:0 "Now that we have dealt with the British and their RVA, it is time to make our arrangement with them permanent."

MAF_Black_Monday_desc:0 "In light of this unprecedented economic crisis, we can expect all kinds of economic setbacks..."
MAF_Float_Mark:0 "Float the Mark"
MAF_Float_Mark_desc:0 "Since 1921, our colony has printed its own currency, the Afrikan Mark, which has been pegged to the German Mark. By allowing our currency to float, we can reduce the price of our exports, and return revenue to normal."
MAF_Fiscal_Austerity:0 "Fiscal Austerity"
MAF_Fiscal_Austerity_desc:0 "Times are tough and we must all tighten our belts, it is time to introduce a pay cut to all Mittelafrikan employees."
MAF_1937_Budget:0 "1937 Budget"

MAF_Napalm:0 "Defoliant and Napalm"
