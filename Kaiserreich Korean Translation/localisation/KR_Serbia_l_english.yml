### Event text ###
serbia.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Serbia"
serbia.1.d:0 "The assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand by a Serb nationalist in 1914 proved to be the catalyst that began the Weltkrieg. Despite expecting an easy campaign, Austrian forces only managed to occupy Serbia itself in late 1915, and because of the entrance of Bulgaria in the war. After the war Serbia's southern territories were handed over to Bulgaria, whilst the remainder was kept under Austrian occupation until 1926, when the Austrians were forced to withdraw their troops due to ethnic tensions elsewhere in the Empire.\n\nSince then Serbia has struggled to survive, keeping a low profile in light of the knowledge that she could not stand up to any sort of military attack. Over time however the government has become increasingly anti-Austrian and jingoistic, and knowing that they could not hope to defeat Austria they have instead turned their attentions southwards, towards the lands occupied by Bulgaria. Several diplomatic talks have already been conducted with the Romanian and Greek governments with a view to undermining Bulgarian hegemony in the region, and some say talk of a formal alliance is not far off.\n\nCan Serbia successfully steer a course to triumph in the 'Bulgarian Matter'? And if so, can she finally defeat the old enemy Austria, and realise her dream of a pan-Slavic Union?"
