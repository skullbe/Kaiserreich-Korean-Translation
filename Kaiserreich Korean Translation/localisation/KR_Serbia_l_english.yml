serbia.1.d:0 "1914년 세르비아 민족주의자에 의한 페르디난트 대공의 암살은 세계대전을 시작하는 촉매가 되었습니다. 쉬운 전역을 기대했지만 오스트리아 군은 1915년 말에 불가리아 군의 참여 이후에야 세르비아를 점령할 수 있었습니다. 전후, 세르비아의 남쪽 지역은 불가리아에 넘겨졌고 나머지는 1926년까지 오스트리아 치하에 있다가 제국 전역의 민족적 갈등때문에 오스트리아가 군대를 후퇴시켰습니다.\n\n그 이후로 세르비아는 생존하기 위해 투쟁해 왔고 어떠한 군사적 공격도 견뎌낼 수 없다는 점을 고려하여 저자세를 유지했습니다. 하지만 시간이 갈 수록 정부는 반 오스트리아 적으로, 호전적으로 되어갔고 오스트리아를 무찌를 희망이 없다고 느끼자 대신 남쪽으로 눈을 돌려 불가리아에 점유당한 땅에 주목했습니다. 외교적 논의가 지역 내 불가리아 패권주의를 약화시키고자 하는 루마니아와 그리스 정부 사이에서 논의되었고 혹자는 공식적 동맹이 멀지 않았다고들 합니다.\n\n세르비아가 '불가리아 문제'에 대해 승리하는 길로 나갈 수 있을까요? 만약 그렇게 된다면 최종적으로 옛 적 오스트리아를 무찌르고 범 슬라브 연방의 꿈을 실현할 수 있을까요?"
