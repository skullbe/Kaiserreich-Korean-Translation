newengland.1.t:0 "The Occupation of New England"
newengland.1.d:0 "The outbreak of civil war has left the New England region lightly defended and vulnerable to occupation. If we strike first, we could close a weak point on our eastern flank and strengthen our position against any invasion from a hostile American power. All but abandoned by their government, we anticipate our New England cousins will welcome our intervention."
newengland.1.a:0 "Seize New England!"
newengland.1.b:0 "It is too risky."

newengland.2.t:0 "Canada seizes New England"

newengland.5.t:0 "Our own America"
newengland.5.d:0 "We have taken control of the region of America known as New England. Now that we have done so, a number of ministers have met with leaders from those states to set up a provisional government in America. They would be our own America and should we fight the rest of America, we have our own ally and one that we can influence. Of course, some also think we should just occupy the land."

Unfortunately, not many people both in and out of the states in New England believe that we are the true and legitimate America, and we must rectify this problem. "
newengland.6.a:0 "Don't tread on me!"

newengland.7.t:0 "America is Reunited"

By the end of the devastation over 57,000 homes were destroyed or damaged and road networks all across the New England region lay in tatters with projections estimating that it would take us months or even years just to re-open them to traffic."
