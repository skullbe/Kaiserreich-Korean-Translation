NEE_Defence_of_New_England_desc:0 "Our worst fears have come to be as the American Civil War is tearing up the nation from the coasts on the Pacific to the Texan oilfields to the smoking factories of the Great Lakes. We have only succeeded in escaping from the terror by the grace of the British Empire but even our future looks troubled as it is only a matter of time before the ideologically clashing blocs of the South look Northwards, ready to take back what they see as their rightful land.\n\nIt is for them that we must be prepared and defence systems must be created from the Hudson River to the streets of Boston. We may look weak on paper, but it will take every last drop of real American blood to take us down and forever end the American Dream."

NEE_air_defence_of_the_territory_desc:0 "Modern War has shown the value of an airforce and the massive destruction it can cause upon the armies of old. Whilst we are desperately trying to keep in the air race, our industrial facilities are far smaller than those of our enemies which has prompted High Command to focus instead on the creation of an elaborate Anti-Air defence system capable of nullifying the air superiority of our opponents."

NEE_Sway_Public_Opinion_desc:0 "We may have declared ourselves the only legitimate successor to the United States of America but both abroad and within New England many people are not convinced by our rhetoric.

NEE_presidential_goodwill_tour:0 "Hold a Presidential Good-Will Tour"
NEE_presidential_goodwill_tour_desc:0 "Even as our propaganda ministry works around the clock, the man on the street remains unconvinced that actual power is wielded in Boston and sees the "President" as nothing more but a Canadian sock puppet happily following all orders from Ottawa. By touring the president and the elected cabinet around the New English states and by doing shaking some hands and kissing some babies we hope to further convince the people that their real president and leader is very well [NEE.GetLeader]"

NEE_bribe_foreign_press:0 ""Motivate" Foreign Press"
NEE_bribe_foreign_press_desc:0 "Journalists from all sides of the world keep having this annoying habit of reporting news within our nation as matters of the "New English" state with socialist-aligned papers even going so far as calling us the Canadian Province of New England. This will no longer do for we will not be trifled with and they shall soon recognise that the only true American nation is ours. For now, however we'll have to be content with sliding some money towards the largest troublemakers and politely requesting that they call us the United States of America."

NEE_foreign_representation:0 "Increase our Foreign Representation in R&D"
NEE_foreign_representation_desc:0 "The war may be raging harder than ever before but the scientists of America are still working in the labs and engineering facilities of the Ivy League universities boosting the imago of the United States.

newengland.40.d:0 "What was first considered a non-issue, the Yankee Clipper Hurricane arrived on Long Island September 21st and would only a few hours later turn out to be largest Hurricane to set foot in New England since the Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635.\n\nMoving North from Long Island to Connecticut, Rhode Island and up through Vermont the storm cost the lives of close to 700 people. By the end of the devastation over 57,000 homes were destroyed or damaged and road networks all across the New England region lay in tatters with projections estimating that it would take us months or even years just to re-open them to traffic."
newengland.40.a:0 "God save us all"

newengland.41.t:0 "Road integration with Canada?"
newengland.41.d:0 "As we continue building up our economy and expanding the road network, the question arose of which direction we should drive on. While the custom in America has always been to drive on the right Canada has, since the British revolution in 1925, driven on the left.\n\nSome political leaders have suggested that we switch to driving on the Left in an attempt to better integrate our road network into the Canadian one whilst others of course wish to stay driving on the right to further amplify that New England is not a British Dominion."

This is the first time that a reigning British monarch has visited Boston in its entire history. As to be expected large jubilant crowds of New Englanders have come out to catch a sight of the King and Queen of the British Empire. The visit was more then just seeing the sites of the sites for they also came to discuss politics with the various leaders of note in New England."
newengland.42.a:0 "Welcome to Boston!"

### Underground Railroad ###
newengland.50.t:0 "The Underground Railroad"
newengland.50.d:0 "Established in the 1700s, the first Underground Railroad served as a network of secret routes with as purpose to clandestinely transport Afro-American slaves from the Thirteen Colonies into Canada where slavery was already abolished.\n\nWith the American Civil War tearing apart households across the Americans and ideological strive leading to the forced expulsion or sometimes even massacre of Americans, our government has reignited the old "Railroad" and has with the aid of locals on both sides of the border re-established the network with the hopes of safely transporting refugees to our little nation."

#CSA
newengland.51.t:0 "The Lake Erie Migration Crisis"
newengland.51.d:0 "The war has only been raging for a few weeks now as federalists and syndicalists fight it out around the Great Lakes. As comrade shoots comrade and the battlelines shift in both directions, one can not forget the tremendous loss of civilian life.\n\nOften caught in the midst of battle, decimated in bombing raids or executed by fanatics of either side, these people have been fleeing en-masse from the fighting towards our nation. As the land route is becoming more dangerous by the day, vast swathes of shaky tubs have been spotted on Lake Erie in a desperate attempt to reach our peaceful sanctuary. The condition of these rafts is often so dire that many don't even make it across the border, let alone into our safe hands. Relief organisations such as United America and the Red Cross have flocked to the coastline of the lake to help those that survive the perilous journey, often undertaken under cover of the night. They now ask that the government provides them with more means to rescue those coming across and to sweep our side of the lake for survivors.\n\nPragmatists in the Army however have seen an opportunity in this Great Migration to smuggle weaponry and equipment from the CSA into our hands. They propose that we send covert agents to Detroit and Cleveland who will then smuggle the goods on the refugee rafts towards our patrol boats."
newengland.51.a:0 "Allow covert operatives to establish a base on Pelee Island"
newengland.51.b:0 "We can not put the lives of innocents in danger with our schemes!"

newengland.52.t:0 "Successful Smuggling Operation on Lake Erie"
newengland.52.d:0 "Tucked away beneath sheets of linen and between the clothes of refugees, our covert operatives on the syndicalist side of Lake Erie have been able to successfully smuggle small arms, munition, medical supplies. Even heavier equipment such as artillery shells and dismantled mortars have been carried across by efforts of our, American, people being nothing short of heroic. Thus far the Syndies suspect nothing but it would seem only natural that one day our luck will run out..."
newengland.52.a:0 "Piece by piece we pick away at the syndicalist carcass"

newengland.53.t:0 "Smugglers apprehended!"
newengland.53.d:0 "Our good fortune couldn't last and yesterday was once again further proof of this. Although nothing seemed out of the ordinary on the smuggler boats, a slight deviation on the schedule of the Cleveland harbour patrol caught our operatives in the midst of the crime. Words could not explain why there were dozens of ammo chests and carabines on an unmarked vessel and it didn't take long until the boat was brought back to shore and our agents locked behind bars."
newengland.53.a:0 "Change the course of the routes, we can not stop the operation!"
newengland.53.b:0 "It's too risky, we should focus on the refugee program"

newengland.54.t:0 ""Jack" the Doberman"
newengland.54.d:0 "As man falls back into his usual routine of killing his neighbours, the animal world is not spared from the violence either. A happy story however emerged from Connecticut where a young Doberman, ironically enough named Jack, was able to stop syndicalist agents from blowing up a bomb in Hartford.\n\nThe dog was training in cooperation with the Connecticut National Guard when his patrol spotted the syndicalists who promptly tried to escape from capture. With the courage of a true American, the little dog immediately ran after them and pulled one of the two men down leading to his capture. This man later turned out to be none other than Paul Rashford, a target long sought after by the Hartford Police Department for his implication in the syndicalist riots only a few months earlier and who seems to have established a whole network of syndicalist operatives in Connecticut.\n\nWhilst his capture by no means marks the end of the socialist threat in the state, "Jack" has dealt a heavy blow to their leadership."
newengland.54.a:0 "We express our thanks to this good boy!"

newengland.55.t:0 "Refugees from the CSA"
newengland.55.d:0 "The horrors of war keep raging in the Combined Syndicates of America and the large migratory wave from theirs into our territory seems to know no end. Just as last month, the Underground Railroad has once again led to the successful transfer of thousands of these war refugees into our Safe Harbour."
newengland.55.a:0 "Let us pray the violence will end soon"

newengland.56.a:0 "Welcome to New England!"

newengland.57.t:0 "Pelley asserts control in the AUS"
newengland.57.d:0 "It came as no surprise to the people of America that Huey Long served only as a tool for the far more dangerous Pelley. Today the power struggle within the leadership of the Union State finally came to a head as Pelley himself has officially been sworn in as President and has already started to implement his policies of far-reaching racism and his wishes to achieve a White Christian Nation.\n\nIt goes without saying that the response to these events in the Black Belt has been far from welcoming as hundreds of thousands of Afro-American citizens now fear for their future and look North to us in the hopes of finding a safe haven far away from Pelley’s cronies."
newengland.57.a:0 "We have no place for them either!"
newengland.57.b:0 "Install strict refugee quotas and only allow a select few in"
newengland.57.c:0 "In Boston one is not discriminated for the colour of his skin!"

newengland.58.t:0 "Unchecked Migration"
newengland.58.d:0 "What started as a few hundred, rapidly became tens of thousands as Pelley’s anti-black policy has scared the Afro-American citizens northwards into our territory. Border guards are unable to keep up with the increasing amount of refugees and government institutions and relief organisations are struggling to provide shelter and food to those who have lost their home. We need to step in and do so now or we will risk our own nation collapsing under the weight of these people who more often than not have used all their resources to make it to our border.\n\nA hard choice will have to be made between restricting the amount of refugees coming and thus leaving them at the mercy of Pelley’s regime in the South or to let them all freely cross the border and risk straining our own nation. Relief organisations like United America have already denounced certain political figures who have spoken out against the unchecked migration but even they are now realizing that resources are rapidly decreasing, and the flood keeps increasing."
newengland.58.a:0 "Close the Border!"

A single person to represent the corpus of hundreds of artists against the tide of film and popular music as an art form. The New England congress has decided to create this title along with a re-consecration of the Boston Athenæum as the temporary Library of Congress. The top candidate in the congressional poll is Robert Frost, who exhibits a distinctly New England mastery of modernist poetry. Public polls, however, has shown favor for the pulp fiction writer H.P Lovecraft. Lovecraft has written in the papers that he would accept this award, but not appear in public for the ceremony. The Library of Congress is in a bind."

newengland.60.d:0 "The private life of President Winant is not the proper subject of newspaper gossip, but after today, it is a public issue. President Winant's minders found a loaded gun in his bedroom tonight, and after a panic determined their was no intended assassin. President Winant confessed to his minders that his secret affair with Sarah Churchill ended, and he is distraught over the potential political fallout for indiscretions with a major Canadian politician's daughter. Fortunately, Winston Churchill was very gently notified, and forgave President Winant in person. Winant has decided to take a few days break to recuperate mentally."

newengland.61.d:0 "Long before his career in politics, Peter Gerry was a student at Harvard. There, he was tutored by Canadian Deputy Minister of Labor William Lyon King. These lessons had a major impact on Gerry.  Now, King is a major Liberal politician whose allies stateside are the Republicans and the Liberals. As a President, Gerry has talked with his advisors about crossing the party line to help his old mentor. This would invariably debase the Democrats, and aid the Liberals in America. "

newengland.62.d:0 "A massive fire erupted in the popular Boston nightclub, Cocoanut Grove, leaving almost 500 people dead. Among the victims are several high ranking American immigrants, and the uproar searching for an answer has raced the highest halls of power. It appears that several mid-level Democratic party politicians had taken bribes earlier this month before an inspection. This inspection was independently determined to be insufficient, and the public prosecutor is preparing a case aledging massive conspiracy. This has rocked public support for Democrats across New England."

newengland.63.d:0 "Since the abandoning of New York City to the militant unions, Nelson has sought to recover whatever he can from his prized Rockefeller Center. It appears now, that most of the artwork installed in the skyscraper is now for sale, which Nelson took advantage of. When these relics of a peaceful America arrived, we were all ashamed to find them defaced. It appears Diego Rivera, whose murals were rejected for installation, took it upon himself to replace images of Zeus with Marx. Among several other mythological heroes were all strategically replaced with their respective socialist myth-men. These priceless works of art are ruined."

As it is still necessary for Senators to recommend prospective young men, the decrease from 100 new cadets to just 14. It has been suggested that we allow Canadian politicians to recommend their young men to West Point. We are in dire need of new officers, and yet at the same time, this time honored tradition ensures that this institution isn't used by foreign powers, much less the Crown."

newengland.70.d:0 "The "Freedom Fliers" initiative has been activated by our government but there is still much discussion about the content of the dropped messages as the right message could wreak havoc behind their lines but the wrong message could further bolster their resolve.\n\nWhether to strike the civilian population or the armed forces directly also remains a topic for debate as some have argued that the enemy homefront would be more susceptible to our message but a direct strike on their armed forces could lead to a more direct effect."

newengland.71.t:0 "The Tale of Private Bob "Daredevil" Rogers"
newengland.71.d:0 "Private Bob had always been a well-known name in the corps of the Freedom Fliers but it was his recent heroic actions above syndicalist territory that earned him his nickname "Daredevil".\n\nSent out with 5 other members of his squadron, he and his compatriots got surprised by a CSA anti air installation that had been placed there after rumours of incursions into their air zone. Bad intel on our part ultimately led to disaster as the entire group of planes was shredded to pieces with only Private Bob and one of his crew mates surviving the crash. Landing deep behind enemy lines and with no way to reach our own positions, the two men took it upon themselves to perform a series of guerilla actions in the region, achieving critical success in hindering syndicalist supply lines and successfully forcing their command to deploy further troops to the region.\n\nTheir success would however not continue much longer as an attempt to recruit possible sympathizers amidst the civilian population backfired and a setup orchestrated to finally kill the two men led to the death of Bobs fellow soldier and the loss of his right ear.\n\nNow alone, out of ammunition and still with no way to return to base, Bob traveled all the way North to Lake Erie whilst always staying one step ahead of the syndicalist agents tracking him down.\n\nEmbarking with 50 refugees on a shaky vessel, Bob finally made it back into New York last week. Having been stuck alone with no contact deep behind enemy lines, it took the brave man 50 days to make his way back into our country leaving a trail of sabotage in his wake. Although granted leave by his commanding officers to recover from his adventure, Bob has reportedly already signed up for the next flight claiming that he would do it all over again for his beloved nation."

newengland.72.t:0 "Further Expansion of the "Freedom Fliers""
newengland.72.d:0 "Recent successes with the Corps have prompted many to question whether the planes should also be used to perform air drops behind enemy lines to supply the resistance cells with weapons and further equipment. Some have argued however that this deviates too far from the original peaceful mission of the Freedom Fliers and that the extra equipment and manpower necessary for the operations might very well be better spend elsewhere."

We have thus far been unable to stop them and there isn't even an answer as to which faction the saboteurs adhere."
