#Entente Allies
NEE_entente_allies:0 "Supporting the Entente"
NEE_entente_allies_desc:0 "Our ties to Canada means we are a member of the Entente - whether we like it or not. The British have a great deal of experience and technology, however, which we can use to considerable advantage - though the more we do so, the more we lose legitimacy as a separate and distinct government."

#Reclaiming America
NEE_reclaiming_america:0 "Reclaiming America"
NEE_reclaiming_america_desc:0 "The Liberty Bell still rings in Boston even as other parts of our fair nation have torn themselves Asunder. Ever since the Canadian intervention which created our provisional government, we have hoped for democracy to win out in the civil war. If that is not the case, then we must steel ourselves to carry the torch for freedom, as the last vestige of democratic America."

NEE_claim_usa_territory:0 "Claim the Mantle of Free America"

#Defence Stratagem A
NEE_Defence_of_New_England:0 "Defence Stratagem A"
NEE_Defence_of_New_England_desc:0 "Our worst fears have come to be as the American Civil War is tearing up the nation from the coasts on the Pacific to the Texan oilfields to the smoking factories of the Great Lakes. We have only succeeded in escaping from the terror by the grace of the British Empire but even our future looks troubled as it is only a matter of time before the ideologically clashing blocs of the South look Northwards, ready to take back what they see as their rightful land.\n\nIt is for them that we must be prepared and defence systems must be created from the Hudson River to the streets of Boston. We may look weak on paper, but it will take every last drop of real American blood to take us down."

NEE_air_defence_of_the_territory:0 "Deploy the Anti-Air Defence System"
NEE_air_defence_of_the_territory_desc:0 "Modern War has shown the value of an airforce and the massive destruction it can cause upon the armies of old. Whilst we are desperately trying to keep in the air race, our industrial facilities are far smaller than those of our enemies which has prompted High Command to focus instead on the creation of an elaborate Anti-Air defence system capable of nullifying the air superiority of our opponents."

NEE_hudson_line:0 "Fortify the Hudson Line"
NEE_hudson_line_desc:0 "Flowing down towards the great city of New York, the Hudson river is of great value to any would be defender. Placing §YBunkers§! on its river banks may prove to be of great value in stopping the Southern threat."

NEE_connecticut_line:0 "Fall back to the Connecticut River"
NEE_connecticut_line_desc:0 "Whilst our main defence line lies on the Hudson river, one must always prepare for the unforeseen and as such we should consider creating a line of equal strength behind the Connecticut River. They may have gotten the better of us at the Hudson, but their offence stops here!"

NEE_boston_last_stand:0 "Our Last Stand"
NEE_boston_last_stand_desc:0 "The rivers have been breached and enemy troops are flooding the New Englander countryside. Boston still stands yet general evacuation of its civilian population has already been decreed. "It may seem that the war is turning against us, but the men and women of Boston shall not go gently into the night. We are the last bastion of American democracy; their last hope and it is here that this madness stops!""
NEE_last_stand_tt:0 "3 Divisions of §GNew Englander Volunteers§! will spawn in §YBoston§! to defend the city\n"

#Sway Public Opinion
NEE_Sway_Public_Opinion:0 "Establishing Legitimacy"
NEE_Sway_Public_Opinion_desc:0 "We are a government that has been put into place by a foreign power - and thus many are keen to disregard our right to exist, or to call us traitors for not weighing in on the civil war raging in the rest of the nation. We must combat the opinion that we serve British interests rather than American citizens, and that involves changing attitudes at home. Failure to do so means the eventual dissolution of our government once the civil war is finished - or worse.\n\nCurrent Legitimacy :  §G[?NEE.NEE_legitimacy]§!"

NEE_national_propaganda_campaign:0 "Organise a Propaganda Campaign"
NEE_national_propaganda_campaign_desc:0 "Billboards, Radio Commercials, Newspaper Ads and much more, all will be pushed down the people’s throats in the hopes of conveying our message."

NEE_presidential_goodwill_tour:0 "Hold a Presidential Goodwill Tour"
NEE_presidential_goodwill_tour_desc:0 "Even as our propaganda ministry works around the clock, the man on the street remains unconvinced that actual power is wielded in Boston and sees the "president" as nothing more than a Canadian sock puppet happily following all orders from Ottawa. By touring the president and the elected cabinet around New England we hope to further convince the people that their real president and leader is very much [NEE.GetLeader]"

NEE_bribe_foreign_press:0 "'Motivate' the Foreign Press"
NEE_bribe_foreign_press_desc:0 "Journalists from all sides of the world keep having this annoying habit of reporting news within our nation as matters of the 'New Englander' state with socialist-aligned papers even going so far as calling us the Canadian Province of New England. This will no longer do for we will not be trifled with and they shall soon recognise that the only true American nation is ours. For now, however we'll have to be content with sliding some money towards the largest troublemakers and politely requesting that they call us the United States of America."

NEE_foreign_representation:0 "Increase Foreign Representation in R&D"
NEE_foreign_representation_desc:0 "The war may be raging harder than ever before but American scientists are still working in the labs and engineering facilities of the Ivy League universities. Let's make it clear that [Root.GetNameDef] has the wherewithal to innovate and stand on its own among the world leaders."

NEE_labour_relation_act:0 "Pass the Labour Relation Act"
NEE_labour_relation_act_desc:0 "A key source of the chaos to the south was the unmitigated exploitation of the working class by the elite. We need to avoid this occurring here by protecting workers' rights"

#Freedom Fliers
NEE_Dropping_Propaganda:0 "The 'Freedom Fliers'"
NEE_Dropping_Propaganda_desc:0 "The airplane has not only revolutionised the way we travel, transport goods or even wage warfare but also the ways with which we can spread our messages. Through the use of balloons, bombers and even just your regular fighter, the Freedom Fliers initiative has been tasked with flying deep over enemy territory to wage not the physical but the psychological war hoping to disrupt the minds of those that may not fully be on board with the nation they are fighting for."

NEE_Choosing_our_Propaganda:0 "Choosing our Message"
NEE_Choosing_our_Propaganda_desc:0 "Even though there is an agreement that the Freedom Fliers should depart for the skies, dispute still rules in the ministry of propaganda as the search for the 'perfect' message knows no end and designers are sent back to the drawing board."

#Liberty Ship Project
NEE_Liberty_Ship_Program:0 "Liberty Ship Program"
NEE_Liberty_Ship_Program_desc:0 "With war on the European continent inevitable and with the Ententes ambitions to execute the largest naval operation in the history of mankind, the dockyards of New England are working overtime to meet the increasing needs of the alliance. To further boost our output, a centralised construction scheme has been created by the government to guide the further expansion of these shipyards."

newengland.40.d:0 "처음으로 이목을 끌었던 양키 클리퍼 허리케인은 9월 21일 롱아일랜드에 상륙하고 불과 몇 시간 후 1635년 이후 뉴잉글랜드에 상륙한 가장 큰 허리케인으로 판명되었습니다.\n\n롱아일랜드에서 로드아일랜드 코네티컷, 버몬트까지 허리케인으로 인해 700여명의 사망자가 발생했습니다. 57,000채의 가옥이 반파되거나 완파되었고 뉴잉글랜드 전역에 걸친 거미줄같은 도로망을 복구하는데 몇달 혹은 몇년이 걸릴것으로 예상됩니다."
newengland.40.a:0 "신이여 우리를 보우하소서"

newengland.41.t:0 "캐나다와의 도로 연결?"
newengland.41.d:0 "우리가 계속해서 경제를 발전시키고 도로망을 확장함에 따라, 우리가 어느 방향으로 나아가야 하는지에 대한 의문이 제기되었습니다. 미국의 관습은 항상 우측통행이었지만, 1925년 영국 혁명 이후로 캐나다는 좌측통행을 도입했습니다.\n\n일부 정치인들은 우리의 도로망을 캐나다와 더 잘 통합하기 위한 시도로 좌측통행을 제안했지만, 다른 사람들은 우리는 영국이 우리의 주인이 아니라는 것을 상기시키기 위해 우측통행을 요구합니다."
newengland.41.a:0 "우리는 영국식 모델을 도입할 것이다"
newengland.41.b:0 "미국 자동차는 자유의 편에서 달린다!"

newengland.42.t:0 "영국 왕실의 뉴잉글랜드 방문"
newengland.42.d:0 "에드웓 8세와 오클레앙의 부인 이사벨이 뉴잉글랜드와 캐나다간의 관계 개선을 위해 오늘 보스턴에 도착했습니다. 재임 중인 영국 국왕이 보스턴을 방문한것은 역사상 처음 있는 일입니다. 예상한대로, 대영제국의 왕과 여왕을 보기 위해 많은 군중들이 운집했습니다. 또 왕은 뉴잉글랜드의 여러 지도자들과 정치를 논의하기 위해 온 것으로도 알려져 있습니다."
newengland.42.a:0 "보스턴에 오신걸 환영합니다!"

### Underground Railroad ###
newengland.50.t:0 "지하철"
newengland.50.d:0 "1700년대에 설립된 최초의 지하철은 아프리카계 미국인 노예들을 13개 식민지로부터 이미 노예제도가 폐지된 캐나다로 비밀리에 탈출시키기 위한 비밀노선망의 역할을 했습니다.\n\n미국 남북전쟁이 미국 전역을 분열시키고 강제 추방 또는 학살로 이어지는 이념적 투쟁으로 인해, 우리 정부는 옛 '철도'를 재편성했고, 안전하게 그들을 수송하기 위해 국경 양쪽 주민들의 도움으로 비밀노선망을 다시 구축했습니다. 뉴잉글랜드를 위하여!"
newengland.50.a:0 "하지만 우리가 할 수 있는 일은 이정도 뿐이지..."

#CSA
newengland.51.t:0 "The Lake Erie Migration Crisis"
newengland.51.d:0 "The war has only been raging for a few weeks now as federalists and syndicalists fight it out around the Great Lakes. As comrade shoots comrade and the battlelines shift in both directions, one can not forget the tremendous loss of civilian life.\n\nOften caught in the midst of battle, decimated in bombing raids or executed by fanatics of either side, these people have been fleeing en-masse from the fighting towards our nation. As the land route is becoming more dangerous by the day, vast swathes of shaky tubs have been spotted on Lake Erie in a desperate attempt to reach our peaceful sanctuary. The condition of these rafts is often so dire that many don't even make it across the border, let alone into our safe hands. Relief organisations such as United America and the Red Cross have flocked to the coastline of the lake to help those that survive the perilous journey, often undertaken under cover of the night. They now ask that the government provides them with more means to rescue those coming across and to sweep our side of the lake for survivors.\n\nPragmatists in the Army however have seen an opportunity in this Great Migration to smuggle weaponry and equipment from the CSA into our hands. They propose that we send covert agents to Detroit and Cleveland who will then smuggle the goods on the refugee rafts towards our patrol boats."
newengland.51.a:0 "Allow covert operatives to establish a base on Pelee Island"
newengland.51.b:0 "We can not put the lives of innocents in danger with our schemes!"

newengland.52.t:0 "Successful Smuggling Operation on Lake Erie"
newengland.52.d:0 "Tucked away beneath sheets of linen and between the clothes of refugees, our covert operatives on the syndicalist side of Lake Erie have been able to successfully smuggle small arms, munition, medical supplies. Even heavier equipment such as artillery shells and dismantled mortars have been carried across by efforts of our, American, people being nothing short of heroic. Thus far the Syndies suspect nothing but it would seem only natural that one day our luck will run out..."
newengland.52.a:0 "Piece by piece we pick away at the syndicalist carcass"

newengland.53.t:0 "Smugglers apprehended!"
newengland.53.d:0 "Our good fortune couldn't last and yesterday was once again further proof of this. Although nothing seemed out of the ordinary on the smuggler boats, a slight deviation on the schedule of the Cleveland harbour patrol caught our operatives in the midst of the crime. Words could not explain why there were dozens of ammo chests and carabines on an unmarked vessel and it didn't take long until the boat was brought back to shore and our agents locked behind bars."
newengland.53.a:0 "Change the course of the routes, we can not stop the operation!"
newengland.53.b:0 "It's too risky, we should focus on the refugee program"

newengland.54.t:0 ""Jack" the Doberman"
newengland.54.d:0 "As man falls back into his usual routine of killing his neighbours, the animal world is not spared from the violence either. A happy story however emerged from Connecticut where a young Doberman, ironically enough named Jack, was able to stop syndicalist agents from blowing up a bomb in Hartford.\n\nThe dog was training in cooperation with the Connecticut National Guard when his patrol spotted the syndicalists who promptly tried to escape from capture. With the courage of a true American, the little dog immediately ran after them and pulled one of the two men down leading to his capture. This man later turned out to be none other than Paul Rashford, a target long sought after by the Hartford Police Department for his implication in the syndicalist riots only a few months earlier and who seems to have established a whole network of syndicalist operatives in Connecticut.\n\nWhilst his capture by no means marks the end of the socialist threat in the state, 'Jack' has dealt a heavy blow to their leadership."
newengland.54.a:0 "We express our thanks to this good boy!"

newengland.55.t:0 "Refugees from the CSA"
newengland.55.d:0 "The horrors of war keep raging in the Combined Syndicates of America and the large migratory wave from theirs into our territory seems to know no end. Just as last month, the Underground Railroad has once again led to the successful transfer of thousands of these war refugees into our Safe Harbour."
newengland.55.a:0 "Let us pray the violence will end soon"

#TEX
newengland.56.t:0 "Refugees from the AUS"
newengland.56.d:0 "Although the journey is full of peril and even though bandits and/or criminals stalk the trails from the deep South all the way to Connecticut, thousands still depart on the journey hoping that they may find peace and a protector in our nation."
newengland.56.a:0 "Welcome to New England!"

newengland.57.t:0 "Pelley asserts control in the AUS"
newengland.57.d:0 "It came as no surprise to the people of America that Huey Long served only as a tool for the far more dangerous Pelley. Today the power struggle within the leadership of the Union State finally came to a head as Pelley himself has officially been sworn in as President and has already started to implement his policies of far-reaching racism and his wishes to achieve a White Christian Nation.\n\nIt goes without saying that the response to these events in the Black Belt has been far from welcoming as hundreds of thousands of Afro-American citizens now fear for their future and look North to us in the hopes of finding a safe haven far away from Pelley’s cronies."
newengland.57.a:0 "We have no place for them either!"
newengland.57.b:0 "Install strict refugee quotas and only allow a select few in"
newengland.57.c:0 "In Boston one is not discriminated for the colour of his skin!"

newengland.58.t:0 "Unchecked Migration"
newengland.58.d:0 "What started as a few hundred, rapidly became tens of thousands as Pelley’s anti-black policy has scared the Afro-American citizens northwards into our territory. Border guards are unable to keep up with the increasing amount of refugees and government institutions and relief organisations are struggling to provide shelter and food to those who have lost their home. We need to step in and do so now or we will risk our own nation collapsing under the weight of these people who more often than not have used all their resources to make it to our border.\n\nA hard choice will have to be made between restricting the amount of refugees coming and thus leaving them at the mercy of Pelley’s regime in the South or to let them all freely cross the border and risk straining our own nation. Relief organisations like United America have already denounced certain political figures who have spoken out against the unchecked migration but even they are now realizing that resources are rapidly decreasing, and the flood keeps increasing."
newengland.58.a:0 "Close the Border!"
newengland.58.b:0 "We are the only hope these people have, let them in!"

newengland.59.t:0 "Appointing the New England Poet laureate"
newengland.59.d:0 "The position of Poet laureate has been discussed within state politics for a few years now. A single person to represent the corpus of hundreds of artists against the tide of film and popular music as an art form. The New England congress has decided to create this title along with a re-consecration of the Boston Athenæum as the temporary Library of Congress. The top candidate in the congressional poll is Robert Frost, who exhibits a distinctly New England mastery of modernist poetry. Public polls, however, has shown favor for the pulp fiction writer H.P Lovecraft. Lovecraft has written in the papers that he would accept this award, but not appear in public for the ceremony. The Library of Congress is in a bind."
newengland.59.a:0 "Robert Frost, Modernist Master"
newengland.59.b:0 "H.P Lovecraft, the master of horror"

newengland.60.t:0 "Intervention for John Winant"
newengland.60.d:0 "The private life of President Winant is not the proper subject of newspaper gossip, but after today, it is a public issue. President Winant's minders found a loaded gun in his bedroom tonight, and after a panic determined their was no intended assassin. President Winant confessed to his minders that his secret affair with Sarah Churchill ended, and he is distraught over the potential political fallout for indiscretions with a major Canadian politician's daughter. Fortunately, Winston Churchill was very gently notified, and forgave President Winant in person. Winant has decided to take a few days break to recuperate mentally."
newengland.60.a:0 "He just need a few days off"

newengland.61.t:0 "Gerry Campaigns for Mackenzie King"
newengland.61.d:0 "Long before his career in politics, Peter Gerry was a student at Harvard. There, he was tutored by Canadian Deputy Minister of Labor William Lyon King. These lessons had a major impact on Gerry.  Now, King is a major Liberal politician whose allies stateside are the Republicans and the Liberals. As a President, Gerry has talked with his advisors about crossing the party line to help his old mentor. This would invariably debase the Democrats, and aid the Liberals in America. "
newengland.61.a:0 "Don't cross party lines!"
newengland.61.b:0 "Gerry can campaign as he pleases"

newengland.62.t:0 "Cocoanut Grove fire traced back to Tobin"
newengland.62.d:0 "A massive fire erupted in the popular Boston nightclub, Cocoanut Grove, leaving almost 500 people dead. Among the victims are several high ranking American immigrants, and the uproar searching for an answer has raced the highest halls of power. It appears that several mid-level Democratic party politicians had taken bribes earlier this month before an inspection. This inspection was independently determined to be insufficient, and the public prosecutor is preparing a case aledging massive conspiracy. This has rocked public support for Democrats across New England."
newengland.62.a:0 "A shame upon the city"

newengland.63.t:0 "Rockefeller Center artifacts recovered, some defaced"
newengland.63.d:0 "Since the abandoning of New York City to the militant unions, Nelson has sought to recover whatever he can from his prized Rockefeller Center. It appears now, that most of the artwork installed in the skyscraper is now for sale, which Nelson took advantage of. When these relics of a peaceful America arrived, we were all ashamed to find them defaced. It appears Diego Rivera, whose murals were rejected for installation, took it upon himself to replace images of Zeus with Marx. Among several other mythological heroes were all strategically replaced with their respective socialist myth-men. These priceless works of art are ruined."
newengland.63.a:0 "I'll get you Rivera, someday!"

newengland.64.t:0 "Canadians apply for West Point"
newengland.64.d:0 "The Class of 1944 has just arrived, and their numbers are far below expectations. As it is still necessary for Senators to recommend prospective young men, the decrease from 100 new cadets to just 14. It has been suggested that we allow Canadian politicians to recommend their young men to West Point. We are in dire need of new officers, and yet at the same time, this time honored tradition ensures that this institution isn't used by foreign powers, much less the Crown."
newengland.64.a:0 "Absolutely not!"
newengland.64.b:0 "We do need the people"

### Freedom Fliers ###
newengland.70.t:0 "Choosing our Propaganda"
newengland.70.d:0 "The "Freedom Fliers" initiative has been activated by our government but there is still much discussion about the content of the dropped messages as the right message could wreak havoc behind their lines but the wrong message could further bolster their resolve.\n\nWhether to strike the civilian population or the armed forces directly also remains a topic for debate as some have argued that the enemy homefront would be more susceptible to our message but a direct strike on their armed forces could lead to a more direct effect."
newengland.70.a:0 "Attempt to disrupt their attack plans with wrong information"
newengland.70.b:0 "Trick their troops in leaving gaps in their defences"
newengland.70.c:0 "Spread uncertainty on their Home Front"
newengland.70.e:0 "Try to demolarise their troops"

newengland.71.t:0 "The Tale of Private Bob 'Daredevil' Rogers"
newengland.71.d:0 "Private Bob had always been a well-known name in the corps of the Freedom Fliers but it was his recent heroic actions above syndicalist territory that earned him his nickname 'Daredevil'.\n\nSent out with 5 other members of his squadron, he and his compatriots got surprised by a CSA anti air installation that had been placed there after rumours of incursions into their air zone. Bad intel on our part ultimately led to disaster as the entire group of planes was shredded to pieces with only Private Bob and one of his crew mates surviving the crash. Landing deep behind enemy lines and with no way to reach our own positions, the two men took it upon themselves to perform a series of guerilla actions in the region, achieving critical success in hindering syndicalist supply lines and successfully forcing their command to deploy further troops to the region.\n\nTheir success would however not continue much longer as an attempt to recruit possible sympathizers amidst the civilian population backfired and a setup orchestrated to finally kill the two men led to the death of Bobs fellow soldier and the loss of his right ear.\n\nNow alone, out of ammunition and still with no way to return to base, Bob traveled all the way North to Lake Erie whilst always staying one step ahead of the syndicalist agents tracking him down.\n\nEmbarking with 50 refugees on a shaky vessel, Bob finally made it back into New York last week. Having been stuck alone with no contact deep behind enemy lines, it took the brave man 50 days to make his way back into our country leaving a trail of sabotage in his wake. Although granted leave by his commanding officers to recover from his adventure, Bob has reportedly already signed up for the next flight claiming that he would do it all over again for his beloved nation."
newengland.71.a:0 "The American nation thanks her son for his service!"

newengland.72.t:0 "Further Expansion of the 'Freedom Fliers'"
newengland.72.d:0 "Recent successes with the Corps have prompted many to question whether the planes should also be used to perform air drops behind enemy lines to supply the resistance cells with weapons and further equipment. Some have argued however that this deviates too far from the original peaceful mission of the Freedom Fliers and that the extra equipment and manpower necessary for the operations might very well be better spend elsewhere."
newengland.72.a:0 "Assign them the resources!"
newengland.72.b:0 "It's too risky"

newengland.73.t:0 "Sabotage on the Bedford Army Air Field"
newengland.73.d:0 "Under cover of darkness and with support from within, foreign operatives have succeeded in causing massive damage to the fighter planes stationed in Bedford. Dozens of planes have been lost or damaged and the hangars have suffered from various small explosions. We have thus far been unable to stop them and there isn't even an answer as to which faction the saboteurs adhere."
newengland.73.a:0 "Are we blind? Deploy the Garrison!"

newengland.80.t:0 "The Yankee Rebellion"
newengland.80.d:0 "While our intention upon occupying New England was to safeguard the locals from the ravages of the American Civil War, it seems many of them have taken exception. Several leaders in Boston have publicly accused Canada of desiring solely to return the area to British rule, to squeeze whatever we can out of the region so that we can return to the Home Isles, and that they would have been better off throwing their lot in with their American brothers and sisters. The fever pitch in the area has reached the point where we may have to reconsider our plan for New England self-government... or face a long period of uprisings."
newengland.80.a:0 "This will amount to nothing"
newengland.80.b:0 "Bah, very well - set up the provisional government"

newengland.81.t:0 "Riots in New England"
newengland.81.d:0 "The agitation of the so-called 'Yankee Rebellion' continues, with riots having broken out in several major cities across the region. Canadian forces have put down these disturbances with relatively small loss of life and property, but report that things are likely to get worse before they get better."
newengland.81.a:0 "Americans!"

newengland.82.t:0 "The Yankee Resistance"
newengland.82.d:0 "The rebellion in New England continues, this time with a group referring to itself as the 'Yankee Resistance' setting off explosives in several major areas. The resulting damage and panic has made for a headache, and calls for Canada to end its occupation have redoubled in force."
newengland.82.a:0 "Would they prefer to be in a civil war?!"

newengland.83.t:0 "Canadian Troops Attacked"
newengland.83.d:0 "Several military installations within the New England area have been attacked by the 'Yankee Resistance' - not enough to cause real damage, but enough to draw the notice of the newspapers and the public, keeping the occupation in the public eye far longer than we'd like."
newengland.83.a:0 "How annoying"

newengland.84.t:0 "Major Attack in [attack.GetName]"
newengland.84.d:0 "A major attack in [attack.GetName] by Yankee Resistance forces has left several hundred injured and a public debacle which has put the New England occupation in the Canadian news spotlight once again. The disruption in [attack.GetName] has been considerable, and [attack.GetName] newspapers are filled with headlines about how New Englanders should have fought in the civil war - going so far as to call siding with the Canadians a form of cowardice. There is pushback from many sides, but the rebellion continues to be a headache for Canadian occupation forces."
newengland.84.a:0 "Hopefully this will end at some point"

newengland.85.t:0 "Yankee Rebellion Over"
newengland.85.d:0 "It has taken many months, but it appears the so-called Yankee Rebellion in New England is over. Resistance leaders have either been captured or fled, and the remaining local governments all seem to be on board with the Canadian government - spurred on, one imagines, by the pictures of devastation throughout the rest of America playing across their newspaper pages. We should see no further trouble in the area."
newengland.85.a:0 "Finally!"

newengland.90.t:0 "Rejoining America"
newengland.90.d.forced:0 "Officials arrived today from [From.GetNameDef] to begin negotiations about a peaceful reunion between our government and theirs. There was little time to discuss the matter in Boston, however, as almost instantly a public campaign swept across the country demanding we dissolve the government at once. New England, the public feels, is not a real country - and its government does not have sufficient legitimacy to refuse the [From.GetAdjective] request."
newengland.90.d.choice:0 "Officials arrived today from [From.GetNameDef] to begin negotiations about a peaceful reunion between our government and theirs, now that the civil war is over and the victor decided. There are many who feel that the main purpose of New England's provisional government - to avoid the chaos of the civil war - has been served, and we should become part of America once again. There are others, however, who feel that New England has achieved its own sense of legitimacy. We have a place in the British sphere, and is being a part of [From.GetNameDef] what we truly want? Are they truly the America we remember?"
newengland.90.a:0 "It seems we have no choice but to agree..."
newengland.90.b:0 "We should rejoin America"
newengland.90.c:0 "No, this is not in our best interests"

newengland.91.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap]'s Request"
newengland.91.d:0 "The ambassador from [From.GetNameDef] has met with [Root.GetAdjective] officials and presented their plan: they wish to peacefully reunite with [requester.GetNameDef], effective immediately. Now that the civil war is done, they believe the purpose of New England's provisional government - namely to avoid the chaos and destruction - is also passed. America, they say, must be one once more. There is a mixed reaction within the government, though most agree that [requester.GetNameDef] will not sit idly by should we refuse."
newengland.91.a:0 "Then we wish them well"
newengland.91.b:0 "We agree, if [requester.GetNameDef] joins the Entente"
newengland.91.c:0 "No, we cannot permit that"

newengland.92.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Agrees"
newengland.92.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has agreed that the provisional government's purpose is done. They hold no claim over the New England region and wish no conflict with [requester.GetNameDef], nor intend to make any demands upon them for New England's return. [From.GetAdjective] forces have begun to leave the area immediately."
newengland.92.a:0 "Wonderful news!"

newengland.93.t:0 "Reunion with New England"
newengland.93.d:0 "Officials from New England delivered the message promptly: they will gladly unite with [Root.GetNameDef] at once. The purpose of their provisional government - to avoid the chaos of the civil war - is now over with, and they look forward to America being whole once again."
newengland.93.a:0 "Excellent!"

newengland.94.t:0 "The Canadian Concern"
newengland.94.d:0 "While the New England government is not a Canadian puppet, it would be false to suggest that it wasn't part of the British Empire - such as it is - and of great concern to the larger Canadian sphere of interest. The Canadian government is willing to allow New England to reunite with [requester.GetNameDef], since the reason for Canada's intervention in the region ended with the civil war, but they are asking that [requester.GetNameDef] join the Entente alliance. This would make up for New England's loss, and also be a way to pay back [CAN.GetNameDef] for saving American lives."
newengland.94.a:0 "We'll see where this goes..."
newengland.94.b:0 "We're fine with that request"
newengland.94.c:0 "No, they have no right to make that demand"

newengland.95.t:0 "[requester.GetNameDefCap] Agrees"
newengland.95.d:0 "Officials from [requester.GetNameDef] have returned with agreement - they will join the Entente in exchange for a peaceful reunion with New England, and as a way to pay back [Root.GetNameDef] for safeguarding so many American lives during the civil war."
newengland.95.a:0 "Might amenable of them!"

newengland.96.t:0 "[requester.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
newengland.96.d:0 "Officials from [requester.GetNameDef] have returned to Canada with a flat refusal - they will not bargain for New England's return, particularly since [CAN.GetNameDef] had no right to intervene in the civil war in the first place. The officials say that Canada took control of New England to safeguard themselves against the syndicalists, nothing more. With that threat gone, America should once again be whole."
newengland.96.a:0 "I wish mommy and daddy would stop fighting..."
newengland.96.b:0 "Very well, let them go"
newengland.96.c:0 "Then we refuse"

newengland.97.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
newengland.97.d.forced:0 "The Canadian government has returned to New England with a flat refusal - we may not rejoin America. It seems their promises of self-government, and their assurances that the intervention was for our safety, were all simply a sham. Since the New England lacks sufficient legitimacy to act as anything but a Canadian puppet, it has dissolved in a spasm of in-fighting and fury against the Canadians."
newengland.97.d.choice:0 "The Canadian government has returned to New England with a flat refusal - we may not rejoin America. It seems their promises of self-government, and their assurances that the intervention was for our safety, were all simply a sham: they intervened to safeguard British interests, nothing more. Now the New England government must decide for itself where its interests lie, and perhaps spark a war either way."
newengland.97.a:0 "So be it!"
newengland.97.b:0 "We will join [requester.GetNameDef] anyhow!"
newengland.97.c:0 "We remain with [From.GetNameDef]"

newengland.98.t:0 "New England Dissolves"
newengland.98.d:0 "With our refusal to allow New England to rejoin [requester.GetNameDef], their government has utterly dissolved due to internal conflict and a sense of it having no true legitimacy. The region is once again under our control, and very possibly may lead us into a war with [requester.GetNameDef]."
newengland.98.a:0 "So be it!"

newengland.99.t:0 "[war_country.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
newengland.99.d.exists:0 "For reasons not well understood, the New England government has decided that its best interests are served remaining a part of the British sphere. Many within our government are enraged, and wonder if New England's citizens feel the same as its government... or, perhaps it is better to say, the British?"
newengland.99.d.notexists:0 "While it appears New Englanders were more than willing to join with us peacefully, the Canadian intervention has exposed their provisional government for what it was: a puppet, subject to the will of the British crown. With their refusal to allow New England to choose its own destiny, the New England government has collapsed and been re-absorbed into [CAN.GetNameDef]."
newengland.99.a:0 "Then it's war!"
newengland.99.b:0 "We'll deal with this later"

newengland.100.t:0 "New England's Betrayal"
newengland.100.d:0 "While our government had refused New England's right to reunite with [requester.GetNameDef], it seems they eventually decided to do so anyhow. Our forces in the region have pulled out as American forces moved in, and there appears to be nothing we can do - unless we choose to force the issue and make this a matter of war."
newengland.100.a:0 "Then it's war!"
newengland.100.b:0 "Let them have it"

#NEE'S Army General Descriptions by Drozdovite#
###############################################

NEE_LESLIE_GROVES_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W August 17, 1896, in Albany, New York State, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Leslie Richard Groves Jr. was born in a family with quite a history in the military, considering his father had served in the Spanish-American War, the Philippines and the Boxer Rebellion. During his late high-school years, Groves started to enroll in courses at the University of Washington, hoping to get an appointment to the United States Military Academy. He got his wish when President Woodrow Wilson himself allowed him to compete for his vacancy, but his grades weren't high enough to be accepted. Instead, Groves joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the meantime while he prepared to retake West Point's entrance exam. In 1916, he took the entrance exam again, and was accepted, visiting the European battlefields on an educational tour in 1919 and graduating in 1920 as a second lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers, thanks to his experience in MIT. He was posted with the 4th Engineer corps stationed at Camp Lewis, and would later be moved to Fort Worden, where he'd meet his future wife, Grace Wilson. In late 1922, he was posted in Hawaii with the 3rd Engineer corps at the Schofield Barracks, where he earned a commendation for helping construct a trail from Kahuku to Pupukea. He would be assigned several times, becoming commander of Company D of the 1st Engineer Battalion, helping during the New England flood of 1927, being sent to Nicaragua in 1929 to conduct surveys for the construction of the Nicaragua Canal, and he being assigned to look over Nicaragua's water supply after the 1931 earthquake.
