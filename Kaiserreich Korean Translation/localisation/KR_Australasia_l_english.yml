### Events ###

australasia.1.t:0 "The Passing of King George V"
australasia.1.d:0 "The ousted king of Britain, George V, has finally succumbed to the illness that had plagued him since revolution swept through the home isles. His son, Edward, has ascended the throne of the British Empire, including that of the Antipodean dominions."
australasia.1.a:0 "The Entente enters a state of mourning..."
australasia.2.t:0 "A Special Conference of the Australasian Labour Party"
australasia.2.d:0 "Jack Lang was readmitted into the party after having been excluded for 5 years. Lang was originally excluded because of his dismissal from government by the contemporary governor of NSW Philip Game. A powerful orator and a populist through and through the re-admittance of Lang has caused consternation among the more leftist members of the Labour Party who, alongside much of trade union activists, see him more as a social feudalist inherently hostile to true socialist doctrine. It seems that the Australasian Labour Party is heading into a turbulent time."
australasia.2.a:0 "Let the leftists squabble among themselves!"
australasia.3.t:0 "The Government and Additional Funding for Military Training"
australasia.3.d:0 "Both Australia and New Zealand had a troubled relationship with the idea of conscription during the Weltkrieg. In Australia two consecutive plebiscites about the introduction of conscription were narrowly defeated leaving the ANZACs and other Antipodean units strictly volunteer-only. However with the Entente's defeat and the ensuring German expansion in the Pacific following the 1925 British Revolution the federal government has been anxious about strengthening the fighting capabilities of the Australasian army navy and air force. Today the incumbent government of Billy Hughes has proposed increasing the military's training strength and funding as a result of the rising tension in Europe and Asia. Some see it as a staging point for the government to launch a campaign arguing for the introduction of conscription and the need for a swift militarisation of the Antipodean dominions."
australasia.3.a:0 "Direct extra funds to military training!"
australasia.3.b:0 "We shan't compromise the volunteer nature of the army!"
australasia.4.t:0 "Charles Vyner Brooke Backs the New Guard"
australasia.4.d:0 "The exiled 'White Rajah' of Sarawak and noted Sydney socialite Charles Vyner Brooke has now openly begun to associate with the reactionary grouping known as 'the New Guard' led by Weltkrieg veteran Eric Campbell. Until now the Guard has been a minor force in Australasian politics but with their forceful revanchist rhetoric and populist flair the movement has begun to spread its influence beyond New South Wales especially gaining support among discharged servicemen and disgruntled officers. With Brooke's charm and considerable monetary resources the New Guard might just have gained the staging point for a showdown with the supposedly complacent and stagnating policies of Hughes and Bruce. The government should be prepared for any eventuality."
australasia.4.a:0 "What's a Bruce to do?"
australasia.5.t:0 "Campaign for the Introduction of Conscription?"
australasia.5.d:0 "Conscription has always been a touchy subject in the Antipodean Dominions. Several governments had attempted to enforce it through plebiscites but were defeated - sometimes narrowly - at the polling stations. However, several leading members of the incumbent administration argue that the time has come for a new attempt at replacing the volunteer ANZAC forces with a conscription-based and better trained armed forces. Such a 'conscription campaign' could either strengthen the government if successful or potentially break it - and thus strengthening the extremes of Australasia's political scene - if failing. Either way the amount of money the government is prepared to spend on this campaign will be an indicator of failure as well as success."
australasia.5.a:0 "We shall campaign vigorously!"
australasia.5.b:0 "Launch a moderate campaign to avoid a trouble."
australasia.5.c:0 "A volunteer force is adequate to defend the peaceful Antipodes."
australasia.6.t:0 "Announce a Plebiscite on Conscription?"
australasia.6.d:0 "With the government having launched a campaign to entice Australasia to the idea of conscription the populace look kindlier on the need for a stronger national defence. However, the issue needs to be resolved by plebiscite if the cabinet is to draw true strength from the campaign."
australasia.6.a:0 "Yes! Bring the question to the polls!"
australasia.6.b:0 "Try to formulate federal legalisation on the issue instead."
#australasia.7.t:0 "Not done yet"
#australasia.7.d:0 "Not done yet"
#australasia.7.a:0 "Not done yet"
australasia.8.t:0 "Conscription Plebiscite: Result - YES"
australasia.8.d:0 "The people of the Antipodean dominions have overwhelmingly backed the government in its desire to introduce conscription to our fair Confederation. This will greatly strengthen the current cabinet at the expense of the extremist factions of parliament and it is expected that Bruce will soon call for fresh elections to stabilise his mandate even further."
australasia.8.a:0 "Hurrah, Murray, Murray!"
australasia.9.t:0 "Conscription Plebiscite: Result - NO"
australasia.9.d:0 "The government has been completely defeated at the voting polls. Conscription has been absolutely refused by the Antipodean citizens, leaving the cabinet's prestige deeply damaged."
australasia.9.a:0 "Ack! What a humiliation! Bloody hell!"
australasia.10.t:0 "The Great Schism of the Australasian Labour Party"
australasia.10.d:0 "Since Jack Lang's re-admittance in February the Labour Party has been steaming with internal disputes. Today Lang struck back at the leftist members of the New South Wales party branch successfully having them excluded alongside their Syndicalist-friendly trade union comrades from the party. This purge of the NSW party has since rippled throughout the Confederation with Lang's supporters of moderate social populists and anti-Syndicalist union supporters ostracising and marginalising their more leftist opponents. This ‘Great Schism of the Australasian Labour Party has firmly separated the Antipodean worker's movement into a reformist and populist rump Labour Party and a revolutionary movement consolidating around the Australasian Council of Trade Unions. Yet all is not well in Labour since friction still exists between Lang and the popular John J. Curtin."
australasia.10.a:0 "This is both disturbing and encouraging!"
