###Leader Desc###
POLITICS_AZIZ_JBS_DESC:0 "The Rashids triumphant, the young Abdulaziz Rashid takes his place as the First among the Emirs of Arabia. His father's tent now replaced with a palace far away from the harshness of his childhood. Abdulaziz Rashid now looks towards a the frontiers of traditional Arabia where his tribe can prosper. Abdulaziz Rashid proclaims that his dynasty will replace the authoritarian attitude of Wahabbism. At the same time however, salafists flock to Ha'il to pitch to Abdulaziz a renewal of Mu'taizilism that his sunni followers see as the next step in modernizing Islam."
POLITICS_GHAZI_DESC:0 "The only son of the late Faisal bin Hussein, Ghazi escaped the wrath of the Turks in Hejaz by hiding in El Esah with his cousin Zeid bin Hussein. In El Esah, Ghazi was cared for by the remaining forces of Lawrence's rebellion, but financial assistance from Britain dried up in 1926. This left Ghazi to seek protection from Ottoman soldiers with the Howietat. This led to a temporary truce between the Rashids and the Hashmites when the Howietat were admitted into Jabal Shammar. The influence of Ghazi's name is still strong, as well as the legacy of the Arab Revolt among Bedouins yearning for freedom. Thus it was Ghazi's triumphant return to Mecca after the fall of the Ottomans that restored the greatness of his name."
POLITICS_SAEED_DUBAI_DESC:0 "Where war and rivalry only led to the stagnation of Arabia, trade and deleation will restore. This came from a speech given by the Emir Saeed al Maktoum upon recieving his office. His term as Emir of Dubai was one of exemplary diplomacy and a care for his peoples' well being. Submission to the Sauds over a bloodbath in the 1920s, creation of economic ties to India when pearling failed the emirate, and finally a promise of peace. His dynasty being unilaterally more wealthy than the Rashids or Hashmitie may of helped as well."
POLITICS_SHAKBUT_IRQ_DESC:0 "The House Al Nahyan was stuck in the crossroads of the Saud Rashid war. Their cities taxed cruelly by the Sauds, and thier commerce stunted. This destruction resolved Shakhbut Al Nahyan to formulate an economic plan for recovery involving western economists. This plan was presented to the Emirs, and early sucesses paved the way to Shakhbut's election. Al Nahyan weaves in hsi speeches the tales of how his ancestors of the Bani Yas migrated to the coast and found a land suitable to grow. Shakhbut's personal repuation among the Emirs is outstanding, and is only corrupted by the schemes of his own family. Shakhbut is confident that his repuation can save him from the macinations of family politics."
POLITICS_ABTAN_IRQ_DESC:0 "Atban was the one time rival and now successor to the famous soldier and Sheikh Auda abu Tayi. When Auda's ambitons failed, he retreated from Aqab into the Al Nefud. The Howietat's livestock starved, wells were denied to them. In desperation Atban ibn Jazi choose to again put aside his rivalry for the sake of thier people and seek aid from the Rashids. This bid was sucessful, and Atban became the representative of the Howietat. Auda's and his reputations for joining the Arab Revolt and facing the harshest of the turkish reprisals made Atban a surprisingly good candidate for Emir. Atban challenged the Emirs to live among their own, and was rewarded with cooperation."
POLITICS_SABAH_IRQ_DESC:0 "The Emirs of Kuwait began the century by setting the Rashid Saud conflict in motion, and it has finally paid off for them with the ascension of Jabe Al Sabah. It was Jaber's father who gave the Sauds arms and men in 1906 to retake Riyadh, a decision that would come back to haunt his son. The Ikhwan, Ibn Sauds frenzied soldiers attacked Kuwait when the British left, leaving devestation along thw 1st Ring Road. Al Sabah prostrated himself to the Rashids, who forgave him and announced their protection of Kuwait. Now the Sabah are owed favors from the Rashids accrued during wartime, who exchanged this debt for a promise to elect Jaber al Sabah. Jaber himself reminding the emirs that he was first into battle on his horse against the Sauds, and that he alone could lead the charge against the Ottomans."
POLITICS_SYNDIE_JBS_DESC:0 "A brother to Abdulaziz bin Saud bin Abdulaziz, Mishaal did not follow his family path. His interests came not from the numerous clans that paraded through Hail, but from the ordinary citizens of Shammar. It was under his mothers instruction that Mishaal came to see the Rashid Emir and all emirates as haughty and aloof. This pushed Mishaal into seeking examples of leaders connected to their people. He found inspiration in Muhammad al Ashmar, whose provockative ideas about islamic law. Mishaal came to believe that Islamic Law tended towards socialism, so he made that clear to his family. Mishaal's exile ended when the Internationale entered Arabia, and people remarked that he was the only among the Emirs to express concern for the common peopele. In this strange way, Mishaal vindicated his familys name."
