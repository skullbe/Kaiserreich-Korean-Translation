Elements within the Korps Mariner and Navy are both advocating the idea of making it autonomous of the naval command structure in order to better allow the Korps Mariniers to operate as a rapid reaction force, effectively creating a new branch of the military. We are inclined to support the idea."

 HOL_paratrooper_focus_desc:0 "Some enterprising Army generals are proposing the establishment of a dedicated paratrooper unit.

 ### Events ###
 hol.1.t:0 "Zuiderzee Works"
 hol.1.d:0 "After the completion of the Afsluitdijk, the large enclosing dam, the draining of the polders at the Northwest of the Zuiderzee could continue. The Dutch government has voted a budget of 126 millions of guilders for the project."
 hol.1.a:0 "Go ahead with the project."
 hol.1.b:0 "We have no interest in this."
 hol.2.t:0 "Reclaimed Land"
 hol.2.d:0 "The Zuiderzeeworks are bearing fruit as the first harvest is collected in Noordoostpolder."
 hol.2.a:0 "God created the world but the Netherlands were created by the Dutch!"
 hol.3.t:0 "The Berlin Stock Market Crashes!"
 hol.3.d:0 "On February 3rd, 1936, the Berlin stock market crashed, plunging the world into a depression. Our nation has strong economic ties with Germany and many German companies are shutting down their Dutch factories."
 hol.3.a:0 "This could be bad"
 hol.4.t:0 "Worsening Living Standards"
 hol.4.d:0 "Ever since February 3rd, Black Monday, and the collapse of the Berlin Stock Market, the economy of the Netherlands has been suffering. Our reliance on Germany has resulted in many of our workers becoming unemployed as German companies choose to cut jobs in Holland first, spreading Syndicalist ideas among the population, and the Social Democratic Workers' Party has been gaining in numbers. Many of their ideas have merit, but in order to pass them we would have to bring them into the governing coalition."
 hol.4.a:0 "Invite the Social Democrats to enact reforms"
 hol.4.b:0 "There is no need to compromise with socialists"
 hol.5.t:0 "Dutch Elections"
 hol.5.d:0 "Inviting the SDAP into the government, and giving people the (rightful) impression that they are responsible for most of the reforms that have kept a modicum of prosperity, has contributed to their success. It's unlikely that the right will be able to once again form a coalition that can keep them out of government, though some have recommended manipulating the elections to keep us in power, which the people might tolerate as long as their standard of living is maintained."
 hol.5.a:0 "Left - SDAP. They gave us a Plan for Labour!"
 hol.5.b:0 "Middle - SDAP secures a minority!"
 hol.5.c:0 "Right - A coalition is formed by the CHU, ARP, and the KVP!"
 hol.6.t:0 "Labour Strikes"
 hol.6.d:0 "The failure of the government to act has led to labour strikes. Most are confident that they'll blow over once the German economy recovers."
 hol.6.a:0 "The police will control them"
 hol.6.b:0 "The people are right - we must act!"
 hol.7.t:0 "The Zwolle Massacre"
 hol.7.d:0 "A Socialist rally outside Zwolle was met by local police, who moved to disperse it. However, one of the strikers threw a bomb into the midst of the police, who returned fire into the crowd with their pistols. 4 policemen and two dozen strikers were left dead, and the next day the local authorities hanged 4 SDAP leaders, all of whom were on the speaker's podium at the time. There are growing calls to compromise with the SDAP, as more and more of the population turns against the government."
 hol.7.a:0 "We shall stand fast!"
 hol.7.b:0 "Blood has been spilled, we must give in to the SDAP"
 hol.8.t:0 "The Plan for Labour"
 hol.8.d:0 "Now that the SDAP is in power, after being denied for twenty years by various right-wing coalitions, it can begin to implement its Plan for Labour, created after Black Monday to improve economic conditions. The Plan for Labour includes ideas to increase employment, nationalise vital industries, and implementing a system of unemployment benefits, by devaluing the Gilder and allowing the national debt to rise, alongside other more extreme methods."
 hol.8.a:0 "We've waited a long time for this day"
 hol.9.t:0 "Syndicalist forces in the Netherlands"
 hol.9.d:0 "Labour strikes, and brutal crackdowns by the police, have fostered the growth of a large revolutionary movement in the Netherlands. If we give them support in the form of training and equipment, they may be able to overthrow the government."
 hol.9.a:0 "Give aid in overthrowing the reactionaries"
 hol.9.b:0 "There are some things that just shouldn't be tried..."
 hol.10.t:0 "Joint French-British action against Dutch reactionaries"
 hol.10.d:0 "Commune of France decided to support Dutch comrades in their fight against reactionary government and they are asking us for our help. Together we can help the Dutch proletariat to rise and smash monarchists and capitalists. On the other side this might rise the tensions in relations with Germany, leading even to war."
 hol.10.a:0 "Let's do this!"
 hol.10.b:0 "There are some things that just shouldn't be tried..."
 hol.11.t:0 "Syndicalist Revolution!"

 hol.15.t:0 "Fate of the Royal Family"

We have received info that they are planning to escape to the remaining parts of the Dutch colonial empire to lead their fight against us from there. Our militia together with parts of army plans to capture them before they flee from the Netherlands."
 hol.15.a:0 "The Royal Family successfully escapes the Netherlands!"
 hol.15.b:0 "The Royal Family is captured and brutally killed by the militia!"
 hol.16.t:0 "The Fate of Caribbean Netherlands"
 hol.16.d:0 "As Syndicalist parties in the Netherlands with direct support from France were able to seize power, their colonial empire can be now used as a springboard to spread vile Syndicalist influence into different parts of world. To prevent syndicalism from gaining influence in the Caribbean, we must seize the Caribbean Netherlands."
 hol.16.a:0 "Seize control of the Caribbean Netherlands!"
 hol.16.b:0 "Rather not"
 hol.17.t:0 "The Fate of Dutch West Indies"
 hol.17.d:0 "As Syndicalist parties in the Netherlands with direct support from France were able to seize power, the large Dutch colonial empire can be now used as a springboard to spread vile Syndicalist influence into different parts of world. To prevent Syndicalism from gaining influence in the Pacific, we must seize Borneo, Sumatra, and parts of Western New Guinea."

 hol.18.a:0 "Seize control of parts of the Dutch East Indies!"
 hol.18.b:0 "Rather not"
 hol.19.t:0 "Caribbean Federation takes control of the Caribbean Netherlands!"
 hol.19.d:0 "With our state in chaos following the Syndicalist takeover, the Caribbean Federation used this opportunity to seize control of the Caribbean Netherlands. Currently there is very little that we can do to stop the Caribbean Federation."
 hol.19.a:0 "There is nothing we can do"
 hol.19.b:0 "This means WAR!"
 hol.20.t:0 "German Empire takes control of parts of the Dutch East Indies!"
 hol.20.d:0 "With our state in chaos following the Syndicalist takeover, the German Empire used this opportunity to seize control of parts of the Dutch East Indies. Currently there is very little that we can do to stop the German Empire."

 hol.24.a:0 "A new beginning!"
 hol.25.t:0 "Netherlands in exile foreign policy"
 hol.25.d:0 "The recent takeover by Syndicalist scum left remnants of the once proud Dutch colonial Empire in precarious positions. In order to liberate our homeland from the Syndicalist usurpers we need to join one of major alliances. Which alliance shall we try to join?"

 hol.25.b:0 "We can cooperate with Japan"
