alash.1.t:0 "Independence for Alash autonomy?"
alash.1.d:0 "Our country, despite nominally part of Russia with autonomous status has been de facto independent from the singing of the Minsk treaty in 1920. Despite Russian attempt in 1925 to fully integrate us into Russia during repelling invasion from Turkestan, our status remained unchanged thanks to the attempt of admiral Koltschak to seize power in Russia. Now with Russia engulfed in chaos, the time has come to throw off chains of Russian oppression and end farce of Alash-Orda being part of Russia !"

alash.23.t:0 "War in Central Asia"
alash.23.d:0 "The recent outbreak of hostilities in Central Asia is worrying to say the least, and brings great destabilisation to our frontiers. The Kazakhs have recently proclaimed that they shall fight on their own against Turkestan, but it seems that they are too weak to survive for very long.
