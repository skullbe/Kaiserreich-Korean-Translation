### Events ###
bol.1.t:0 "The Possibilities of Privatisation"
bol.1.d:0 "The economy is a wreck and has been since 1905. There is nothing we can do to change this, it is a fact of Bolivian life. Although, we may be able to gain profit for ourselves if we privatized many industries like water, energy, transportation and electricity. This may make life harder for the people, but we'll profit."
bol.1.a:0 "If it doesn't turn a quick buck, put it up for sale!"
bol.1.b:0 "This is a betrayal of the Bolivian people!"
bol.2.t:0 "Unemployment and The Class Division in Bolivia"
bol.2.d:0 "Since the privatisation of virtually every industry in Bolivia, the middle class has been destroyed and now everyone is either as poor as a native or a member of the mega-rich. There are little to no jobs left in Bolivia, and the jobs that still exist don't provide acceptable wages or benefits."
bol.2.a:0 "There is nothing we can do"
bol.3.t:0 "Aftermath of the Platine War"
bol.3.d:0 "Since her formation Bolivia has not fared well in terms of her foreign policy, suffering hurtful losses. A border conflict with Chile led to the ‘Saltpetre War' (1879 – 1883) which Bolivia lost despite an alliance with Peru, which ended with the nation having to cede the coastal province of Antofagasta, losing its access to the sea. In 1903 Brazil and Bolivia signed the Treaty of P?troplis, ceding the important rubber producing province Acre to Brazil. In 1932, tensions with Paraguay over the Gran Chaco region touched off what would later come to be known as the ‘Great South American War'. Initially, Bolivia was successful against the Paraguayans had quickly overran the country, unfortunately though, the Bolivian occupation of Paraguay prompted Argentinean intervention in 1933, and a in a quick campaign Argentinean troops quickly liberated Paraguay and settled in for the winter.In 1934, Argentina renewed their offensive and scored several great victories against the Bolivian forces, and Bolivia seemed totally defeated. However, in another twist of the war, their hope was rekindled, as Brazil chose this time to intervene on their side. Unfortunately however the Brazilians focused the thrust of their offensives towards the La Plata River, leaving the Bolivians to look to their own defences, and this error of judgement lead to a humiliating final defeat of Bolivia at the hands of Argentina in late 1934. In the resulting peace, Bolivia was forced to accept the independence of Paraguay and relinquish their claims on the Gran Chaco region. After another short campaign by Argentinean forces Brazil was defeated in 1935, and in the resulting peace Uruguay and Paraguay were 'federated' with Argentina to create the Union of La Plata.In 1936 Bolivia stands at a crossroads, on one hand she is burning with a passion for revenge against ‘La Plata', but on the other hand, she is wary of becoming too closely aligned with Brazil. However, with the government in La Plata beginning to assert claims over parts of Bolivia relations are becoming even further strained and closer ties with Brazil may well be unavoidable. Whatever the situation, Bolivia will have to play her cards wisely, for the moment of final decision will come soon…"
