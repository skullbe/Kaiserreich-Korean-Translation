### Events ###
japfor.1.t:0 "만철이 역대 최고 수입을 기록하다"
japfor.1.d:0 "After the conclusion of the last phase of the Chinese Civil Wars in 1928, and our intervention to protect our sphere of influence against German encroachment, Zhang Zuolin's Fengtian Clique proclaimed itself as the sole legitimate republican government of all China. Following the promulgation of an Imperial Ordinance ordering the development of "indivisible relations with the Japanese Empire", the government has supported a number of programs impressing our influence over its government so as to its role as an effective proxy in China. As a result, we maintain a great deal of influence over Fengtian, further reinforced by garrisons. \n\n The core of our efforts is the South Manchuria Railway Company, or "Mantetsu" for short, which has been operating in Manchuria since 1906. While a powerful symbol of our interests in China prior to the intervention, the company has since become responsible for developing and exploiting virtually every important aspect of the Manchurian economy, propelling China's Northeast to become Japan's primary source of coal and steel, as well as the producer of over half the world's soybean supply. Today, Mantetsu has announced its highest profits to date."

As part of a diplomatic treaty, we have allowed a major railway to run between the two nations as a symbol of unity. Ironically, the railway is now serving to justify war. The colonel of the Japanese garrison protecting the railway has staged an incident resulting in the deaths of 25 Manchurians and 12 Japanese, claiming Qing aggression as the cause."

Whether this was merely gross incompetence and mismanagement, or something more sinister, is unclear, but there is little doubt that the Fengtian Government finds itself in a dire economic situation and has requested our help. \n\n While our influence will ensure that both Mitsui and the Bank of Japan are paid what they are due before anything else, a failing Fengtian Government would severely upset their claims to legitimacy and our claims to benevolence.

With the reserve apparently containing far less than the Fengtian government claimed, its economy has spiralled out of control as the government loses credibility by the hour, and it seems likely that this crass and foolish attempt to deflect blame is mostly a reaction to their internal political situation. \n\n All the same, we can deny these ridiculous assertions, but can we also let this grave insolence go unpunished?"

Fengtian's ambassador has also spent the last several hours attempting to convince the Foreign Ministry, in private of course, that this was merely a necessity of internal politics, and that no ill-will is intended toward Japan. \n\n While this may, or may not, be the case, there is little question as to whether this reduces our influence over Fengtian, and in turn could compromise the security of the Korean peninsula.
