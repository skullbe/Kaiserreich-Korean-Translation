### Events ###
japfor.1.t:0 "Mantetsu Declares Record Earnings"
japfor.1.d:0 "After the conclusion of the last phase of the Chinese Civil Wars in 1928, and Japan's intervention to protect its sphere of influence against German encroachment, Zhang Zuolin's Fengtian Clique proclaimed itself as the sole legitimate republican government of all China. Following the promulgation of an Imperial Ordinance ordering “the development of Fengtian into an independent nation possessing indivisible relations with the Japanese Empire" a year later, the Manchurian economy was gradually influenced with an intent to strengthen control over its government and prepare it to support the Imperial war machine. As a result, Japan maintains a great deal of influence over Fengtian, further reinforced by garrisons and an occupation zone. \n\n The core of Japanese efforts was the South Manchuria Railway Company, or “Mantetsu” for short, which had already been operating in Manchuria since 1906. While a powerful symbol of Japanese interests in China prior to the intervention, the company has since become responsible for developing and exploiting virtually every important aspect of the Manchurian economy, propelling China's Northeast to become Japan's primary source of coal and steel, as well as the producer of over half the world's soybean supply. Today, Mantetsu has announced its highest profits to date."
japfor.1.a:0 "Great!"

japfor.2.t:0 "Economic Exploitation of Fengtian is no longer possible"

japfor.3.t:0 "The Great Railway Incident"
japfor.3.d:0 "China has long been in the eyes of Japan. To the south of the Fengtian Republic lies the Qing Empire, one of our most powerful opponents on the continent, and the key to influence over all China. As part of a diplomatic treaty, we have allowed a major railway to run between the two nations as a symbol of unity. Ironically, the railway is now serving to justify war. The colonel of the Japanese garrison protecting the railway has staged an incident resulting in the deaths of 25 Manchurians and 12 Japanese, claiming Qing aggression as the cause."
japfor.3.a:0 "Worrying..."

japfor.7.b:0 "Reject their demands outright."

japfor.8.t:0 "The Qing reject our Demands!"

japfor.11.a:0 "Their offer is fair, we accept the German compromise"
japfor.11.b:0 "This is offer is not worth the paper it is written on!"

japfor.12.t:0 "Compromise"
japfor.12.d:0 "The Germans have offered both sides a compromise: we give our portion of Inner Mongolia to the Japanese in exchange for peace and, afterwards, we sign a Non-Aggression Pact to ensure peace in the future."
japfor.12.a:0 "One worthless state in exchange for peace? It's a deal!"
japfor.12.b:0 "We won't give them an inch!"

japfor.13.t:0 "The Qing Empire accepts the Compromise"
japfor.13.d:0 "The Qing have accepted the German engineered compromise, and we have received the Qing held territory in the Inner Mongolia region, along with a Pact of Non-Aggression."

japfor.19.t:0 "The Fading Sun"
japfor.19.d:0 "After the utter defeat of the Imperial Japanese Army, our imperial army controls huge swathes of land in Manchuria and Korea whilst the IJN are reduced to attempting mere blockades. Our spies in Tokyo report severe dissent and war weariness among the populace. In light of this, the government has called a conference in occupied Port Arthur to determine our war aims."

japfor.19.b:0 "We push for total victory!"

japfor.20.t:0 "The Fading Sun"
japfor.20.d:0 "This is a dark day for the Empire of the Sun. Chinese forces have ousted our men from their vital bases in Manchuria and Korea. On top of this, a declaration has been sent out from Port Arthur by the imperial government offering terms that demand our surrender of all territories on the Chinese mainland as well as the return of Taiwan and independence of Korea."

japfor.25.a:0 "How humiliating! Sue for peace."
japfor.25.b:0 "Our empire shall fight to the bitter end!"

japfor.26.t:0 "The Qing Empire was defeated"
japfor.26.d:0 "Following a series of bloody battles along the Qing border, the Qing government had realised that they were too weak to defend against the might of the Japanese Empire and capitulated. Now with Japanese forces occupying the Qing capital, it must be decided what shall be done with the Qing."
japfor.26.a:0 "We will control the Chinese from the shadows..."

japfor.27.a:0 "We won't let them down!"

japfor.28.t:0 "Japanese Proposal"
japfor.28.d:0 "Japanese Empire has approached us with interesting proposal. Since Japan plans war with German Empire and its allies in Pacific it needs us in its alliance bloc, since we are located near many crucial German colonies in Pacific. In order to gain our approval, Japan promise us entire Malay peninsula together with Indochina after end of victorious war against German Empire. Do we want to join Co-Prosperity Sphere and risk potentially lethal conflict with German Empire?"
japfor.28.a:0 "Yes, we will drive out Germans from Asia!"

japfor.30.t:0 "German Proposal"
japfor.30.d:0 "The recent Japanese diplomatic offensive has claimed great success, and our old rival Siam has entered into an alliance with Japan. This radical move directly threatens our national sovereignty, since Siam is determined to gain control over all of Burma! Fortunately, since German colonies are also greatly endangered by this latest Japanese initiative, the German Empire has decided to invite us to join Mitteleuropa to counter rising Japanese influence. In order to gain our acceptance, the German Empire promises us territories lost to Siam in 1925 after the end of the war against Japan and its allies. Do we want to join Mitteleuropa and risk potentially lethal conflict with Japan and its Co-Prosperity Sphere?"
japfor.30.a:0 "This is the only way to secure our independence!"
japfor.30.b:0 "Refuse their offer!"

japfor.31.t:0 "Burma joins Mitteleuropa!"

japfor.31.a:0 "Welcome!"

japfor.32.t:0 "Involvement of the A.O.G.!"
japfor.32.d:0 "With the eruption of the grand military conflict in Asia, some important members of our general staff have suggested the direct involvement of our colony the A.O.G. in the ongoing conflict, since its vast armies and strategic location could decisively turn the tide in our favour. Still, the A.O.G. board of directors warns us that, although they are willing to help the fatherland, this effort could seriously destabilise the already fragile situation in their colony..."
japfor.32.a:0 "The A.O.G. must fight with the Fatherland!"

japfor.33.t:0 "War in the Far East!"
japfor.33.d:0 "With the eruption of widespread military conflict in East Asia, the German Empire, despite our pleas, decided to involve our colony in the war. There is not much to decide on this matter, as we can not disobey a direct order from Berlin......"
japfor.33.a:0 "This is the only way to preserve our existence!"

japfor.35.t:0 "Germany is losing its War"
japfor.35.d:0 "Our mortal enemy, the German Empire, is losing its war. This may be an opportune moment to issue an ultimatum demanding all German lands in Asia. The time to cast off the yoke of Western imperialism may be at hand!"
japfor.35.a:0 "Issue the ultimatum. Banzai!"
japfor.35.b:0 "Do Nothing."

japfor.36.t:0 "The Japanese have issued an ultimatum"
japfor.36.d:0 "The Japanese Consul in Saigon has delivered a letter from Tokyo. The news is dire; since we have lost the war and were forced to capitulate, we have lost all might and power in Asia, and the Japanese like hungry vultures are going to incorporate our Asian colonies into their Co-Prosperity Sphere."
japfor.36.a:0 "Submit to their demands."
japfor.36.b:0 "Declare War."

japfor.38.t:0 "The Germans have refused our Ultimatum"

japfor.41.b:0 "Agree to their demands."

japfor.42.t:0 "Germany refuses our Ultimatum"

japfor.43.t:0 "Germany accepts our Conditions"

japfor.44.t:0 "Japan attacks the Qing Empire!"
japfor.44.d:0 "With the eruption of the grand military conflict in Asia, some important members of our general staff have suggested the direct involvement of our colony the A.O.G. in the ongoing conflict, since its vast armies and strategic location could decisively turn the tide in our favour. Still, the A.O.G. board of directors warns us that, although they are willing to help the fatherland, this effort could seriously destabilise the already fragile situation in their colony..."

japfor.47.t:0 "Japanese Demands"
japfor.47.d:0 "Since the eruption of the conflict in Western Europe, Germany's position in Asia has seriously weakened. Japan has decided to use this opportunity to force us into submission. Their ambassador has brought us an official demand regarding a total political and economic restructuring of our state. Accepting this would mean an end of our status as an independent state. However, fighting an obviously strong Japan could mean complete disaster for us and the entirety of China. How shall we react?"
japfor.47.a:0 "Accept them. We cannot hope to fight against Japan."
japfor.47.b:0 "Refuse them outright!"

japfor.48.t:0 "Submission of the Qing Empire"

japfor.50.t:0 "Japan invites us to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere"
japfor.50.d:0 "The Japanese, seeing an empty space now that the Americans have decided to leave, invited us to join their alliance. This could be chance to make our nation rich and prosperous, but it could be deadly as Japan needs new markets and wants to spread its political influence."

japfor.69.t:0 "Korea asks for Aid"
japfor.69.d:0 "The Korean government-in-exile has approached the German government for military and political aid in retaking their lands from Japan.

japfor.69.c:0 "We're not interested."

japfor.751.a:0 "We have no choice..."

japfor.133.d:0 "Recent cooperation with Russian state in the conquest of Mongolia proved the dramatic resurrection of the Russian armed forces. Conquest of Siberia would be extremely difficult if we are to face this united and strong Russian army, fighting on its own soil. Perhaps we should use this change in relations as signal to re-orientate our expansions towards safer goals, such as fragmented China or the unstable pacific. And, perhaps we could try and bring belligerent Russia, whose ambitions are clearly aimed against German hegemony in Pacific and Europe, into our block in order to secure our northern flank."

japfor.134.t:0 "An Alliance with Japan?"
japfor.134.d:0 "Recent cooperation with Japan in the conquest of Mongolia greatly strengthened mutual relations between two great nations. Japan decided to offer us participation in their alliance bloc, which is clearly aimed against German dominance in the Pacific and Asia, and want to form an alliance with us. How we shall respond?"

japfor.136.b:0 "Never!"

japfor.137.t:0 "Negotiations Collapse"

japfor.138.t:0 "Transamur is Russian!"
japfor.138.d:0 "Facing the threat of Russian military force and deprived of the support of the local capitalists and the Japanese, Transamur's government is ready to collapse in the face of popular discontent. We can now do what we like with Transamur, but it has been independent for a long time and will be difficult to integrate into our country. Perhaps some sort of compromise is needed?"
japfor.138.a:0 "No compromise - put the leadership on trial and incorporate Transamur"
japfor.138.b:0 "Administer Transamur as an autonomous zone. For now."

japfor.139.t:0 "Peace with Japanese Empire?"
japfor.139.d:0 "Our military campaign against the Japanese Empire has been a military catastrophe so far. Nearly the whole of East-Siberia has fallen. Many politicians are demanding a peace treaty with Japan to end this war, even if at great expense..."

japfor.144.t:0 "Peace with Japanese Empire?"

japfor.144.b:0 "The turning point is near."

japfor.145.t:0 "Russia Offers Siberia for Peace"
japfor.145.d:0 "Our glorious troops have reached the Ural mountains. The humiliated Russian leadership is offering us control over whole Siberia if we sign peace with the broken Russian state. On the other hand, we have reached our main target to bring Siberia under direct military control and continuing this military struggle would serve little purpose."

japfor.148.c:0 "Keep it."

japfor.149.t:0 "Outbreak of Trans-Siberian War"
japfor.149.d:0 "A minor conflict over a section of the Trans-Siberian railroad culminated in war between Russia and Mongolia. This thwarts our plans of expansion. Maybe this is a good opportunity for us to launch our long-prepared military operations."

japfor.202.d:0 "When the Bank of Japan and Mitsui Bank, two of the largest in our country, requested payment on their loans in quick succession, Fengtian's Central Bank defaulted due to a sudden and supposedly inexplicably insufficient silver reserve. Whether this was merely gross incompetence and mismanagement, or something more sinister, is unclear, but there is little doubt that the Fengtian Government finds itself in a dire economic situation and has requested our help. \n\n While our influence will ensure that both Mitsui and the Bank of Japan are paid what they are due before anything else, a failing Fengtian Government would severely upset their claims to legitimacy and our claims to benevolence. We have the option of bailing them out."

With the reserve apparently containing far less than the Fengtian government claimed, its economy has spiralled out of control as the government loses credibility by the hour, and it seems likely that this crass and foolish attempt to deflect blame is mostly a reaction to their internal political situation. \n\n All the same, we can deny these ridiculous assertions, but can we also let this grave insolence go unpunished?"

Contrary to our expectations, however, this was accompanied by a diplomatic letter explaining that the Mission had achieved its goals, and that Fengtian is now sufficient in its command capacity. Fengtian's ambassador has also spent the last several hours attempting to convince the Foreign Ministry, in private of course, that this was merely a necessity of internal politics, and that no ill-will is intended toward Japan. \n\n While this may, or may not, be the case, there is little question as to whether this reduces our influence over Fengtian, and in turn could compromise the security of the Korean peninsula. Who is to say what these Chinese will do next?"

This may force the more patriotic and militaristic elements of the government to independently declare war, and the consequences of such a situation should also be considered."

Now that the company wants to expand, it has apparently begun digging without a permit, destroying farmland in the process, and triggering protests by the native Chinese. These protests escalated into violence, and lead to some regrettable actions by our local garrison. \n\n The Fengtian Government has released a long-winded and not at all atypical denouncement of our actions.
