POLITICS_ALEXANDR_KOLCHAK_DESC:0 "Once a polar explorer and commander in the Imperial Russian Navy, who fought in the Russo-Japanese War and the Weltkrieg, Kolchak once tried to claim himself a title of 'Supreme Ruler of Russia' but failed to gather enough support. His relations with newly created Russian Republic's government were quite hostile due Brest-Litovsk Treaty which they signed, and only worsen in 1925 after Kolchak's unsuccessful coup d'etat against 'German lapdogs'. A rogue admiral managed to flee Russia and found shelter in pro-Japanese Transamur state. Now, the puppet of Hirohito, Kolchak trying to gather enough power to overthrow Petrograd government and install himself as leader of Russia."
POLITICS_NIKOLAY_SMIRNOV_DESC:0 "A man of science, Smirnov was forced to go into exile due his critical views on Brest-Litovsk Treaty. Transamur has become his new home where Smirnov managed to join the ranks of influental politics. Incredible wisdom made him a leader of anti-Kolchak movement. Now, when rogue admiral is dead and era of dictatorship has come to an end, his wisdom and extraordinary intelligence helped him to gain a majority of votes on Presidental elections."
POLITICS_SHUMYATSKY_DESC:0 "His parents were exiled into Siberia because they refused to left their home. This fact always reminds young Boris about how corrupted the tsarist government in Petrograd is. A former bolshevik, Shumyatsky was forced to left Russia after the Civil War ends and join the ranks of Transamur politicians. Despite his political views have become more Right-Wing associated, Boris still pursues the goal to create a welfare state. His past experience as bolshevik agitator helped Shumyatsky to gain a majority of votes on Presidental elections."
POLITICS_MERKULOV_DESC:0 "A former leader of pro-Japanese Provisional Primorsk Government, Merkulov's cabinet was incorporated into Semyonov's Transbaikal state. Now, when Kolchak is no more and democracy is finally returns to Vladivostok, Merkulov, a son of a humble peasant, is eager to lead Transamur into prosperious future. His connections with people helped Merkulov to gain a majority of votes on Presidental elections."

POLITICS_WOJ_DESC:0 "A leader of Chechoslovakian Legion and hero of Russian Civil War, Wojciechowski has refused to admit Brest-Litovsk treaty. Outrageous, he ceased all the contacs with Russian Republic's government, and left for Transamur where he found many supporters. A right hand of admiral Kolchak, Sergei betrayed and killed his 'friend'. A less agressive and ambitious than rogue admiral, a hardened veteran Wojciechowski is ready to go West."
POLITICS_SEMYONOV_DESC:0 "An Ataman of Baikal cossacks, Semyonov and his boys have managed to established a Transabaikal state, currently known as Transamur, in order to fight bolsheviks in Russian Far East. His newborn country was soon puppeted by Japan. When Kolchak 1925 coup has failed and rogue admiral left Russia, Semyonov was forced to resign and continue his career as military commander. One way or another, but the 'father-of-state' managed to return in big politics. Semyonov's only goal is to see Transamur prosperious and he is not willing to wage uncertain wars."
POLITICS_YUI_DESC:0 "An old general Mitsue was used to leading a Japanese Expeditionary Corps during the Russian Civil War. A honorable war hero, he has been granted an ultimate gift from the emperor: to peacefully rule the lands he conquered many years ago. An old man is an isolationist and will never wage any war by himself. With him into position, the dream of Greater Transamur has died."
