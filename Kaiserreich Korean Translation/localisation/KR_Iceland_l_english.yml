ice.9996.t:0 "1922년 아이슬란드"
ice.9996.d:0 "1874년에 탄생한 아이슬란드는 덴마크가 식민지에게 자치와 헌법을 부여했을 때 처음으로 독립을 맛보았습니다. 덴마크의 일부로서, 아이슬란드는 세계대전 기간 동안 중립을 지켰습니다. 종전 이후 아이슬란드는 종주국 덴마크와 함께 미텔오이로파 경제블록과 합류했습니다. 이것은 아이슬란드가 주요 수출품인 어류로 두 시장에 진출할 수 있었기 때문에 이 섬나라에 번영의 시기를 가져다 주었습니다. 영국은 두 섬 사이의 거리 때문에 아이슬란드에서 수익성이 좋은 생선 수입을 계속했습니다. 한편, 아이슬란드 대구의 유럽 시장 진출은 아이슬란드 경제를 활성화시키기 위한 적은 추가 자금의 원천이 되었습니다."
ice.9996.a:0 "한때는 그랬지..."

ice.9997.t:0 "1925년 아이슬란드"
ice.9997.d:0 "그러나 이러한 경제적 번영은 영원히 지속되지 않았습니다. 1925년 영국 혁명은 종전 후 아이슬란드가 겪고 있던 기적을 산산조각 냈습니다. 충성파가 제국 구석구석까지 달아나자 영국-아이슬란드 무역은 순식간에 물거품이 되었습니다. 대구 무역이 가능할 유일한 나라는 왕족들이 도망간 캐나다였지만 그들은 아이슬란드 무역 재개보다 더 시급한 경제 문제를 가지고 있었습니다. 그러므로, 미텔오이로파 경제 정책이 생디칼리즘 국가들과 어떤 무역도 할 수 없다고 명령한 이후 아이슬란드는 영국 혁명의 여파로 비틀거리고 있었습니다."
ice.9997.a:0 "이젠 아니야..."

ice.9998.t:0 "1932년 아이슬란드"
ice.9998.d:0 "이 나라에서 증가하기 시작한 대규모 실업률에 미봉책을 마련하기 위해, 국회는 사람들이 육체 노동 건설 프로젝트에 종사하도록 하기 위해 도시 일자리 증가 계획을 만들었습니다. 이것은 한동안 효과가 있었지만 결국 정부 내 정당들 사이에서 불화의 원인이 되었습니다. 1932년 11월 9일 시의회 회의에서 시의회는 그 사업의 추진에 대해 토론했습니다. 경제 불황이 여전히 아이슬란드를 괴롭히고 있다는 사실 때문에 이 계획이 그대로 유지될 것을 요구하며 건물 앞에서 폭동을 일으키기 위해 집단으로 도착한 사람들에게 이 소식이 전해졌습니다. 이 폭동은 구토우슬라구린으로 알려지게 되었고, 도시 일자리 증가 계획이 가까운 미래에 효력을 발휘하도록 했습니다."
ice.9998.a:0 "이 위기가 과연 끝날까?"

ice.9999.t:0 "1936년 아이슬란드"
ice.9999.d:0 "지난 10년은 아이슬란드 사람들에게 재앙이었지만, 여전히 지평선 너머로 더 밝은 미래에 대한 희망이 남아 있습니다. 유망한 정부 관리들은 일자리를 제공하거나 관광 산업을 일으키거나 심지어 우리 섬이 우리에게 제공하는 지열과 수력 발전 자원을 활용하는 것을 검토하기 위해 대규모 공공 사업 계획을 짜기 시작했습니다. 아마도 덴마크의 약간의 도움을 받으면, 우리는 이러한 꿈을 이룰 수 있을 것입니다!"

ice.2.t:0 "아이슬란드가 어장을 확장하다"

The commander of the RNS Dunedin ordered his ship to ram the Ægir to protect their fishing vessel. After two ram attempts, the Ægir was barely left upright hanging on by a single screw. In an act of desperation, the commander of the Ægir gave the order to man the guns, in spite of the overwhelming firepower advantage that the Dunedin had at her disposal. Serviceman Guðmundur Kjærnested manned the 6 pounder to deter the Dunedin from finishing the fleeing patrol vessel off.

Due to the lax nature of the recent conflict in the Atlantic, there seemed to be no real attempt to post adequate sentries to stand guard against something like this. As Holbrook surfaced he fired two salvoes of torpedoes into the HMCS Cumberland. The first salvo was ineffective, bouncing off the hull, but the second salvo ripped a massive hole into the starboard hull immediately causing it to list over and begin to flood.

ice.86.t:0 "Running a census"
ice.86.d:0 "With our commitment to aiding the rural population, we need an accurate account of where they are located and in what numbers.

#CWCS#

ice.150.t:0 "The state of the roads"
ice.150.d:0 "The infrastructure of Iceland has never been the top priority as most activities took place on the coast where the boat was the better form of transportation. As Iceland attempts to modernize, our backwards infrastructure really shows its age. What few roads that exist on the island are only seasonal and are in extremely poor condition."
ice.150.a:0 "We must do something about this"

ice.151.t:0 "Warm water piping"
ice.151.d:0 "A recent development in Iceland is the installation of warm water piping in certain parts of Reykjavik.

Many schools and hospitals in the city were the first buildings to receive hot water pipes, but the pipe system has started to make its way into peoples homes now. Soon the whole city will be able to draw a hot bath with ease due to our abundant thermal springs beneath our island."
ice.151.a:0 "May a warm bath, warm our spirits"

#Generic Events#

ice.170.t:0 "Geysir Donation"
ice.170.d:0 "Iceland is home to several hot water geysers which have a tendency to draw crowds due to their beautifully explosive nature. Previously, this geyser was hidden away and used as a business venture to earn money from any who wished to watch the geyser erupt.

ice.170.a:0 "A most generous donation"

ice.173.t:0 "Farming Communities"

ice.175.a:0 "An untapped spring"

ice.176.t:0 "Expansion of Vestmannaeyjar"
ice.176.d:0 "As the fishing industry grows, so too do the towns that support such businesses. While the harbour is too shallow for larger more modern vessels, the coastal town of Heimaey remains a crucial part of the cod fishing industry that is run off of the southern coast of Iceland. Already efforts are underway to streamline the transfer of catches from newer vessels to smaller ships that can bring the haul to the city for processing."

ice.177.t:0 "A modern fleet"
ice.177.d:0 "The smaller ships that we have used in the past can not hope to handle the amount of fish that Iceland needs to recover from Black Monday. We must invest in larger vessels that are better suited for keeping up with the demands of the modern era."

ice.251.t:0 "Independence Victory!"

ice.252.t:0 "Loyalty to Denmark"
ice.252.d:0 "No matter the economic crisis that has polarized many on the isle, Icelanders are not a rebellious people. We will do our part as a constituent of the Kingdom of Denmark to care for our corner of the realm without cutting ties with the rest. This has unfortunately had the effect of radicalizing part of the hardline independence wing."

As such, they came along into Mitteleuropa and they remained in general in a course with us. However, Iceland's position makes their Mitteleuropa membership less than ideal, and as such, the island declined over the years. Under the dissent that this caused, Icelandic politicians had expedited the referendum, and the Icelandic people elected to end our relationship. A republic will be declared in Reykjavik and Iceland has let us know that they no longer need our foreign ministry to treat Icelanders as if they were Danes."
ice.256.a:0 "So be it"

However, Iceland's position makes their Mitteleuropa membership less than ideal, and as such, the island declined over the years.

ice.300.t:0 "Restructuring the Banks"
ice.300.d:0 "The current situation in Iceland does not suit anyone as the banking system has completely failed following the disaster of Black Monday. Two camps have formed which argue too separate views for how the banks should be rebuilt. One group believes that the only way forward is through a strong centrally planned bank, while the other argues that a series of separate specialized banks are how the people of Iceland will recover best from this crisis. Which group should we endorse?"
