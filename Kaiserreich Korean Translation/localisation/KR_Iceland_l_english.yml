### Events ###
ice.1.t:0 "Fuel Shortage"
ice.1.d:0 "Due to the recent economic downturn the government cannot afford much needed fuel for our economy, mainly the fishing fleet."
ice.1.a:0 "Blast! No money!"
ice.2.t:0 "Deal with Iceland"
ice.2.d:0 "Due to the financial pressure that Iceland is under and the fact that they have very little fuel, it seems that this would be the best time to offer them a deal for fuel. We could use this as our first stepping stone to a longer deal that will benefit us."
ice.2.a:0 "Approach them with a deal!"
ice.2.b:0 "Not really the time."
ice.3.t:0 "Canadian Fuel for Rights"
ice.3.d:0 "The Canadians have approached us with a deal to bring much needed fuel into Iceland. We will need to give up some of our fishing rights off the coast of Greenland but we can avert a crisis."
ice.3.a:0 "Accept the deal!"
ice.3.b:0 "The price is too high."
ice.4.t:0 "Iceland Accepts"
ice.4.d:0 "Iceland has accepted the deal. We are in business and we may extend our fishing operations around coast of Greenland as well begin with plan to extend our influence over Iceland in order to make it base for future invasion of British isles."
ice.4.a:0 "Great News!"
ice.5.t:0 "Iceland Refuses"
ice.5.d:0 "Damn those Icelanders! They have refused our offer to supply them with fuel in return for them giving up fishing rights around the coast of Greenland. We must find other way to allow us to extend our influence over their island."
ice.5.a:0 "Too bad."
ice.6.t:0 "Royalist Meddle in Iceland"
ice.6.d:0 "The Royalists are using the Icelanders' fuel crisis to meddle in Iceland's affairs. This is obviously the first move in a plot to gain foothold on Iceland and use it as base for another foolish attempt to retake British isles. Republican navy was ordered on full alert in response to this threat..."
ice.6.a:0 "We need to keep our eyes on this."
ice.7.t:0 "The Fishermen Protest"
ice.7.d:0 "Fishermen have begun protesting against our decision to give up our fishing rights off the coast of Greenland, we were forced to accept in treaty we have signed with Canada. If they would only see reason..."
ice.7.a:0 "Blasted fishermen!"
ice.8.t:0 "Opposition Demands the End to the Deal"
ice.8.d:0 "The opposition part has demanded that we cancel the deal with Canada to address the concerns of the fishermen. If we cancel the deal we will be forced to look elsewhere for fuel but if we don't we will have to face a crisis at home."
ice.8.a:0 "We need that fuel!"
ice.8.b:0 "Cancel the deal."
ice.9.t:0 "Iceland cancels Deal"
ice.9.d:0 "Bowing to pressure at home, the Icelandic government has cancelled its controversial trade deal they had with Canada. This should be most unfortunate for the ambitions the Canadians have with Iceland..."
ice.9.a:0 "Too bad."
ice.9.b:0 "Interesting."
ice.10.t:0 "The Reykjavik Riots"
ice.10.d:0 "The refusal of the Icelandic government to cancel its controversial trade deal with Canada has led to large riots in Reykjavik called by opposition parties, socialists and various labour unions. They are demanding an immediate end to the trade deal regarding fishing right along the coast of Greenland as well as an end to unwelcomed Canadian meddling in Icelandic national affairs."
ice.10.a:0 "Damn those rioters!"
ice.10.b:0 "Interesting."
ice.11.t:0 "Modifying the Deal"
ice.11.d:0 "With all the riots in Reykjavik and our inability to restore order we are hoping to modify the deal with Canada so we can quell some of the dissent in the city. We have offered Canada the ability to station troops in Iceland to hopefully restore order."
ice.11.a:0 "Send the request."
ice.11.b:0 "We shall solve this on our own!"
ice.12.t:0 "Send the Troops to Iceland"
ice.12.d:0 "Iceland wishes to modify the treaty with us to gain the fishing rights back. In return they are offering us the ability to station our land, naval and air forces there. Just what we wanted..."
ice.12.a:0 "Accept their proposition."
ice.12.b:0 "Refuse such a proposal!"
ice.13.t:0 "Canadian Troops in Ireland"
ice.13.d:0 "The Canadian Royalists have used their deal with the government of Iceland to move their forces onto Iceland. There is no doubt that they will use the Island as a base for further incursions against the Union of Britain."
ice.13.a:0 "This is unacceptable!"
ice.13.b:0 "Excellent."
ice.13.c:0 "Interesting."
ice.14.t:0 "Blockading Iceland"
ice.14.d:0 "The Royalist incursion in Iceland is unacceptable. If we do not act now, while their control over island is tenuous and syndicalist movement in Iceland is still strong they solidify their control over island, making it permanent base for their further incursions against us. A blockade is probably the best approach to remove the Royalists and their influence from Iceland."
ice.14.a:0 "Go ahead with the blockade!"
ice.14.b:0 "We are not ready for this."
ice.15.t:0 "Britain blockades Iceland"
ice.15.d:0 "In protest to the changes to the Canadian trade treaty with Iceland, which allowed Canada to station troops on Iceland, the Syndicalist Union of Britain has set up a blockade around Iceland! Foreign trade ships are being turned back by the Syndicalist Navy."
ice.15.aa:0 "This is horrible!"
ice.15.ab:0 "We must respond!"
ice.15.ac:0 "Finally!"
ice.15.ad:0 "Interesting."
ice.16.t:0 "Responding to the Blockade"
ice.16.d:0 "We must respond to this contentious act. The King is demanding war but the PM is considering a more subtle approach that will avoid open conflict. What should we do?"
ice.16.a:0 "War with the Bastards!"
ice.16.b:0 "Covert operations will do."
ice.17.t:0 "The Crisis"
ice.17.d:0 "The blockade has caused a crisis in the cabinet and the members of the Popular Unity Party have demanded an election. The fisherman throughout the country have sided with the opposition. What should we do?"
ice.17.a:0 "Hold an election."
ice.17.b:0 "No elections!"
ice.18.t:0 "Icelands Opposition walks out"
ice.18.d:0 "After the failure of Icelands government to call an election, the Popular Unity Party and the Nationalist Party members left the government. Protests are mounting and several armed people have been seen outside of the government buildings."
ice.18.a:0 "This is trouble."
ice.18.b:0 "Interesting."
ice.19.t:0 "The People storm the Parliament"
ice.19.d:0 "The members of the Popular Unity Party and the Nationalist Party have agitated the crowd into a near frenzy. The protesters have stormed the government buildings and they are barely being kept out of the main assembly hall. Our MPs are convening to the sound of the Revolution."
ice.19.a:0 "Ask Canada for help!"
ice.19.b:0 "We can take care of this!"
ice.20.t:0 "Icelands Government asks for Help"
ice.20.d:0 "With the violence of the protests, and what could possibly be Union involvement, the Icelandic government has asked us to send in our troops to quell the uprising. The King is anxious to support the government but the PM would like to avoid an open conflict on the island."
ice.20.a:0 "Send in the troops!"
ice.20.b:0 "Refuse their request."
ice.21.t:0 "Canadian Troops enter Reykjavik"
ice.21.d:0 "In accordance with an Icelandic request for help against a popular uprising, the government of Canada has sent elements of its armed forces to support the Icelandic government."
ice.21.a:0 "Excellent!"
ice.21.b:0 "We have to do something!"
ice.21.c:0 "Interesting."
ice.22.t:0 "Intervention in Iceland"
ice.22.d:0 "The Icelandic government has requested the Royalists' help in putting down the just cause of the people of Iceland. We must act for the workers."
ice.22.a:0 "Help the workers of Iceland!"
ice.22.b:0 "The workers will triumph without our help."
ice.23.t:0 "No Canadian Intervention in Iceland"
ice.23.d:0 "The Icelandic governments' request for aid from Canada has been denied. The Royalist troops are leaving and the protesters have seized most of Iceland. Most government officials are, together with their Canadian advisers, on board to Ottawa."
ice.23.a:0 "Horrible!"
ice.23.b:0 "We have to do something!"
ice.23.c:0 "Interesting."
ice.24.t:0 "Canadians triumph in Reykjavik"
ice.24.d:0 "The Canadian troops sent to Iceland have been able to secure Reyjavik from opposition and protesters. Neither the workers nor the Icelandic government will forget this."
ice.24.a:0 "Back to business!"
ice.24.b:0 "Terrible news!"
ice.24.c:0 "The Syndicalists lose again."
ice.25.t:0 "Protesters triumph in Reykjavik"
ice.25.d:0 "The alliance between opposition and protesters on Iceland have been able to capture Reyjavik. They are now building a new, Syndicalist country."
ice.25.a:0 "Time to pack..."
ice.25.b:0 "The workers triumph again!"
ice.25.c:0 "The Syndicalists triumph again."
ice.26.t:0 "Canadian and British forces clash"
ice.26.d:0 "Both Canada and Britain have intervened in the ongoing struggle in Reykjavik, meaning that for the first time since the Revolution of 1925 Syndicalist and Royalist units are actively fighting each other. The British are helping the opposition while Canadian forces are supporting government forces. There seems to be a lot of firing and only time will tell who wins this battle."
ice.26.a:0 "Keep your fingers crossed..."
ice.26.b:0 "Keep your fingers crossed..."
ice.27.t:0 "Canadian Troops win"
ice.27.d:0 "After a brief skirmish with British forces the Canadian troops have won the day and helped us secure Iceland. A marvellous turn of events."
ice.27.a:0 "Back to business!"
ice.28.t:0 "Royalists seize Iceland"
ice.28.d:0 "Our forces have been defeated by the Royalists. They have obviously used some sort of trickery to do this, but the facts are we are out and must respond. Some demand war, others think we should leave."
ice.28.a:0 "Burn them out!"
ice.28.b:0 "Raise the blockade..."
ice.29.t:0 "British Troops win"
ice.29.d:0 "After a brief skirmish with British forces the Canadian troops have been pushed back and the British forces are helping the opposition and protesters secure government buildings. All is lost."
ice.29.a:0 "Pack your bags."
ice.30.t:0 "Canadian Forces Fail"
ice.30.d:0 "The Government of Iceland has been defeated by protesters supported by parts of the Union forces despite our continuous support and are being forced to retreat. We must either avenge this humiliation or helplessly watch as yet another country falls to the Syndicalist scum."
ice.30.a:0 "Burn them out!"
ice.30.b:0 "It is too risky..."
ice.31.t:0 "A new government for Iceland"
ice.31.d:0 "We are now in a position to install our own type of government in Iceland. However, there is a conflict in our upper circles: The King believes that we should side with the Icelandic Nationalist Party to ensure that Iceland remains free of socialist influence. The PM, meanwhile, is hesitant to back an extreme party like that and believes we should not interfere and allow Iceland to remain a democracy."
ice.31.a:0 "The King is right."
ice.31.b:0 "Side with the PM!"
ice.32.t:0 "A new government for Iceland"
ice.32.d:0 "We are now in a position to install our own type of government in Iceland. However, there is a conflict in our upper circles: The Maximists obviously believe that we should ensure that Iceland remains free of Royalist influence by using our new influence over Iceland to ensure a Syndicalist government gets into power. The Autonomists, meanwhile, are hesitant to compromise a young democracy in such a fashion and want to let the Icelandic workers elect their own representation."
ice.32.a:0 "Side with the Maximists!"
ice.32.b:0 "The Autonomists are right."
ice.33.t:0 "The Icelandic Election"
ice.33.d:0 "Now that the recent Crisis has finally been resolved and the peace has been restored - with a little support from our new allies, of course, it is time to hold an election to legitimise a new government. This process will obviously be totally democratic and absolutely free."
ice.33.aa:0 "Support the Progressive Party."
ice.33.ab:0 "Side with the Popular Unity Party!"
ice.33.ac:0 "Elect the Independence Party."
ice.33.ad:0 "Hail the Nationalist Party!"
ice.34.t:0 "The People Take the Government"
ice.34.d:0 "With the help of the workers of Britain, the Popular Unity Party has taken control of Iceland."
ice.34.a:0 "The Glory of the Workers!"
ice.35.t:0 "The new Government"
ice.35.d:0 "The Canadian government has installed the Nationalist Party in Iceland. The strong presence of this party will allow Iceland to hopefully prosper in the face of Socialist agitation."
ice.35.a:0 "Hail the Nationalists!"
