CHI_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "Guangdong Type 88"
CHI_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "Originally a product of late Guangxu era 'Self Strengthening' efforts, the Type 88 was designed as a close copy of the German Gewehr 88 with export modifications. While collectively inferior to newer rifles despite improvements, and often poorly maintained, the weapon is known to be rugged and reliable if unwieldy.\n\nThis variety is mainly produced at the Guangdong Arsenal, though equipment shortages and personal preference often see it used alongside non-standard weapons such as the Daodao."
CHI_infantry_equipment_1:0 "Type 26"
CHI_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "Guangdong Type 27"
CHI_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "Originally called the 'Xuantong Type 27', this rifle was put into Qing service in 1935 through German assistance after the Restoration. The weapon is functionally a near copy of the German Mauser M1924, and a considerable improvement over the much older Type 88 in terms of weight and recoil.\n\nFirst produced at the Hanyang arsenal with German tools, manufacturing methods have already spread to Guangdong, though it may not fully replace its predecessors for some time."
CHI_infantry_equipment_2:0 "Tsingtao MP18"
CHI_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "Tsingtao MP18"
CHI_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "Thanks to the flood of Weltkrieg surplus into the world market in the early 1920s, the MP18 saw action in China some time before a modified version began production in Tsingtao.\n\nWith changes to the magazine and stock, this particular product of Sino-German cooperation has been copied and sold throughout Northern and Southern China, though primarily to the Qing Government."

CHI_infantry_equipment_3_short:0 "Liu Type 2"
CHI_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The General Liu Rifle, originally produced in small quantities in 1916, represented China's first independent foray into modern arms design, but unfortunately never made its way into full-scale production due to the death of its designer.\n\nThe weapon itself was by most accounts impressive for its time, and the superintendant at the Hanyang Arsenal has proposed that its design might be updated and issued as the 'Liu Type 2'."

ENG_submarine_1_desc:0 "L급은 중형함으로서 1938-1943년 공화국 해군성 조선 프로그램에 이전 잠수함 함급의 개선된 모습으로 설계되었습니다. 대전 말기에 건조되어 신형의 대구경인 21인치 어뢰를 장착했습니다. 이는 1930년대와 1940년대의 현대화 계획 이후로도 운용되었습니다."
ENG_submarine_2:0 "T급"
ENG_submarine_2_desc:0 "토급 혹은 트리턴급은 O, P 그리고 R급 대형 잠수함을 대체하기 위해 설계되었습니다. 적당한 크기를 가진 이 잠수함은 대서양과 태평양의 장거리 항해에 적합했습니다. 이 함선은 잘 무장되고, 안정적인 플랫폼을 가지고 있었으며 현 시기의 전반적인 충돌에 광범위하게 사용되었습니다."
ENG_submarine_3:0 "U급"
ENG_submarine_3_desc:0 "U급은 소형 잠수함으로 1938-1943년 공화국 해군성 조선 프로그램 때 건조되었습니다. 본래는 훈련용 잠수함으로 설계되었지만 전쟁이 발발함에 따라, 설계가 변경되어, 이 잠수함이 북해와 지중해같은 제한된 수역에서 유용함을 증명했습니다. 작은 크기로 인해, 작전 거리와 무장는 제한되었습니다. Undine, Umpire와 Uproar라는 세 개의 하위 함급이 하나의 함급을 이뤘습니다."

### Destroyers ####
ENG_destroyer_1:0 "V/W급"
ENG_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admiralty and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the Republican Admiralty shipbuilding programs of 1938-1943. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First Weltkrieg, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WK1 and became the backbone of the Republican Navy's destroyer flotillas after the 1925 revolution. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
ENG_destroyer_2:0 "G/H/I급"
ENG_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes is the same as in the F class, with both using the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
ENG_destroyer_3:0 "J/K/N급"
ENG_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasising gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
ENG_destroyer_4:0 "사크급"
ENG_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Sark-class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war. The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels."

### Light Cruisers ###
ENG_light_cruiser_1:0 "C급"
ENG_light_cruiser_1_desc:1 "C-class light cruisers were a group of light cruisers built before and during the First Weltkrieg for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions."
ENG_light_cruiser_2:0 "요크급"
ENG_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The York-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the German Emden-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armoured, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
ENG_light_cruiser_3:0 "버밍엄급"
ENG_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Birmingham-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armoured but because of their smaller engines, their range is somewhat reduced."
ENG_light_cruiser_4:0 "런던급"
ENG_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Birmingham class, incorporating war modifications that were authorised in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Birmingham class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets."

### Heavy Cruisers ###
ENG_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "호킨스급"
ENG_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armour belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection."
ENG_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "에섹스급"
ENG_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Essex-class heavy cruisers were the first class of Heavy Cruisers built by the Union of Britain followed the revolution in 1925. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they had been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armour, and more powerful engines."
ENG_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "컴벌랜드급"
ENG_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Cumberland-class heavy cruisers were an attempt by the Republican Navy to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armour, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
ENG_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "서머셋급"
ENG_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Somerset Class was designed during the 1940s to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armour. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships."

### Battle Cruisers ###
ENG_battle_cruiser_1:0 "레볼루션급"
ENG_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Revolution-Class, also called the Renown Class, were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WKI. Following the revolution, the new Republican Navy managed to restart their construction as battle cruisers. These ships were the quintessential battle cruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armour and a shorter operational range."
ENG_battle_cruiser_2:0 "인빈서블급"
ENG_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Invincible were a class of battle cruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the Blake-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Republican Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armour would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."

### Battleships ###
ENG_battleship_1:1 "리벤지급"
ENG_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts. While similarly armed and armoured, their considerably lower speed relegated them to secondary duties during WWII. Of the envisioned 8 ships of the class, only 5 were finished."
ENG_battleship_2:0 "블레이크급"
ENG_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Blake-class battleships were the first Battleships that the Republican Navy designed. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-calibre cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller calibre, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. They were designed to replace the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships that were used by the old regime."
ENG_battleship_3:0 "릴번급"
ENG_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lilburne-class battleships were the follow-up class to the Blake battleships, incorporating many of their features. The vessels are similar to the Black-Class ships, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have had thicker armour and more powerful engines."
ENG_battleship_4:0 "페어팩스급"
ENG_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Fairfax-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Republican Navy. Ordered under the Republican Admiralty shipbuilding programs of 1938-1943, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament is the same as the Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armour made the vessel fast and well protected."

### Super Heavy Battleships ###
ENG_SH_battleship_1:0 "윈스탠리급"
ENG_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Winstanley is a class of heavy battleships of the Republican Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German navy. Large 18 in. guns and thick armour provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the seas around the Union of Britain."
ENG_SH_battleship_2:0 "섹스비급"
ENG_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Sexby-Class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armour plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."

### Carriers ###
ENG_carrier_1:0 "오언급"
ENG_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battle cruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Republican Navy. Their conversions came about following the revolution in 1925. They were moderately-armoured but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement is limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Republican Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
ENG_carrier_2:0 "베전트급"
ENG_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Besant aircraft carrier was the first proper aircraft carrier to be built by the Republican Navy. She is the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel is well-armoured and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the forces of the Republican Navy."
ENG_carrier_3:0 "월러스급"
ENG_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Wallas class was designed to be an armoured aircraft carrier. Due to the armouring on the ship it limited the size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armoured flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armour and AA weaponry provided a strong defence for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
ENG_carrier_4:0 "모리스급"
ENG_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Morris-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Wallas class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armour on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Wallas class."

The first one eventually became known as Panzerkampfwagen III, which was to be a standard tank for the three light companies of a tank battalion. The second one became known as Panzerkampfwagen IV."

However, with the flaws of pre-war doctrine becoming apparent and in the face of Soviet T-34 tanks, the Panzer IV soon assumed the tanks-fighting role of its increasingly obsolete cousin. The most widely manufactured and deployed German tanks of the Second Weltkrieg, the Panzer IV was used as the base for many other fighting vehicles."

HOL_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Named after the island Ambon, this design of heavy cruisers is proposed to replace the ageing 'Pantserschepen' (coastal defence ships) of the Netherlands. The design is to be heavily armed for its size, continuing the coastal defence ship tradition with 3 240mm guns proposed as main armament. As a consequence, these ships will be slow for a cruiser, but less so than the old Panterschepen."

IRE_gw_tank_equipment_desc:0 "The Sturmpanzerwagen A7V was a German tank used extensively during the Weltkrieg, first deployed in 1918. After the end of the war, Germany sent several of these slow-moving armoured behemoths to Ireland when they had become obsolete. They were used to crushing effect in the Unionist uprising of 1925."

IRE_light_tank_equipment_1:0 "Pearse ILA-34"
IRE_light_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Pearse L-34"
IRE_light_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Named after the revolutionary leader Patrick Pearse, who died in the Easter Rising of 1916. The Pearse I was the first real Irish attempt at producing their own line of armour, and owed much to the German WK1 tanks delivered to them during peace time."
IRE_light_tank_equipment_2:0 "Wolfe ILA-36"
IRE_light_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Wolfe L-36"
IRE_light_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Wolfe light tank was designed in 1936 as a considerable upgrade to the previous Pearse tank built in '34. Named after the father of Irish republicanism, Wolfe Tone, the Wolfe was a quick and nimble tank that packed a punch despite it's size."

IRE_light_tank_equipment_3_short:0 "Emmet L-41"
IRE_light_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Produced in 1941, the Emmet light tank was the final Irish effort to produce a modern light tank for use in WK2. Faster than the prior two iterations and better armoured, it lacked the punching power of the heavier Collins or Savage models, but made up for it by being cheaper to produce and more flexible."
IRE_medium_tank_equipment_1:0 "O'Connell IMA-39"
IRE_medium_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "O'Connell M-39"
IRE_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The O'Connell IMA-39 was the first in a new series of medium tank designs created by the Irish Republican Army. Much more heavily armoured than the lighter designs and with more firepower, the IMA-39 was still a highly mobile tank. Irish tanks were renown for being highly cost-effective, and the O'Connell continued this trend."

IRE_medium_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Collins M-41"
IRE_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Collins IMA-41 was a sturdy and effective medium tank design created by the Irish Republican Army to serve as a front line battle tank in WK2. Named after Irish hero (and President of Ireland at the time) Michael Collins, the tank served effectively in the European theatre of the war."

IRE_heavy_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Fionn H-34"
IRE_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Affectionately nicknamed a 'big clunky bastard' by General Richard Mulcahy, the 1934 produced heavy tank Fionn was Ireland's first real foray into the post-GW heavy tank era. As it's nickname suggested, it had woeful reliability scores, but it did later prove to have some use during WK2."
IRE_heavy_tank_equipment_2:0 "Savage IHA-41"
IRE_heavy_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Savage H-41"
IRE_heavy_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The aptly named Savage was one of the most advanced tank designs produced and tested by Ireland during WK2. Few were made due to their prohibitive industrial cost, but the Savage packed a ferocious punch and was known for it's high reliability despite being a heavy tank design."

IRE_heavy_tank_equipment_3:0 "Cormac IHA-43"
IRE_heavy_tank_equipment_3_short:0 "Cormac H-43"
IRE_heavy_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Ireland's final pre-modern iteration of the heavy battle tank, the Cormac offered superior protection and firepower to the Savage but struggled to hold it's own weight, and regularly encountered engine problems. Very few were built, and they were viewed as 'smouldering death traps' more often than not by Irish tankers."

IRE_super_heavy_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Lugh SH-43"
IRE_super_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Named after a legendary Irish hero, the Lugh was a new generation of super-heavy battle tank theorised towards the end of WK2. Only a few models ever saw production due to the massive cost it took to produce them, but it is unlikely that the Cormac would ever have seen widespread use in battle even if it had come earlier in the war. Like many super-heavy tanks, it was simply too unreliable."
IRE_modern_tank_equipment_1:0 "Morrigan IMBT-45"
IRE_modern_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Morrigan BT-45"
IRE_modern_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "With the production of the Morrigan main battle tank, Ireland left the WK2 era of tanks behind and began production of the so-called modern tank, a mobile weapons platform that offered all of the advantages of older tank designs but built with performance and flexibility in mind."

### Sea ###
IRE_submarine_1:0 "Holland Class"
IRE_submarine_1_desc:0 "Named after the Irish engineer who developed the first U-boat formally commissioned by the U.S Navy, the Holland Class is an early Irish attempt into the secretive world of U-boat warfare. It had numerous issues and saw very little actual service, but proved a useful platform to build on for future members of the U-boat family."
IRE_submarine_2:0 "Wolfhound Class"
IRE_submarine_2_desc:0 "The feared Wolfhound Class of U-boat proved to be a terror of the Irish sea during WK2. Commissioned explicitly on the orders of Michael Collins, who feared that a war with the Union of Britain might destroy his nation, the Wolfhound was a cheap yet powerful U-boat that carried an expansive arsenal of 8 torpedo tubes and made full use of the experimental Marfóir torpedo."
IRE_submarine_3:0 "Banshee Class"
IRE_submarine_3_desc:0 "A latter expansion upon the design of the Wolfhound, the Banshee was a larger U-boat that could operate at deeper levels and stay undetected. It was so named in honour of the female Irish fighter pilots who kept the skies above the Irish Sea safe whilst the Banshee did the same beneath the surface. Its scream may have often been silent, but it was no less deadly."
IRE_submarine_4:0 "Kelpie Class"
IRE_submarine_4_desc:0 "The most advanced U-boat of its kind during WK2, the Kelpie was a joint venture between German and Irish engineers, and had a much longer range than the previous designs, which were typically deployed in the Irish Sea and the Atlantic. The Kelpie could reach far further shores, and could conduct long-range trade warfare that posed a major threat to the Entente powers in particular."

IRE_SH_battleship_2:0 "Bánánach Class"
IRE_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "Bigger, badder, and even more expensive to produce than the Balor, the Bánánach boasts a main armament of 12 x 18'/50 calibre guns to offer almost unmatched firepower relative to other Irish designs."

ITA_submarine_1:0 "Mameli Class"
#ITA_submarine_1_desc:0 "The Geoffredo Mameli class is a class of medium submarines of the Regia Marina launched between 1926 and 1928. They displaced just under 800 tons and had a diving depth of 100m. They were the basis for subsequent models such as the Pisani, Bandiera, and Squalo classes."
#ITA_submarine_1b: "Bandiera Class"
#ITA_submarine_1c: "Sirena Class"
ITA_submarine_2:0 "Perla Class"
#ITA_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Perla-class and Adua-class submarines were built in the 1930s. They were the third and fourth sub-classes of the 600 Series of submarines built by Italy. They were smaller than their predecessors, displacing just over 600 tons."
#ITA_submarine_2b: "Marcello Class"
ITA_submarine_3:0 "Marconi Class"
#ITA_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Marconi class was a class of six submarines built between 1939 and 1940 and succeeded the earlier Luizzi submarines. The submarines of both classes displaced about 1,000 tons and had eight 533mm torpedo tubes. Only one ship of the two classes combined survived the war."
#ITA_submarine_3b: "Plantino Class"
ITA_submarine_4:0 "Pietro Calvi Class"
#ITA_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Pietro Calvi subclass involved only minor improvements over the preceding Flutto class, which was a class of medium-sized submarines. Only a handful were launched, as most hulls were captured by the Germans after the Italian armistice. A redesigned version of the Pietro Calvi was finally commissioned in 1961."
ITA_destroyer_1:0 "Curtatone Class"
#ITA_destroyer_1_desc:0 "Curtatone-class destroyers were the first destroyers to be built in Italy after the end of World War I and were the first destroyers to use twin gun mountings. The ships were originally ordered at the same time as the Palestro class destroyers, but were postponed due to steel shortages. They displaced just under 1,000 tons and mount four 102mm Schneider-Armstrong guns."

ITA_destroyer_2:0 "Soldati Class"
#ITA_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Soldati class were a group of destroyers built in the late 1930s. There were two batches. Twelve ships made up the first batch in 1938-39. Five ships were completed in the second batch in 1941-42. The first batch displaced just over 1,800 tons and was armed with four 120mm Ansaldo guns."
ITA_destroyer_3:0 "Ciclone Class"
#ITA_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Ciclone-class destroyers were designated as torpedo boats but were really more of a destroyer escort. They were slightly enlarged versions of the previous Orsa class, displacing over 1,100 tons, and had improved stability and heavier anti-submarine armament."

#ITA_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Comandanti Medaglie d'Oro class were a group of destroyers planned for the Regia Marina but never launched by the time of the Italian Armistice. The ships were significantly larger than previous Italian destroyers, displacing nearly 2,100 tons. They were also armed with the larger, 135mm Ansaldo guns and had improved engines."
ITA_light_cruiser_1:0 "Taranto Class"
#ITA_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The cruisers Taranto and Bari were World War I-era cruisers obtained from Germany as reparations. Both displaced between 4,500 and 5,100 tons and were armed with German 150mm SK/45 guns."

They were built before World War II to gain predominance in the Mediterranean Sea. They were the largest Italian light cruisers commissioned during the war, displacing over 9,400 tons. They were well-armored and mount ten 152mm Ansaldo guns."
ITA_light_cruiser_3:0 "Capitani Romani Class"
#ITA_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Capitani Romani light cruisers were essentially designed to outrun and outgun the large new French destroyers of the late 1930s. Twelve hulls were ordered in late 1939, but only three were completed before the Italian armistice in 1943. They were lightly armored and displaced only 3,700 tons, but were quite fast. They mount eight 135mm OTO/Ansaldo guns."
ITA_light_cruiser_4:0 "San Marco Class"
#ITA_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The San Marco class is an improved version of the earlier Capitani Romani light cruisers. Due to the Italian armistice the San Marco, and her redesigned sister ship the San Giorgio, were not commissioned until the 1950s."
ITA_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Trento Class"
#ITA_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Trento class was a heavy cruiser design of the Regia Marina from the late 1920s. They were the first ships designed specifically to the limitations of the Washington Naval Treaty, which limited cruisers to 10,000 tons and 8 in. guns. The last ship of the class, the Bolzano, was an improved design launched in 1932."

Altogether 42 Kaichu type U-boats were built for the IJN and the series included 7 variants."
JAP_submarine_1:1 "카이다이 III급"
JAP_submarine_1_desc:1 "The Kaidai type U-boat (Kaidai-gata sensuikan) was a type of 1st class U-boat operated by the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) before and during World War II. The type name, was shortened to Kaigun-shiki Ōgata Sensuikan. The nine Kaidai IIIs were based on earlier designs, but featured a strengthened hull. The "IIIb" types were 40 cm longer and had a different bow design. All nine boats were constructed between 1927 and 1930."
JAP_destroyer_pre:1 "모미급"
JAP_destroyer_pre_desc:1 "The Momi class was a development of the Enoki second-class destroyers, relying on the same basic hull. They were quite small, comparable to Royal Navy corvettes. The design incorporated features discovered on German destroyers captured during World War I, including a lengthened forecastle with a break forming a well deck immediately forward of the bridge. This arrangement, apparently derived from contemporary torpedo boat practice, offered the advantage of a low, semi protected area for the forward torpedo tubes albeit at the cost of becoming awash in heavy seas. Initial problems with stability during high-speed turns were later corrected by widening the beam and bringing up the waterline."
JAP_light_cruiser_pre:1 "스마급"
JAP_light_cruiser_pre_desc:1 "While more lightly armed and armoured than many of its contemporaries, their small size and relatively simple design facilitated their construction and their relatively high speed made them useful for many military operations.

JAP_heavy_cruiser_pre_desc:1 "The Izumo-class cruisers were a pair of armoured cruisers built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) in the late 1890s. As Japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships herself, the vessels were built in Britain. They were part of the 'Six-Six Fleet' expansion program that began after the defeat of China during the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95. The sister ships participated in three of the four main naval battles of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05—the Battle of Port Arthur, the Battle off Ulsan and the Battle of Tsushima—but played a much more minor role in World War I."

Construction began during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 and their design was influenced by the IJN's experiences during the war. The British development of the battlecruiser the year after Tsukuba was completed made her and her sister ship Ikoma obsolete, as they were slower and more weakly armed than the British, and later German, ships. Despite this, they were reclassified in 1912 as battlecruisers by the IJN."

Nagato, the lead ship of the class, frequently served as a flagship. Both ships carried supplies for the survivors of the Great Kantō earthquake in 1923. They were modernised in 1933–36 with improvements to their armour and machinery and a rebuilt superstructure in the pagoda mast style."
JAP_carrier_pre:1 "호쇼급"
JAP_carrier_pre_desc:1 "Hōshō, literally 'phoenix in flight' was the world's first commissioned ship that was designed and built as an aircraft carrier, and the first aircraft carrier of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN). Commissioned in 1922, the ship was used for testing carrier aircraft operations equipment, techniques, such as take-offs and landings, and carrier aircraft operational methods and tactics. The ship provided valuable lessons and experience for the IJN in early carrier air operations. Hōshō's superstructure and other obstructions to the flight deck were removed in 1924 on the advice of experienced aircrews."
JAP_carrier_1_desc:1 "The aircraft carrier Kaga was one of Japan's first fleet carriers. She was originally a battleship, but finished as an aircraft carrier.

OTT_battle_cruiser_pre:1 "Yavuz Class"
OTT_battle_cruiser_pre_desc:1 "The Yavuz-class is a licenced copy of the German Moltke-class battlecruisers. During the Weltkrieg, the Moltke-class SMS Goeben was transferred to the Ottoman Navy and renamed the Yavuz Sultan Selim, effectively founding the class. After the war, the Ottomans purchased a licence to produce additional Yavuz-class battlecruisers."

OTT_battle_cruiser_1:1 "Oruç Reis Class"
OTT_battle_cruiser_1_desc:1 "The Oruç Reis class is a fairly typical battlecruiser of the post-Weltkrieg era. It is heavily based on the preceding Yavuz-class, with the twin wing turrets replaced by a second super-firing front turret, allowing the same weight of fire in a broadside volley while saving significant weight."

OTT_battle_cruiser_2:1 "Piri Reis Class"
OTT_battle_cruiser_2_desc:1 "The Piri Reis class was designed with economy in mind, given the Empire's increasing economic difficulties. Wherever possible, non-critical elements were to be made from cheaper materials, and many crew conveniences were reduced or deleted. Nonetheless, the combat capabilities of the Piri Reis class were not skimped on, and it is easily in the same league as modern battlecruisers in foreign navies."

OTT_battle_cruiser_3:1 "Aydın Reis Class"
OTT_battle_cruiser_3_desc:1 "After the sacrifices made in the design of the Piri Reis class led to widespread discontent and borderline mutiny among naval personnel, and the more frequent maintenance and replacement of substandard parts negated the initial cost savings, the Aydın Reis class abandoned the idea of being as cheap as possible. It is an ambitious design that incorporates many examples of modern, cutting-edge technology, so despite having broadside volley firepower no better than the Piri Reis or Oruç Reis class designs, heavy-duty autoloaders grant it a reload rate almost on par with that of a heavy cruiser, granting it significant overall firepower."

OTT_battle_cruiser_4:1 "Hızır Reis Class"
OTT_battle_cruiser_4_desc:1 "The Hızır Reis class is in some ways more conservative than the preceding Aydın Reis. It abandons the 28cm guns used by all Turkish battlecruisers up to this point, even with the powerful, but temperamental autoloaders used on the Aydın Reis, in favour of significantly larger, battleship-grade models. Five double 40.6cm gun turrets do give it less overall firepower than modern battleships, and a lower rate of fire than with the smaller 28cm guns, but its high speed and manoeuvrability, and respectable belt armour, compensate for these shortcomings, making the Yildirim a fast, deadly warship."

OTT_battleship_pre:1 "Reşadiye Class"
OTT_battleship_pre_desc:1 "The Reşadiye-class battleships were designed during the Weltkrieg, and have undergone significant modernisation since. They are heavily armed and armoured, with six twin 30cm centreline turrets giving a heavy broadside, and 16 150mm casemate guns providing close protection, but this design limited the available room for extra AA weaponry that could be added during refits."

OTT_battleship_1:1 "Kanuni Class"
OTT_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Kanuni-class battleships were a pair of ships designed during the later stages of the Weltkrieg. After the Treaty of Versailles, their construction was put on hold, and after the Peace with Honour both partially completed vessels were scrapped. Their design was quite modern for the era, with four twin 40.6cm turrets providing a heavy broadside volley, 12 150mm casemate-mounted secondary guns, and another 10 77mm open gun mounts, which could also be used against aircraft."

OTT_battleship_2:1 "Yıldırım Class"
OTT_battleship_2_desc:1 "The Yıldırım-class is an iteration on the Kanuni-class design, longer and wider to accommodate a fifth double turret, and with a reduced secondary casemate armament in favour of dual-purpose guns and small-calibre anti-aircraft turrets."

OTT_battleship_3:1 "Abdülhamid Class"
OTT_battleship_3_desc:1 "The Abdülhamid-class is a very modern battleship design, with three triple centreline turrets allowing for similar firepower to the Yıldırım-class in a shorter, more compact ship. Extra attention was given to the armour scheme and the torpedo protection, offering this ship excellent survivability. The casemate secondaries have been eliminated entirely, replaced by a larger number of 88mm dual-purpose guns."

OTT_battleship_4:1 "Abdülmecid Class"
OTT_battleship_4_desc:1 "After the shortcomings of the Abdülhamid-class became clear, the Abdülmecid-class was designed as a significantly longer ship, granting room to bring back the 150mm secondary guns, this time mounted in twin turrets, four to a side. The 88mm guns have received magazine feeding systems, and with eight single mountings and six triple turrets, all centrally guided by radar fire control, they can project a withering amount of defensive anti-air and anti-destroyer firepower."

OTT_SH_battleship_1:1 "Hümayun Class"
OTT_SH_battleship_1_desc:1 "Designed to take and deal heavy punishment, the Hümayun-class is an extravagantly expensive battleship design, boasting the thickest hull armour in the Ottoman Navy, and a deadly broadside from its four triple 40.6cm turrets. Despite its heavy close-range secondary armament, consisting of casemate-mounted guns, dual-purpose 88mm guns, and a blistering array of autocannons, the Hümayun still needs to be properly escorted, or aerial and U-boat threats will send her to the bottom."

OTT_SH_battleship_2:1 "Hanedan Class"
OTT_SH_battleship_2_desc:1 "The Hanedan-class is even larger and more powerful than the preceding Hümayun-class. She is a long, broad ship, barely able to pass through the Bosphorus, with a main armament of three triple 46cm gun turrets, two double 21cm secondary gun turrets, fourteen double 150mm dual-purpose turrets, and numerous magazine-fed single-mount and triple-turret 88mm guns, with one suite of radar fire control for the 46cm and 21cm guns and two additional ones for the smaller defensive armament. Despite all of this, her modern turbine engines make her faster than the Hümayun. As such, the papers have dubbed her the Sultan of the Seas."

OTT_carrier_pre:1 "Ertuğrul Class"
OTT_carrier_pre_desc:1 "After the Weltkrieg, the Ottoman Navy recovered the wreckage of the British seaplane carrier HMS Ben-my-Chree, repaired and refitted her, and returned her to active duty in 1925. Her new name comes from the artillery officer, Mustafa Ertuğrul Pasha, whose battery sank her off at Kızılhisar. The recovered seaplanes, though too heavily damaged to be put back into service, and the aircraft handling mechanisms were studied particularly intently, both by the Ottoman Navy and the Air Force, providing a solid foundation on which to base further development of naval aviation."

OTT_carrier_1:1 "Peyk-i Şeref Class"
OTT_carrier_1_desc:1 "Featuring a short runway on a converted hull, this aircraft carrier design is the Ottoman Navy's effort to catch up with competing naval aviation programs. It is armed with a 3cm Kuşçu AA gun, as well as several machine gun mounts, in order to defend itself against aerial threats."

OTT_carrier_2:1 "Âsâr-ı Tevfik Class"
OTT_carrier_2_desc:1 "The Âsâr-ı Tevfik class is a much larger design than its predecessors, with larger hangar capacity and a longer runway. While it is still a conversion design, based on naval transport ships, its capabilities are broadly comparable to the older purpose-built carriers of other navies. It was initially designed with a large array of 3cm Kuşçu guns, but these outdated weapons have been scrapped in favour of several modern 88mm dual-purpose guns, capable of firing on nearby naval targets as well, and a number of more modern autocannon mounts. The engines of the transport ships converted to Âsâr-ı Tevfiks are also replaced with modern steam turbine designs."

OTT_carrier_3:1 "Muin-i Zafer Class"
OTT_carrier_3_desc:1 "The Muin-i Zafer class was originally planned as a seaplane carrier design; however, it quickly became clear that this type of ship is no longer suitable for main-line use in a modern navy. Instead, the Âsâr-ı Tevfik class conversion design was used as a base for a new purpose-built aircraft carrier, longer and more well-armoured than its predecessor, armed with a respectable number of 88mm Tophane guns, in addition to two experimental high-elevation dual-purpose 150mm gun mounts."

OTT_carrier_4:1 "Berk-i Satvet Class"
OTT_carrier_4_desc:1 "The Berk-i Satvet class is the most advanced carrier ever designed for the Ottoman Navy. She is slightly longer than the Muin-i Zafer class, several metres taller, and almost twice as wide, giving her a significantly increased hangar capacity as well as a powerful armament suite of three twin dual-purpose 150mm gun turrets and six triple 88mm turrets. She also has provisions for installing the experimental Kulak radar array, which, when development is finished, will greatly increase her effective spotting range and gun direction."

OTT_submarine_pre:1 "Çanakkale Class"
OTT_submarine_pre_desc:1 "The first Çanakkale-class U-boats were built late during the Weltkrieg. These U-boats have very good torpedo armament for their time, but their slightly underpowered engines and thin hull make them vulnerable."

OTT_submarine_1:1 "Tahtelbahir Class"
OTT_submarine_1_desc:1 "The Tahtelbahir-class U-boats are improved versions of the Çanakkale-class. This design was developed in the 1920s, fixing the problems that plagued its predecessor, while improving its attack capabilities with heavier, more modern torpedoes."

OTT_submarine_2:1 "Denizkızı Class"
OTT_submarine_2_desc:1 "The Denizkızı class breaks with the tradition of its predecessors by not focusing primarily on armament. It is a long, sleek design, with four frontal and two rear 533mm torpedo tubes, and a supercharged diesel engine that makes it one of the fastest U-boat designs in the world at the time of its design."

OTT_submarine_3:1 "Ay Class"
OTT_submarine_3_desc:1 "Largely an iteration on the preceding Denizkızı-class, the Ay-class is essentially a fatter version of the former, with thicker hull plating ensuring greater survivability, an extra two bow torpedo tubes, and a deck-mounted 88mm gun. Despite all this increased mass, the larger internal space allows for a larger engine too, which means it isn't any slower than its predecessor."

OTT_submarine_4:1 "Bozkurt Class"
OTT_submarine_4_desc:1 "The Bozkurt-class is a fairly unremarkable design overall. A further iteration of existing U-boat designs, improvements over the preceding Ay-class are mostly incremental. The addition of a more modern hydro-acoustic sonar system built under licence improves its ability to hunt other U-boats, at the cost of giving away its location to enemy U-boats and destroyers when in use. Besides this, the biggest change is the enlargement of the torpedo tubes from 533mm to 610mm."

OTT_destroyer_pre:1 "Taşoz Class"
OTT_destroyer_pre_desc:1 "The Taşoz-class was a development of the Durandal-class destroyers, relying on the same small basic hull. The design incorporated features discovered on German destroyers used during World War I, including a lengthened forecastle with a break forming a well deck immediately forward of the bridge. This arrangement, apparently derived from contemporary torpedo boat practice, offered the advantage of a low, semi protected area for the forward torpedo tubes albeit at the cost of becoming awash in heavy seas. Initial problems with stability during high-speed turns were later corrected by widening the beam and bringing up the waterline."

OTT_destroyer_1:1 "İzmir Class"
OTT_destroyer_1_desc:1 "The İzmir-class is a fairly standard late Weltkrieg destroyer design, with a light armament of three 77mm guns, a twin 533mm torpedo tube mounted in the well deck, and two more mounted further back, on the ship's centreline. Powerful turbine engines give it a high top speed. However, as with all destroyers, its armour protection is practically nonexistent."

OTT_destroyer_2:1 "Kostantiniyye Class"
OTT_destroyer_2_desc:1 "The Kostantiniyye-class is designed as more of a gunboat, with two triple centreline 533mm torpedo tubes but four twin 77mm guns on rapid motorised mounts. As destroyers go, it is a fairly compact design, intended for fast manoeuvres at high speed."

OTT_destroyer_3:1 "Bursa Class"
OTT_destroyer_3_desc:1 "While the Kostantiniyye-class may have been a strong design for hunting other destroyers, its smaller torpedo armament compared to its contemporaries limited its overall usefulness. As such, the Bursa-class has cut back on the number of guns, being only three single 88mm guns this time, but three triple centreline 610mm torpedo tubes firing extended-range torpedoes, and a lengthened rear deck with additional depth charge launchers compared to the Kostantiniyye-class."

OTT_destroyer_4:1 "Tekirdağ Class"
OTT_destroyer_4_desc:1 "The Tekirdağ-class is a modern design, featuring fully enclosed motorised high-elevation dual-purpose turrets for its three 88mm guns, and five triple torpedo launchers. With one mounted behind the wheelhouse, and two on each side of the ship's midsection, it cannot get all its torpedoes in the water against a single target without heavy manoeuvring, but it can carry more of them than other destroyers of similar size with centreline launchers."

OTT_light_cruiser_pre:1 "Midilli Class"
OTT_light_cruiser_pre_desc:1 "Originally Magdeburg-class light cruisers transferred from the German Hochseeflotte, starting with SMS Breslau, renamed Midilli. These ships' lighter armament than other contemporary cruisers, consisting of 12 105mm guns, was replaced with a more standard arrangement of 8 150mm guns in Ottoman service. Their small size and high speed made them useful as scout cruisers and blockade runners."

OTT_light_cruiser_1:1 "Kıbrıs Class"
OTT_light_cruiser_1_desc:1 "The Kıbrıs-class scout cruisers are late Weltkrieg designs intended for tracking Entente fleet movements in the Mediterranean and engaging targets of opportunity. To that end, they carried a fairly light 150mm gun armament, relying more on six twin side-mounted torpedo tubes for engaging any serious threats that they could not simply run away from. Their high-powered engines are maintenance-intensive, but they grant these ships a high cruise speed, and they can be pushed to their limits for brief periods if a rapid escape is called for."

OTT_light_cruiser_2:1 "Rodos Class"
OTT_light_cruiser_2_desc:1 "As land-based naval bombers and carrier-based naval aviation has become more and more common after the Weltkrieg, the Rodos-class was designed with an anti-air escort role in mind. Their primary armament is limited to six 150mm gun mounts, but they also carry ten high-elevation dual-purpose 77mm gun mounts and numerous autocannons and machine guns. Should they need to engage heavier surface ships, they can also still use their two triple torpedo launchers."

OTT_light_cruiser_3:1 "Girit Class"
OTT_light_cruiser_3_desc:1 "After the lessons of the Rodos-class, the Girit-class carries significantly more surface-to-surface firepower. However, as the main role of these ships is still anti-air, it only carries three twin 150mm turrets, with the remaining eight guns in somewhat outdated casemate mounts on the side of the ship. This leaves room on the deck and superstructure for four fully-enclosed motorised twin 88mm dual-purpose turrets and six more single 88mm gun mounts. Provisions are also made for mounting an air detection radar."

OTT_light_cruiser_4:1 "Marmara Class"
OTT_light_cruiser_4_desc:1 "With naval aviation becoming more prominent, and battleship anti-air suites more powerful, the role of the light cruiser as primarily an anti-air escort ship appears to be over. The Marmara-class still carries potent anti-air firepower, helped by the fact that its main 150mm armament is now also mounted in dual-purpose turrets, but its torpedo armament has also been significantly expanded in order to expand its role as an agile anti-surface combatant. Two quadruple torpedo launchers on each side complement five twin 150mm gun turrets and two triple 88mm turrets, with the usual autocannons rounding out its armament."

OTT_heavy_cruiser_pre:1 "Turgut Reis Class"
OTT_heavy_cruiser_pre_desc:1 "The Turgut Reis class is a heavy armoured cruiser design intended to accompany battleships in the battle line and engage smaller surface combatants like cruisers and destroyers while the capital ships slug it out. It carries a mixed primary armament of four 21cm guns, six 150mm guns, and eight 77mm guns. Its low speed is compensated for by its thick armour protection, allowing it to stand up to several battleship-calibre hits."

OTT_heavy_cruiser_1:1 "Mesudiye Class"
OTT_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:1 "The Mesudiye-class is a modern design for its time, carrying its eight main 21cm guns in four fully-enclosed superfiring turrets. However, despite carrying fewer smaller guns, this increased weight allocated to the armament means it does not boast armour as heavy as the Turgut Reis class."

OTT_heavy_cruiser_2:1 "Muavenet Class"
OTT_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:1 "The Muavenet-class was designed to bring heavy firepower to bear at a budget. It is small for a heavy cruiser, and carries lighter armament than most others, in the form of three double 21cm turrets and four enclosed 150mm turrets, but this lowers its displacement enough compared to other contemporary heavy cruisers that its speed, manoeuvrability, and armour are all above average, while the cost stays relatively low."

OTT_heavy_cruiser_3:1 "Kırım Class"
OTT_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:1 "More modern manufacturing techniques and assembly line construction allow the Kırım-class heavy cruisers to remain relatively low-cost, like their predecessor design, while offering increased combat capabilities. Five double 21cm turrets give it a very heavy broadside, but the awkward gun arrangement, with one forward turret, two superfiring rear turrets, and the remaining two turrets mounted amidships between the superstructure, means it has to fully expose its vulnerable side armour in order to get all guns firing at the same target."

OTT_heavy_cruiser_4:1 "Giray Class"
OTT_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:1 "The Giray-class does away with its predecessor's undesirable turret arrangement and instead uses three triple 21cm turrets to provide similar weight of fire in a more convenient manner. The addition of two of the new twin 150mm dual-purpose turrets significantly improve its anti-air firepower."

QIE_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "Originally a product of late Guangxu era 'Self Strengthening' efforts, the Type 88 was designed as a copy of the German Gewehr 88 with export modifications. While collectively inferior to newer rifles despite improvements, and often poorly maintained, the weapon is known to be rugged and reliable if unweildy.\n\nThis variety is mainly produced at the Hanyang Arsenal, the model's place of design, though equipment shortages often see it used alongside non-standard weapons."

The weapon is functionally a near copy of the German Mauser M1924, and a considerable improvement over the much older Type 88 in terms of weight and recoil.\n\nThis variety is mainly produced at the Hanyang Arsenal with German tools, though it may not fully replace its predecessors for some time."

RUS_destroyer_pre:0 "노비크급"
RUS_destroyer_1:0 "아르페이급"
RUS_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Orfey-class destroyers are an improved version of the previous Novik class. They feature a decent surface and AA armament for their size, a somewhat short range, but a good speed and a heavy torpedo armament. The succeeding Fidonisy and Izyaslav classes are further improved versions of this class with an increased main armament and hull size."
RUS_destroyer_2:0 "그녜브니급"
RUS_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Gnevny-class destroyers are an important part of the 1934-1937 shipbuilding program. The class itself is heavily influenced by the latest foreign projects and considered a successful design. Their weight is in the range of 1,600-2,000 tons, they are well-armed and have a decent AA and torpedo armament. Due to their powerful engines, they are fast but somewhat short-ranged vessels."
RUS_destroyer_3:0 "사브라지텔늬급"
RUS_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Soobrazitelnyi-class destroyers are an improved version of the previous Gnevny class. Their engines are redesigned and they have a stronger AA armament. They weigh between 1,900 and 2,400 tons, and their speed and range are similar to the Gnevny class."
RUS_destroyer_4:0 "스코리급"
RUS_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Skoryi class is a further improvement on the Soobrazitelnyi class. The increase in size and weight (2,500-3,100 tons) results in a more stable ship with an increased operational range. All ships are built as a modular design that results in rapid construction and deployment times. Their armament is the same as that of the previous Soobrazitelnyi class, but the main guns are housed in twin turrets instead of single turrets."

RUS_light_cruiser_1:0 "스베틀라나급"
RUS_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Svetlana-class cruiser, had her construction started before Second Patriotic war but the war defeat and the following revolution and civil war delayed the completion of the entire class. In the late 1920's, she was finally commissioned for the Russian Navy along with her half-sister Yaroslav. Those vessels were the first turbine-driven cruisers of the Russian Navy. They are heavily armed and well-armoured cruisers for ships of their time."
RUS_light_cruiser_2:0 "루슬란급"
RUS_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Ruslan-class light cruisers are a series of vessels, which are somewhat of a mix of older and more recent technologies. Using hulls of the Svetlana and Yaroslav classes as a base for the new project, the ship's construction costs were reduced. Equipped with six twin turrets of smaller, destroyer calibre guns and a decent AA armament they are suited for scouting and a destroyer flotilla leader role. The overall look of the ships bears similarities with the Oleg class cruisers."
RUS_light_cruiser_3:0 "카잘스키급"
RUS_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Kazarsky-class cruisers are based on the Oleg class cruisers and are included in the 1937-1943 shipbuilding program. As the first true modern light cruiser of the Russian navy, they carry a strong anti-surface and anti-air armament together with a decent torpedo armament. Overall, those are good ships with a thick armour, high speed, a good operational range, and a weight between 10,500 and 14,000 tons."
RUS_light_cruiser_4:0 "슬라바급"
RUS_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Slava-class cruisers are the most numerous cruisers of the Russian Navy and are improved versions of the preceding Kazarsky class. Compared to the Kazarsky's, they have the same armament, machinery and armour, but have an increased fuel capacity allowing for a bigger range, improved U-boat protection, an increased anti-aircraft battery, and a slightly better manoeuvrability. They are designed for the roles of convoy hunting and capital ship escorts."

RUS_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "야로슬라프급"
RUS_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Yaroslav-class cruisers are the half-sisters of the Svetlana-class and the first heavy cruisers of Russian Navy. Yaroslav was completed with a modified design that included larger-calibre 180mm guns and stronger AA armament. Because it is a rebuilt light cruiser, it's armour is thinner compared to the heavy cruisers of other navies."
RUS_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "올레그급"
RUS_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Oleg-class cruisers are the Russian Navy's first modern heavy cruisers. The design is based on the cancelled Interbellum Russian cruiser projects and is built as part of the 1937-1943 shipbuilding program. The ships are displaced between 7,700 and 9,200 tons. They are armed with new 180mm guns in 3 triple turrets and a solid AA battery. Their strong engines provide good speed and an acceptable operational range, while the armour belt is thin compared to other heavy cruisers."
RUS_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "알렉산드르 네프스키급"
RUS_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Alexandr Nevskyi-class heavy cruisers were designed in the late 1930's-early 1940's to counter similar vessels in neighbouring countries. The design called for a larger-sized vessel displacing between 15,500 and 17,000 tons. They are equipped with four triple 240mm cannons to fight off enemy cruisers, a heavy AA armament for self-defence, and a larger scout plane force to find the enemy. Their main tasks are scouting for enemy forces and convoy hunting."
RUS_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "드미트리 돈스코이급"
RUS_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Dmytryi Donskoy-class heavy cruisers are the development of the previous Alexandr Nevskyi class. Design studies started in 1943 and the final version emerged in 1945. The vessels feature 220mm cannons in 3 triple turrets and a strong AA armament. Displacement is at least 26,500 tons."

RUS_battle_cruiser_1:0 "이즈마일급"
RUS_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Ismail-class battlecruisers were class of four vessels authorised in 1914, just before Second Patriotic war. Their design was based on the Imperatritsa Mariya class battleships. They followed the contemporary Russian capital ship building practices of using four triple turrets to house the heavy main armament, strong secondary armament in casemates, and an overall flush-deck. They had a low profile with low draught to fight in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea. Like many Russian ships of this period, the outbreak of Second Patriotic war and the Russian Revolution delayed these ships from being finished in time."
RUS_battle_cruiser_2:0 "폴타바급"
RUS_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Poltava-class battlecruisers are authorised in the 1937-43 shipbuilding program and scheduled to be finished in the 1940's. The original design aimed for a large-sized modern heavy cruiser of 23,000 tons, but after information on the latest foreign battlecruiser vessels had arrived, the ships were redesigned to displace to 35,000 tons."

RUS_battleship_1:0 "세바스토폴급"
RUS_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Sevastopol-class battleships were Second Patriotic war-era battleships and the first Dreadnoughts to serve in the Imperial Russian Navy. Their design and turret layout served as the basis of all the succeeding battleship and battlecruiser classes. Only four ships survived the chaos of the Russian Revolution. They were modernised and refitted during the 1930's, resulting in a tall almost pagoda-like superstructure. They have modern electronics and a strong AA complement."
RUS_battleship_2:0 "블라디보스토크급"
RUS_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Vladivostok-class battleships are designed in the late 1930's to be part of Russian Ocean-Going Navy. The ships displace around 41,000 tons, are armed with nine 406mm cannons in 3 triple turrets, and a secondary armament of twelve 152mm guns. Its good AA armament and thick armour provide a strong defence against air and surface targets. The project elements are used in the Vladimir Monomakh-class battleships."
RUS_battleship_3:0 "페테르부르크급"
RUS_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Peterburg-class battleship is a design to match and counter any existing foreign battleships of any potential opponent country. Its nine 406mm cannons in 3 triple turrets are designed to provide adequate firepower, while its 130mm AA guns, thick armour, and large engines can ensure its survival in battle."
RUS_battleship_4:0 "모스크바급"
RUS_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Moskva-class battleships are intended to provide the Russian Navy with its primary firepower in the new era of naval warfare. They are fast, well-armed, and well-armoured vessels, which have taken all the best from previous Russian battleship projects. There are projects to equip battleships of that class with R-2 series ballistic missiles."

RUS_SH_battleship_1:0 "블라디미르 모노마흐"
RUS_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Vladimir Monomakh-class is authorised in the 1937-43 shipbuilding program for the rebuilding Russian Navy. The ships are planned with a standard displacement of 59,000 tons, three triple turrets carrying 406mm cannons, and a heavy secondary and AA armament. They also have strong engines to accommodate their very thick belt armour."
RUS_SH_battleship_2:0 "이반 그로즈니"
RUS_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Ivan Groznyi-class battleships are a modified and improved version of the previous Vladimir Monomakh-class. Compared to their predecessors, they carry four triple turrets of the same 406mm calibre cannons, thickened belt armour, a revised layout of secondary guns, and stronger AA armament to counter the increased threat from the carrier-based planes."

RUS_carrier_1:0 "Borodino Class"
RUS_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Borodino-class aircraft carrier is the direct conversion of the unfinished hull of her Ismail-class battlecruiser namesake. Due to the nature of conversion, the ship has a thick armour belt and strong anti-surface and AA armament for her time. A moderately-sized air group provides her fleet the necessary air cover. The project was not carried out until late 1930-s due to costs and the state of the Russian shipbuilding industry after the revolution and civil war."
RUS_carrier_2:0 "Azov Class"
RUS_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Azov-class aircraft carrier is a design to provide the Russian Navy air projection over its fleets. They are similar in size to the contemporary foreign classes but carry additional secondary guns against surface targets and adequate AA guns for air cover. The increased armour results in a slightly reduced air group compared to foreign counterparts."
RUS_carrier_3:0 "Narva Class"
RUS_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Narva-class carriers are designed in the late 1930's-early 1940's. They are planned to provide air cover for the new surface fleets ordered in the plan of Russian Ocean-Going Navy. The ships are planned to displace around 30,000 tons, have strong AA armament, good armour, and an adequate air group."
RUS_carrier_4:0 "Kronstadt Class"
RUS_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Kronstadt-class aircraft carriers are the improved versions of the previous Narva-class ships. Design studies finished in the 1945 resulting in a larger ship with thinner armour. The extra space is used to install stronger AA armament and provide for the ability to carry a larger air group."

RUS_submarine_1:0 "AG Class"
RUS_submarine_1_desc:0 "Amerikansky Golland (American Holland) class submarines were built in Canada, then delivered to Russia during Second Patriotic war, where they were finally assembled. They were the direct copy of the successful Holland type submarines. They were designed to be good sea boats well-armed for their time."
RUS_submarine_2:0 "Series V Shuka"
RUS_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Series V submarines of the Schuka class are the second-most numerous submarines of the Russian Navy. Their large number come from their deployment to the four fleets of the Russian state: Black Sea, Baltic, Northern and Pacific. They are medium-sized patrol submarines with good torpedo armament and seaworthiness."
RUS_submarine_3:0 "Series XIV Delfin"
RUS_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Series XIV submarines are large cruising submarines of the Russian Navy with extended range. They are essentially an improved version of the Series IV Pravda class. These submarines feature heavy armament of both surface guns and torpedoes. They have a long range but only satisfactory seaworthiness."
RUS_submarine_4:0 "Series XXV Kosatka"
RUS_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Series XXV submarines, are the development of the previous cruising submarines projects, created for Russian Navy.

SQI_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Type 6-5, named for its use of 6.5mm rounds, is a slightly modified copy of the Japanese Type 38 Arisaka originally produced by Yan Xishan's Taiyuan Arsenal.\n\nShanqing forces have since put the weapon to widespread use, though they lack Yan's more cordial relations with the Japanese and Fengtian Governments, and thus ammo is harder to come by. This factor, and personal preference, have seen it used alongside a variety of other weapons such as the Daodao."

The weapon is functionally a near copy of the German Mauser M1924, and a considerable improvement over the much older Type 88 in terms of weight and recoil.\n\nFirst produced at the Hanyang arsenal with German tools, manufacturing methods have already spread to Taiyuan, though it may not fully replace its predecessors for some time."

SWE_submarine_2:0 "Sjölejonet Class"
SWE_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Sjölejonet-class consisted of nine U-boats built between 1936 and 1942. They were medium-sized subs, displacing 580 tons, and their design was heavily influenced by the Dutch O-class U-boats. They were armed with six 533mm torpedo tubes and had a diving depth of 60m."

SWE_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
SWE_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Swedish U-class U-boats were a class of nine subs commissioned between 1942 and 1944. They were fairly small and relatively slow, displacing only 370 tons. They were armed with four 533mm torpedo tubes."

SWE_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Neptun class consisted of three medium-sized U-boats that were all commissioned in 1943. They were used primarily for mine laying duties. They displaced 550 tons and were armed with five 533mm torpedo tubes."

SWE_destroyer_1:0 "Ehrensköld Class"
SWE_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The two destroyers of the Ehrensköld class were completed in 1927, as the first modern destroyers for Sweden following World War I. They displaced just over 970 tons and were armed with three 120mm/44 K/45 guns and six 533mm torpedo tubes. They had a short range but good speed."

SWE_destroyer_2:0 "Göteborg Class"
SWE_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Göteborg-class consisted of six destroyers built between 1935 and 1942. They had a longer hull and improved machinery compared to their predecessors. They displaced just over 1,020 tons and had a main armament of 120mm/44 K/45 guns, and also six 533mm torpedo tubes. They had a limited range but excellent speed."

SWE_destroyer_3:0 "Visby Class"
SWE_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The four destroyers of the Visby class were all built between 1942 and 1944. They were similar to the earlier Göteborg class, but were larger, displacing over 1,130 tons. They also had improved engines, somewhat better range, and a strong ASW complement of equipment."

SWE_destroyer_4:0 "Öland Class"
SWE_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The two Öland-class destroyers represented a radical change from previous designs. They were launched and completed by the middle of the decade. They were large, displacing 1,880 tons. They were armed with four 120mm/45 M44 guns in their main armament, and had a strong AA, torpedo, and ASW complement. They were slightly slower than earlier destroyers, but had a significantly improved range."

SWE_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Fylgia was a relatively small armoured cruiser that was commissioned for the Swedish Navy in 1905. The performed mostly training duties during the war, and underwent an extensive refit in 1939-41. Prior to the refit, she displaced over 4,300 tons and was armed with six 152mm/45 K/50 M1903 guns in her main armament. She had good armour, but was relatively slow for a cruiser."

SWE_light_cruiser_2:0 "Gotland Class"
SWE_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Gotland class cruiser was an innovative design from the early 1930s that combined the hull of a cruiser with a deck for seaplanes equipped with a catapult for take-off.

SWE_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Göta Class"
SWE_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "With all Swedish coastal battleships having been built before or during the Weltkrieg it is high time to upgrade the navy with new equipment. The Göta class armoured cruiser is intended to fulfil this role, replacing the Äran and Sverige class coastal battleships."

SWE_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Norrland Class"
SWE_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Norrland class is developed as an answer to the increasing requirement of being able to maintain a naval presence outside the littoral zone. Longer and with an improved engine compared to previous ships it would make for a strong backbone of the Swedish Navy."

SWE_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Svea Class"
SWE_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Following the success of the Norrland class heavy cruiser the Svea class improves on the weapon systems of her predecessor. Large enough to brave the open sea but nimble enough to fully take advantage of the Swedish archipelagos the Svea class is uniquely suited to her home."

SWE_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Sverige Class"
SWE_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Sverige class consisted of three coastal battleships built for the Swedish Navy before the Weltkrieg. The ships more closely resembled heavy cruisers in both size (displacement of over 6,800 tons) and armament (four 283mm/44 K/45 M12 guns). The ships were relatively slow for a cruiser but were very well-armoured."

SWE_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Skandinavien Class"

SWE_battleship_2:1 "Kung Karl XII Class"
SWE_battleship_2_desc:1 "The continued development of our high-seas navy is required to protect ourselves from the outside powers. An independent Sweden must be able to match the powerful navies of the world to maintain our position."

SWE_battleship_3:1 "Drottning Kristina Class"
SWE_battleship_3_desc:1 "While air power is starting to dominate the seas the power of a heavily armed battleship cannot be understated. With new range-finding technology and heavy anti-air armament the battleship can still remain relevant."

SWE_battleship_4:1 "Kung Karl XIV Johan Class"
SWE_battleship_4_desc:1 "With the development of naval air war progresses at a fast pace it is clear that old ships simply cannot keep up with the new weapons and new ships must be built. If Sweden is to have battleships at all, it must be the best."

SWE_SH_battleship_1:1 "Vasa Class"
SWE_SH_battleship_1_desc:1 "Ever since the age of sail the force a country can project at sea has been a measurement of its standing in the world. To fully realise our position, we need to build the largest and most powerful ship to sail the sea."

SWE_SH_battleship_2:1 "Kronan Class"
SWE_SH_battleship_2_desc:1 "Named after the regal ship that was the largest warship of its time during the 17th century, the Kronan-class battleship is intended to be the final word in the world of heavy battleships."

SWE_carrier_1:1 "Wachtmeister Class"
SWE_carrier_1_desc:1 "Naval theorists predict that naval air power is the future, and while the Gotland class seaplane cruiser is a step in the right direction we need to take it further, designing a ship that is specialised in carrying airplanes. Due to this radical reorganisation, it is only fitting that such ships would carry the names of the greatest organisers of the Swedish Navy through history."

SWE_carrier_2:1 "af Trolle Class"
SWE_carrier_2_desc:1 "While early suggestions of a specialised "hangar-ship" has them being converted from existing keels of capital ships or freighters it is becoming apparent that any fully-fledged navy will need a ship designed keel-up for the role as a carrier."

SWE_carrier_3:1 "Fleming Class"
SWE_carrier_3_desc:1 "As the world is starting to burn around us the destructive power of air superiority is becoming undeniable. It is becoming imperative to stay ahead in being able to wield such a force on the seas if Sweden is ever going to succeed as a blue-water navy."

SWE_carrier_4:1 "Lindman Class"
SWE_carrier_4_desc:1 "Named after the recently deceased admiral and former prime-minister Arvid Lindman this ship would be the pride of Sweden and a force to be reckoned with on any sea."

USA_submarine_1:0 "S Class"
USA_submarine_1_desc:0 "The S boats, commonly known as Sugar Boats, were a series of 51 submarines design and built in the 1920s. Over the WW1 era O & R Boat series, the S Boats were larger allowing longer range and more torpedo reloads even though the class only had four forward-facing 21 inch tubes. Despite their age, with the last S Boat to be commissioned in 1924, the S Boats comprise a significant portion of the US Navy's standing Submarine force."
#USA_submarine_1b: "Barracuda Class"
USA_submarine_2:0 "Porpoise Class"
USA_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Porpoise Class submarine was the US Navy's first modern submarine designed and built following a series of experimental 'V Boats' built in the late 20s and early 30s. Despite initial issues with the all-electric propulsion, the class held promise and was being considered as future designs. The class was armed with 6 torpedo tubes and a 3-inch deck gun."
#USA_submarine_2b: "Salmon Class"
USA_submarine_3:0 "Tambor Class"
USA_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Tambor class was the culmination of years of US Naval experimentation of both Submarine design to fit the role of \"Fleet Boat\" and perform well in the waters of the Pacific Ocean. Armament was upgraded to 10 torpedo tubes with four firing aft, 3\" deck gun with two AA guns for additional protection."
#USA_submarine_3b: "Gato Class"
USA_submarine_4:0 "Balao Class"
USA_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Balao Class was a continuation of the design rooted in the Tambor class. Improvements came in the form of hull reinforcement and upgrading the deck gun to a 5-inch/24 calibre along with numerous subtle design improvements."
USA_destroyer_1:0 "Clemson Class"
USA_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Clemson Class destroyer continued with many design elements of its immediate predecessor, the Wickes Class. The Clemson had improved sea handling over the Wickes Class and was armed with 4"/50 calibre main guns, a 3"/23 calibre AA gun and 12 torpedo tubes. The class was ageing and was nearly obsolete, but still comprised the bulk of the US Navy's Destroyer force."
#USA_destroyer_1b: "Farragut Class"
USA_destroyer_2:0 "Sims Class"
USA_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Sims Class was the largest '1500 Tonner' design with a more streamlined torpedo arrangement and longer hull. Improvement in fire control granted better attack capabilities with its 5-inch/38 calibre guns and included 12 centerline torpedo tubes."
#USA_destroyer_2b: "Benson & Gleaves Class"
USA_destroyer_3:0 "Fletcher Class"
USA_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Fletcher Class represented a large step forward in terms of destroyer capability, thanks largely to its increase to 2500 tons. While keeping the 5-inch/38 dual purpose guns and centerline torpedo arrangement, the class added an additional single turret and received significant increases in AA weaponry as well as improved range and larger displacement."
USA_destroyer_4:0 "Allen M Sumner Class"
USA_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Sumner Class continued on the Fletcher Class with displacement only marginally increased. The ship was able to take on more armament gaining dual 5-inch/38 calibre guns and a much larger compliment of AA weaponry. The addition of a second rudder allowed for improve manoeuvring during ASW operations."
USA_light_cruiser_1:0 "Omaha Class"
USA_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Omaha Class was initially designed to fill a key scouting role in the US Navy's WW1 fleet. A fast and capable class, the Omaha Class was armed with a formidable load out of 6-inch/53 calibre guns in an 8x1 and 2x2 turret configuration and six torpedo launchers. The Omaha Class was ageing but comprised of the bulk of the US Navy's Light Cruiser force."
USA_light_cruiser_2:0 "Brooklyn Class"
USA_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Brooklyn Class was designed with the Washington Naval Treaty in mind and so was restricted to 6" guns. To maximise firepower, the Brooklyn's was armed with 15 of the new Mk16 6" guns in triple turrets. The overall design was very balanced and was considered as the basis of all future cruiser designs for the US Navy."
USA_light_cruiser_3:0 "Cleveland Class"
USA_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Cleveland Class was based on the Brooklyn Class, but without the Washington Naval Treaty restrictions. The Cleveland Class keeps the 15 6" main gun arrangement, but increased its secondary 5" armament greatly and added additional AA weaponry."
USA_light_cruiser_4:0 "Fargo Class"
USA_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Fargo Class improved on the successful Cleveland Class. It offered improved fields of AA fire thanks to a better designed pyramid-shaped superstructure."
USA_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Pensacola Class"
USA_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Pensacola Class were designed under the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty, and sought to maximise firepower under the 8" gun restriction. It was armed with a formidable armament of 10 x 8"/55 guns. The hull armour was thin and the design was top heavy but capable. It formed the bulk of the US Navy's Heavy Cruiser force."
#USA_heavy_cruiser_1b: "Portland Class"
USA_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Wichita Class"
USA_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Wichita Class ships improved armament over the Pensacola Class and its variants with a new turret design for its 8"55 calibre guns and improved the fields of fire for its secondary armament of 5"/38 guns. "
USA_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Baltimore Class"
USA_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Baltimore Class brought together the more successful elements of previous cruiser designs and was based largely off of the Brooklyn Class light cruiser married with configurations with armament and armour from the USS Wichita."
USA_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Oregon City Class"
USA_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Oregon City Class cruisers provided broad and marginal improvements over the Baltimore Class. Most notably was the change in the super structure which allowed better fields of AA fire. Similar improvements were also found from the Cleveland to the Oregon City class light cruisers."
USA_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Lexington Class"
USA_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Lexington Class was initially a reaction to Japan's Kongo class battlecruiser. Ordered by the Naval Act of 1916, the ships were intended to carry 16-inch guns in dual turrets and be capable of 33 knots. After construction began, the US entered into the Washington Naval Treaty and the USS Lexington and USS Saratoga was converted to Carriers."
USA_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Alaska Class"
USA_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Alaska Class was a response to the German pocket battleships now more so to Japan's "super cruisers." Designed to carry 12" guns and handle up to 10" shell fire, the class was capable of cruiser speeds but sacrificed under water protection."
USA_battleship_1:0 "New York Class"
USA_battleship_1_desc:0 "The New York Class battleships were the first US Battleships to be armed with the 14-inch/45 calibre main guns. Numerous 5-inch/51 guns provided secondary armament and over 10 inches of armour."
#USA_battleship_1b: "Pennsylvania Class"
#USA_battleship_1c: "New Mexico Class"
USA_battleship_2:0 "North Carolina Class"
USA_battleship_2_desc:0 "The North Carolina Class was a challenging design and was the first battleship class built by the US Navy in 20 years. The US Navy required this class to meet the standards of Washington Naval Treaty, limited to 36,000 tons yet be armed with the 160-inch/45 calibre guns and have improved armour while being capable of escorting the US Navy's fast aircraft carriers."

USA_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Iowa Class added all the innovations and capabilities of the earlier North Carolina, but substantially increases its displacement and tactical speed. The Iowa's was primarily responsible for escorting carriers groups and was designed with a second role of "cruiser killer" in mind."
USA_battleship_4:0 "Illinois Class"
USA_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Illinois Class continued with the design and role defined by the Iowa Class. It maintained speed and armament over armour. The Illinois Class increased the number of 16-inch/50 calibre guns from 9 to 12 while it also improved boilers and machinery in order to provide more efficient high cruise speeds. Like the Montana Class, initial designs included four 4 6-inch guns dual turrets, but this was reverted to the dual purpose 5-inch twin turret emplacements to maximise AA capabilities."
USA_carrier_1:0 "Lexington Class"
USA_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Lexington Class carrier was born from the converted hulls of two Lexington Class battlecruisers in order to conform to the limitations imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty. The class was the first operational carrier class in the US Navy and spent several years improving carrier operations."
USA_carrier_2:0 "Ranger Class"
USA_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ranger Class was the first US Navy class designed as a carrier from the keel up. As part of a US Navy smaller carrier concept the class was much smaller than the previous Lexington Class, yet still retained the same air group compliment thanks to improvements on interior designs."
#USA_carrier_2b: "Yorktown Class"
#USA_carrier_2c: "Wasp Class"
USA_carrier_3:0 "Essex Class"
USA_carrier_3_desc:0 "With the lessons learned from the preceding Lexington, Ranger and Yorktown variant classes, the result was the Essex Class, a fast ship able to carry a large compliment of planes into battle. Damage control designs would also be carried over from the Yorktown class and a deck edge elevator was included to improve plane handling."
USA_carrier_4:0 "Midway Class"
USA_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Midway Class was the ultimate in US Navy carrier capability. Implementing an armoured deck and able to carry far more aircraft than previous classes, the Midway Class was being given a unique sub-class designation, CVB (Carrier Vessel Battle)."
USA_SH_battleship_1:0 "Virginia Class"
USA_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "In 1920 the construction of the large South Dakota Class battleships fielding 12 x 16"/50 guns started. The class would have ushered in a new era in heavy battleship design but was cancelled in 1922 to conform to the Washington Naval Treaty. With the Treaty no longer in effect and the threat of a secret Japanese battleship project we can modernise the design, increase displacement to over 55,000 tons and up gun the design with 18"/50 calibre guns to create a new class of heavy battleship."
USA_SH_battleship_2:0 "Montana Class"
USA_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Montana Class was bigger and more armoured than the Illinois Class, sacrificing speed to accommodate the increase. Its main armament of 12 x 18-inch/50 calibre guns and with our latest fire control system the Montana's firepower will be unmatched. Initial designs included 6-inch guns, but this was changed to return to the dual purpose 5-inch twin turret emplacements."

YUN_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "Kunming Type 88"
YUN_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "Originally a product of late Guangxu era 'Self Strengthening' efforts, the Type 88 was designed as a close copy of the German Gewehr 88 with export modifications. While collectively inferior to newer rifles despite improvements, and often poorly maintained, the weapon is known to be rugged and reliable if unweildy.\n\nThis variety is mainly produced at the Kunming Arsenal in Yunnan, though equipment shortages and personal preference often see it used alongside non-standard weapons such as the Daodao."
YUN_infantry_equipment_1:0 "Kunming Type 27"
YUN_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "Kunming Type 27"
YUN_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "Originally called the 'Xuantong Type 27', this rifle was put into Qing service in 1935 through German assistance after the Restoration. The weapon is functionally a near copy of the German Mauser M1924, and a considerable improvement over the much older Type 88 in terms of weight and recoil.\n\nFirst produced at the Hanyang arsenal with German tools, manufacturing methods have already spread to Kunming, though it may not fully replace its predecessors for some time."

YUN_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "Thanks to the flood of Weltkrieg surplus into the world market in the early 1920s, the MP18 saw action in China some time before a modified version began production in Tsingtao.\n\nWith changes to the magazine and stock, this particular product of Sino-German cooperation has been copied and sold throughout Northern and Southern China, though primarily to the Qing Government."

YUN_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The General Liu Rifle, originally produced in small quantities in 1916, represented China's first independent foray into modern arms design, but unfortunately never made its way into full-scale production due to the death of its designer.\n\nThe weapon itself was by most accounts impressive for its time, and the superintendant at the Kunming Arsenal has proposed that its design might be updated and issued as the 'Liu Type 2'."
