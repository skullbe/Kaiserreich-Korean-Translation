It was intended as a counter to the Russian T-34, and as a replacement for the Panzer III and Panzer IV. While never replacing the latter, it served alongside it and the heavier Tiger tank until the end of the war. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tank of the Second Weltkrieg."

They were very successful tank destroyers but performed badly when used out of role as substitutes for tanks or assault guns, as most tank destroyers were.

It entered service late in the war (1944) and saw service on the Eastern and Western fronts. The Jagdpanther combined the very powerful 8.8 cm PaK 43 cannon of the Tiger II and the characteristically excellent armour and suspension of the Panther chassis, although it suffered from the general poor state of Germany in the later part of the war, which resulted in small production numbers, shortage in spare parts and poor crew training."

After the war we have made efforts to acquire tanks of our own. So far we only have access to imported, and outdated, tanks. This has to change if we ever wish to be a force to be reckoned with. The m/21 is a step in the right direction as we assembled it domestically even if the parts were imported. Dubbed "Strv m/21", short for Stridsvagn, which means "battle wagon", this is out first attempt at creating an armoured force."

With a new 37mm cannon mounted in a new turret design, we can fight toe-to-toe with the European powers, if not beat them outright. If we are ever to make Germany pay for letting our people be subjects of the Finns, having a 37mm cannon against the 20mm of theirs is definitely a good start."

SWE_light_tank_aa_equipment_3_short:0 "LVF L-74"
SWE_light_tank_aa_equipment_3_desc:0 "With a small frame that can easily be concealed in terrain, a strong engine with high-speed, and a deadly 40mm AA-cannon, this is the optimal weapon of war to use in the vast forests that the borders of our country houses."

SWE_medium_tank_equipment_1:0 "Stridsvagn m/38"
SWE_medium_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Strv m/38"
SWE_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "It has become clear that we need something more in order to stand a chance on the modern battlefield than just our light tanks. Sacrificing speed for power, the m/38 is more heavily armed and armoured than the L-60D which it is based on."
SWE_medium_tank_equipment_2:0 "Stridsvagn m/40"
SWE_medium_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Strv m/40"
SWE_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "By stretching our innovative design to the limit, we can once again make a significant upgrade to our mechanised flotilla. This tank provides everything we need to be a force to be reckoned with."

SWE_medium_tank_equipment_3_short:0 "Strv m/42"
SWE_medium_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "We can no longer rely on the hopelessly outdated L-60 chassis to provide for the defence of our homeland. With a powerful 75mm cannon well-suited for fighting in cities and forests alike, this tank can also attain a max speed of 42km/h."

SWE_medium_tank_artillery_equipment_1_short:0 "IKV 38"
SWE_medium_tank_artillery_equipment_1_desc:0 "We can easily swap out the all-purpose cannon in the m/38 for a howitzer in order to provide our country with a reliable assault-gun. This vehicle can keep pace with the rest of our armoured units and shell infantry in their entrenched positions to make way for a breakthrough."
SWE_medium_tank_artillery_equipment_2:0 "Infanterikanonvagn 40"
SWE_medium_tank_artillery_equipment_2_short:0 "IKV 40"

SWE_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_1_desc:0 "With a small casemate instead of a turret, we can safely house a proper anti-tank gun within the chassis of a Strv m/38. This vehicle has trouble firing on the move and is best used for supportive or defensive roles."

SWE_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_2_short:0 "PVF 40"
SWE_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_2_desc:0 "By adding skirt armour, a reinforced frontal glacis plate, and a new high-velocity 75mm Anti-Tank gun that fires APCR rounds we can push our anti-tank capabilities to the limit."

SWE_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_3_short:0 "PVF 42"
SWE_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_3_desc:0 "Using the Strv m/42 instead of the m/40 as a starting point allows us to mount an even larger and more powerful gun. By using what we learned from our other designs we can achieve a vehicle that is fast as a medium tank yet packs the same punch as a heavy tank."

SWE_heavy_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Lago"
SWE_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "While somewhat outdated, this design is a sturdy and reliable, enough so for us to be able to export it to other warring nations. A comparatively thick frontal plate protects this slow-moving hunk of metal from enemy AT guns of its time, although it's rapidly becoming obsolete in the face of new anti-tank technology."

SWE_heavy_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Strv 100"
SWE_heavy_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Strv 100 is a viscious beast of a tank that is as heavy as it is well-armoured. While being somewhat of an industrial nightmare to produce, this tank will ensure that our army has the tools it needs to defend our country."

SWE_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_2_short:0 "Sav 100"
SWE_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_2_desc:0 "The large chassis of the Strv 100 allows us to mount a much longer gun in comparison to everything else we've had up until now. Ths Sav 100 represents the next step in the development of self-propelled artillery."

SWE_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_3_short:0 "Sav 101"
SWE_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Strv 101 chassis can, with some tweaks, accustom a 15cm howitzer. The barrel of the gun is about as long as the vehicle itself, which would make a lighter tank incredibly unstable. Fortunately, the sheer weight and size of the Strv 101 makes such an accommodation possible."

SWE_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_3_short:0 "IKV 101"
SWE_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_3_desc:0 "Instead of adding a casemate, we can lower the gun into the body of the tank itself. This gives the vehicle a very low profile from which to unleash accurate long-ranged anti-tank fire."

SWE_heavy_tank_aa_equipment_1_short:0 "Lvkv 1"

SWE_heavy_tank_aa_equipment_2_short:0 "Lvkv 100"
SWE_heavy_tank_aa_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Strv 100 is significantly larger and heavier than the Lago, and provides for a much better platform from which to fire our famed 40mm gun."

SWE_heavy_tank_aa_equipment_3_short:0 "Lvkv 101"
SWE_heavy_tank_aa_equipment_3_desc:0 "While a platform for the 7.5cm gun is something we have long sought after, it has remained implausible to conceive of such a vehicle.

SWE_super_heavy_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Gustav Adolf"
SWE_super_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "A tribute to the Swedish king who ordered the Vasa ship, the largest at its time, to be built. This landship, which is exactly that, is meant to give our country a weapon like none other. This monstrous behemoth will bow down any opposition to our might with its twin 105mm guns."

SWE_super_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_1:0 "Supersvårt Stormartilleri"
SWE_super_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_1_short:0 "SSSA"
SWE_super_heavy_tank_artillery_equipment_1_desc:0 "Weighing 200 tons, this armored beast is a large platform for the 283mm naval gun that is usually only fitted on ships. This impressive arrangement can deliver fire with a accurate range of over 20km."

SWE_super_heavy_tank_aa_equipment_1_short:0 "SSLVKV"
SWE_super_heavy_tank_aa_equipment_1_desc:0 "Super-heavy anti-air is so far only a hypothetical concept, but with the advent of high flying quad-engined bombers and the invention of the jet engine this concept may just as well become a reality if we are to survive on the modern battlefield. An arrangement of a twin 128mm AA gun firing HEI (High-Explosive Incendiary) shells at enemy aircraft, the "Supersvår Luftvärnskanonvagn" (Super-Heavy Anti-Aircraft Gun Wagon) is the worst nightmare of any bomber pilot."

SWE_modern_tank_equipment_1:0 "Stridsvagn 103"
SWE_modern_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Strv 103"
SWE_modern_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The pinnacle of all of our previous developments, this tank has everything we could ever desire of an armored fighting vehicle. The only thing more modern than this would be a tank with optical camouflage and a railgun, but until that happens this tank will be enough for the next 50 years."

SWE_modern_tank_artillery_equipment_1:0 "Självgående Artillerivagn 103 Blixtnedslag"
SWE_modern_tank_artillery_equipment_1_short:0 "Blixtnedslag"
SWE_modern_tank_artillery_equipment_1_desc:0 "Blixtnedslag, meaning Lightning Strike, is exactly that. With a comparatively low profile, this self-propelled gun can set up and fire from forest glades and other concealed areas. Using computerised fire-control, this modern weapon of war gives us a foot into the next Weltkrieg, should such a horrific event ever occur."

SWE_modern_tank_destroyer_equipment_1_short:0 "Varulven"
SWE_modern_tank_destroyer_equipment_1_desc:0 "Varulven means "The Werewolf" and this name is not chosen by accident. This low-profile tank-destroyer stalks its prey while being well concealed in the Swedish forests, before unleashing destruction with its 122mm anti-tank gun."

SWE_modern_tank_aa_equipment_1:0 "Luftvärnskanonvagn 103 Hagelskur"
SWE_modern_tank_aa_equipment_1_short:0 "Hagelskur"
SWE_modern_tank_aa_equipment_1_desc:0 "Modern jet aircraft are simply too fast to be shot down with a single blow from a comparatively low-velocity cannon. Instead we can rely on sheer numbers. Hagelskur, meaning Hail Shower, is designed to output a volume of fire that is as high as possible. Octuple 20mm AA-cannons in a gatling-configuration, each packing AP-I shells, should be more than enough to light up the sky."

IRE_light_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Named after the revolutionary leader Patrick Pearse, who died in the Easter Rising of 1916. The Pearse I was the first real Irish attempt at producing their own line of armour, and owed much to the German WK1 tanks delivered to them during peace time."
IRE_light_tank_equipment_2:0 "Wolfe ILA-36"
IRE_light_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Wolfe L-36"
IRE_light_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Wolfe light tank was designed in 1936 as a considerable upgrade to the previous Pearse tank built in '34. Named after the father of Irish republicanism, Wolfe Tone, the Wolfe was a quick and nimble tank that packed a punch despite it's size."

IRE_light_tank_equipment_3_short:0 "Emmet L-41"
IRE_light_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Produced in 1941, the Emmet light tank was the final Irish effort to produce a modern light tank for use in WK2. Faster than the prior two iterations and better armoured, it lacked the punching power of the heavier Collins or Savage models, but made up for it by being cheaper to produce and more flexible."
IRE_medium_tank_equipment_1:0 "O'Connell IMA-39"
IRE_medium_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "O'Connell M-39"
IRE_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The O'Connell IMA-39 was the first in a new series of medium tank designs created by the Irish Republican Army. Much more heavily armoured than the lighter designs and with more firepower, the IMA-39 was still a highly mobile tank.

Only a few models ever saw production due to the massive cost it took to produce them, but it is unlikely that the Cormac would ever have seen widespread use in battle even if it had come earlier in the war. Like many super-heavy tanks, it was simply too unreliable."

It was nicknamed the Ruck-Zu(rü)ck (German slang for "back and forth") by Austrian troops and "Ta-Pum" by Italian troops who even wrote a song about it during The Great War."

The British prefer to call them "tanks", a name adopted during the early stages of their development as a security measure to conceal their purpose, while the German counterpart, "Panzer", stuck in many German-influenced nations. Early tanks were armed with machineguns and small cannons, moved slowly, and were armoured only enough to stop small arms fire."
