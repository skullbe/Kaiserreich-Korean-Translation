### Leader Descriptions ###
POLITICS_ADALBERT_I_DESC:0 "Adalbert von Hohenzollern's tenure as king of the Flems and Walloons has been quite peculiar. Inaugurated not by coronation, but by swearing an oath on the constitution, Adalbert, who also converted to Catholicism to align himself with his nation's populace, has long sought the respect, if not admiration, of his people. In defeat, however, the Belgian people have refused to relinquish their pride; Flems and Walloons alike despise Adalbert and his native Germany."
POLITICS_ALBERT_I_DESC:0 "Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the king who trounced the invading Germans at the Yzer, has returned to Belgium from exile in Canada. When his motorcade entered Brussels for the first time since the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, church bells across the nation rang, and many Belgians weeped with joy. German collaborators and syndicalists, however, lament the restored King, and plot to undermine the new Belgian government. Albert must now mend the deep wounds which have marred Belgium, and create a renewed sense of hope among the its people."
POLITICS_JORIS_SEVEREN_DESC:0 "Joris Van Severen, Flemish leader who begrudgingly cooperated with the occupying Germans, has assumed control of the country. His Verdinaso has a radical vision for the direction of Belgium, including territorial expansion and the promotion of Catholicism in all aspects of society. Under van Severen, a new Belgium will certainly arise; though that new nation may be incredibly different from the one that came before it."
POLITICS_PAUL_ZEELAND_DESC:0 "Paul van Zeeland and the Catholic Party led Flemish resistance to German control. With electoral victory in the now restored Belgium, van Zeeland endeavors to establish Chistian Democracy in Belgium, and reconcile that which divides Belgium's people, Flems and Walloons alike. Principle among his policy goals is the betterment of working conditions for both farmers and industrial labors."
POLITICS_BELGIAN_PARLIMENT_DESC:0 "The Belgian Parliament, successor to the Flemish Council which advised the German controlled government of Flanders-Wallonia, has assumed power in the recently restored Belgium. While the government is restructured and elections prepared, the parliament acts not just as a legislature, but collectively as interim head of state."
POLITICS_HENRIK_MAN_DESC:0 "Henrik de Man, a moderate social democrat, has consolidated his leadership of the Belgian Workers' Party, and now achieved victory in Belgium's latest national elections. De Man advocates limited economic nationalisation and the empowerment of union leaders to a governmental advisory role. Belgium, De Man believes, must actively serve its people and promote fair competition; his reforms, though controversial, may yet decrease economic hardship and political radicalisation in Belgium."
POLITICS_JOSEPH_JACQUEMOTTE_DESC:0 "Joseph Jacquemotte, creator and editor of the leftist pre-Weltkrieg newpaper 'L'Exploité', and his Syndicalist faction of the Belgian Workers' Party have achieved victory both within the party, and now, Belgium itself. Jacquemotte advocates rural industrialisation and the collectvisation of industry and agriculture alike. A Belgium led by Jacquemotte is certain to see drastic societal and economic upheaval."
POLITICS_PAUL_HENRI_SPAAK_DESC:0 "Paul Henri Spaak, once a prominent lawyer, believes that, above all else, to truely serve the people, government bureaucracy must be efficient. Spaak is now in contol of the Belgian Workers' Party, and the party's subsequent victory in the most recent Belgian national elections has elevated him to head of state. Spaak has already begun to greatly decrease the bloated Belgian civil service and introduced new incentives to prospective entrepreneurs; as a result, optimism seems to be steadily increasing in Belgium."
POLITICS_PAUL_EMILE_JANSON_DESC:0 "Paul-Émile Janson and his Liberal Party has achieved victory in Belgium's latest national elections. Janson is an advocate of laissez faire economics and free trade; all aspects of society, to Janson, have been far too regulated by past administrations. Belgium, under Janson, is quickly becoming one of the most economically free nations in Europe and the world."

### Events ###
bel.1.t:0 "Disaster of the 17th of February '36"
bel.1.d:0 "The 17th February, which marks the day that Adalbert I was crowned and took control of Belgium has yearly been marked with celebrations in the capital. Military parades and fanfares announced the start of the celebrations and at 12 'o clock Adalbert mounted the balcony of the palace watching over the Warande. As he addresses the population and celebrates another peaceful year, a loud bang resounded against the stone walls of the palace. In the midst of the crowd a group of revolter has fired a gun in the direction of the King. They shout "Vive la Révolution" and "Weg met de mof!". Dozens of men and women placed at tactical locations in the crowd by the combined resistance start rallying the people and prepare to storm the palace. Police quickly mobilises and forms a protective circle around the palace gates. The crowd starts dispersing into the surrounding streets and quickly the revolt becomes too large for the local police force."
bel.1.a:0 "Try to calm the protesters with small concessions"
bel.1.b:0 "Send in the army!"
bel.1.c:0 "We should wait for them to calm down"
bel.2.t:0 "Black Monday hits Flanders-Wallonia!"
bel.2.d:0 "On the 2nd of February the German Stock Market crashed resulting in an economic crisis like never before. Flanders-Wallonia, already weakened by the reparations and reconstruction of its country has been hit very hard. Hundreds left the Brussels stock exchange crying and screaming. A Drastic action will be required to save the struggling people of Flanders-Wallonia."
bel.2.a:0 "What will we do?" 
bel.3.t:0 "Send in the Troops"
bel.3.d:0 "The closest division was quickly mobilised and used to suppress the rioters. The rioters however, enraged by the heavy weaponry, became even more violent and attacked the palace defences. The army was finally able to suppress the rioters by opening fire. 106 rioters would find their death the same day and hundreds more were arrested in the following days. We seem to have temporarily regained control but strong measures will have to be implemented to prevent another disaster. "
bel.3.a:0 "Prepare for further violence"
bel.4.t:0 "Make small concessions"
bel.4.d:0 "After summoning Parliament the King decided it was time for change."
bel.4.a:0 "You can now reform the Government"
bel.5.t:0 "Wait for them to calm down"
bel.5.d:0 "Trapped in the palace but safe from the rioters outside, the king decided not to result to heavy weaponry and try to calm the protesters by using local police force. The riot however would not be easily suppressed and started to spread throughout the entire city. Student organisations in the cities of Brussels itself, Leuven and Ghent had been preparing their own protest march and quickly organised themselves. Chanting the Brabançonne and the Vlaamse Leeuw, waving banners and protesting through the streets quickly became nearly too much for the police."
bel.5.a:0 "Its only becoming worse!"
bel.6.t:0 "Walloons in Charleroi and Mons rise up"
bel.6.d:0 "Massive strikes and protest are also plaguing Wallonia, where the large industrial cities of Charleroi and Mons have started organising themselves into a full scale rebellion. Supported by the syndicalist resistance and raids of the Police headquarters in Mons, the revolvers have reorganised themselves outside of the city biding their time."
bel.6.a:0 "Will this never end?"
bel.7.t:0 "Mass Desertion"
bel.7.d:0 "As the rebellion grows by the day, many soldiers of the former Belgian army have deserted and joined forces with the rebellion. Well armed they may pose a significant threat to our ability to suppress the revolt." 
bel.7.a:0 "Ask German reinforcements"
bel.7.b:0 "We can handle this on our own!"
bel.8.t:0 "Support for Independence grows"
bel.8.d:0 "As the different factions keep growing there will soon be a choice that might decide the future of our country. For the moment there is little contact between the Walloon rebels and the Flemish. It might be in our best interest to keep the situation separated until we can crack the rebellion down."
bel.8.a:0 "Keep them separated and we will prevail!"
bel.8.b:0 "We can't spare the resources at the moment."
bel.9.t:0 "Mayday"
bel.9.d:0 "On the first of May the syndicalists celebrate the fight for the 8-hour workday as described by the second Internationale in 1889. Despite the rebellion raging on throughout Belgium many syndicalists see this day as sacred and guerrilla strikes will be less fierce today. This could be our opportunity to organise a counter attack!"
bel.9.a:0 "Perform coordinated strikes against key figures."
bel.9.b:0 "Install a curfew in Liege, Namur and Charleroi."
bel.9.c:0 "It may be too dangerous to provoke them any further."
bel.10.t:0 "Assassination attempts have Failed!"
bel.10.d:0 "During the assault by our troops on the Charleroi Headquarters one of the soldiers who sympathised with the syndicalist cause turned his back on his fellow soldiers and lured them into a trap. Syndicalist forces could quickly capture the rest of his unit and are holding them hostage."
bel.10.a:0 "Is there nothing we can do right?"
bel.11.t:0 "Syndicalists and Royalists unite!"
bel.11.d:0 "After the catastrophic attack on the Charleroi headquarters the Royalists and Syndicalists have reinforced their pact and set aside their differences until German occupation has come to an end."
bel.11.a:0 "They have only made themselves a bigger target!"
bel.12.t:0 "Syndicalists stand alone"
bel.12.d:0 "After we successfully cut the communications between Flemish and Walloon resistance, the syndicalists of Wallonia stand alone. With no real way to get support for their own free syndicalist state, they will have to seek aid from the Commune of France."
bel.12.a:0 "Finally a victory!"
bel.13.t:0 "Syndicalists strike back!"
bel.13.d:0 "After the catastrophic attack on the Charleroi headquarters the syndicalists are planning a massive terrorist attack on our infrastructure. We are however unable to reinforce both the army bases and our industrial complexes so we need to make a choice."
bel.13.a:0 "Protect the Army!"
bel.13.b:0 "Protect our Industry!"
bel.140.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Geuzengroep'"
bel.140.d:0 "Due to rising tensions in the Industrial city of Antwerp, a new resistance movement has been detected by our intelligence services. They are called the 'Geuzengroep' and seem to have gathered a lot of support around the harbour area, rallying the populace behind their cause. They seem to work mostly underground though and as such there seems to be no more intel about either their members or their leader."
bel.140.a:0 "Keep a close eye on them"
bel.141.t:0 "Attack on the Headquarters of the 'Vlaamse Wacht'"
bel.141.d:0 "During the night a dozen members of the Witte Brigade stormed the Headquarters of the 'Vlaamse Wacht' located in Antwerp. The 'Vlaamse Wacht' or Flemish watch, was used as a reserve for the Feldgendarmerie and held a large arsenal in reserve. It seems that they may have had assistance from the inside as they were able to quickly get in and leave before reinforcements could arrive. Voices in the Kings circles call for the abolishment of the 'Vlaamse Wacht' as they may betray us and side with Flemish Liberation movements."
bel.141.a:0 "Increase supervision of the 'Vlaamse Wacht'"
bel.141.b:0 "Abolish the 'Vlaamse Wacht'"
bel.142.t:0 "Loss of the 20th Train Convoy"
bel.142.d:0 "After the capture of a large terrorist cell trying to breach the Von Bissingkazerne in Mechelen, the commander has decided to transport the prisoners to a safer location closer to the main bulk of the army. 276 prisoners were put on the train convoy, called the 20th Train Convoy. Accompanied by a convoy of 15 soldiers and their officer, they left for Leuven. However between Boortmeerbeek and Haacht the train was stopped by three young men who under fire by the German forces opened the prison train and allowed 168 of the prisoners to escape before the Germans regained control of the train."
bel.142.a:0 "Strengthen the protection of our convoys!" 
bel.143.t:0 "Groupe G"
bel.143.d:0 "While our forces were engaged in Wallonia, a devastating terrorist attack was launched on the Electrical Train Network by the infamous Groupe G. They are a resistance movement composed almost entirely of students from the ULB, free university of Brussels. Encouraged by the protest at the universities of Gent and Leuven, a group of engineering students from the ULB prepared a nationwide attack on the railroad system. This was the first time an attack occured in both Flanders and Wallonia by the same group. We will have to stay wary of further cooperation between the two regions."
bel.143.a:0 "Track down these Students!"
bel.144.t:0 "Armée secrète/Geheim Leger"
bel.144.d:0 "Reports have reached us that the deserting forces are gathering in the villages around Poperinge. They seem to rally as close as possible to the French border, making large scale troop movements by us difficult. Charly Claser, leader of this movement has started to expand the group very fast, exceeding our expectations. They are however in contrast to the other groups an (secret) army with a chain of command and armed to the teeth. It will not be easy to crack them down and we will have to keep a close eye on them."
bel.144.a:0 "Station a small brigade in the city of Ieper to keep them in check"
bel.14.t:0 "Status Flemish Resistance"
bel.14.d:0 "While we were trying to counter the Walloon syndicalists and had to withdraw some of our forces out of Flanders, the Flemish decided to work more underground and have been recruiting members into their movement. Priests have tried to convince their parochians to take up arms and liberate the nation while s in the cities have diffused illegal newspapers and propaganda to enlist as many as possible. The recruited rebels, guided by experienced veterans from both the army and veterans from the Weltkrieg, also performed small, coordinated raids against German transports and have been able to acquire quite the armory. It's not yet clear what they are up to but it would be wise to reinforce our control over Flandres, risking loss of control elsewhere."
bel.14.a:0 "Fall back into Antwerp, Limburg and Flemish-Brabant!"
bel.14.b:0 "Fall back into Flemish-Brabant!"
bel.14.c:0 "Reinforce all provinces!"
bel.15.t:0 "11th of July"
bel.15.d:0 "The 11th of July 1302 will always be remembered as the great victory over the French army at the Guldensporenslag. On this day an inferior Flemish army defeated the French knights. This victory marked an important point in the creation of the Independent Flemish movement and has been immortalised in the roman by "De leeuw van Vlaanderen" by Hendrik Conscience. With the temporary retreat of the German forces the Flemish Resistance memorises this day and has proclaimed the 11th of July a national holiday."
bel.15.a:0 "Vlaanderen de Leeuw!"
bel.16.t:0 "11th of July"
bel.16.d:0 "The 11th of July 1302 will always be remembered as the great victory over the French army at the Guldensporenslag. On this day an inferior Flemish army defeated the French knights. This victory marked an important point in the creation of the Independent Flemish movement and has been immortalised in the roman by "De leeuw van Vlaanderen" by Hendrik Conscience. With German forces spread thin to suppress the resistance the Flemish Resistance has prepared a massive attack to liberate the cities of Bruges, Gent, Kortrijk and Oostende. Due to our small forces we were quickly overrun and after 5 hours of heavy fighting our last stronghold at the Gravensteen in Ghent fell and the Flemish Lion proudly waves atop its battlements."
bel.16.a:0 "We have lost control over West and East Flanders!"
bel.17.t:0 "Flemish offer a deal"
bel.17.d:0 "After the loss of great parts of Flanders, the Flemish Resistance has proposed a deal. They demand independence from Flanders-Wallonia and immediate retreat off all German forces out of Flandres. In exchange they are willing to remain part of Mittel-Europa and fulfil their role as buffer state and will not aid the Syndicalists in Wallonia in their struggle."
bel.17.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept these demands."
bel.17.b:0 "Never! How dare they assume we would accept their proposal!"
bel.18.t:0 "Walloons hear of Flemish Victories"
bel.18.d:0 "After the victories of the Flemish Resistance over the German forces the Walloons will have to decide whether or not to work together with the Flemish for an unified Belgium or to seek affiliation with the Commune of France. The syndicalists are neighed to join the commune and spread the socialist revolution. The royalists would prefer to work together with the Flemish to unify the country and reinstate the king. After days of discussion the doors of the headquarters finally open and the decision is announced."
bel.18.a:0 "We shall seek Unification with the French Commune"
bel.18.b:0 "We shall approach our Flemish brethren and try to reinstate Belgium."
bel.19.t:0 "Flandres receives Walloon Deal"
bel.19.d:0 "After the proposal to the German government has failed, the Flemish receive a deal from the Walloon movement. They ask the Flemish to work together with them to ensure Independence for all of Belgium and to reinstate the King."
bel.19.a:0 "Flanders shall be Independent!"
bel.19.b:0 ""Eendracht maakt Macht!""L'union fait la force!""Unity is Strength!""
bel.20.t:0 "Hainaut Attacks"
bel.20.d:0 "After the Flemish and Walloons made their pact to unify Belgium, they launched an assault on the German Administration Offices in Mons and secured the governor and his family. They are now held hostage and are demanding retreat of German Forces out of Hainaut. We have surrounded the building and are ready to move in if necessary. The chances of extracting the governor succesfully are slim but we could resecure the building to reinforce it against further attacks and to tighten our grip on the province."
bel.20.a:0 "Launch an Assault on the building!"
bel.20.b:0 "We will have to give in."
bel.21.t:0 "Hainaut secured."
bel.21.d:0 "After we stormed the building the rebels immediately executed the hostages and kept fighting to the last man. We were however able to retake the building with minimal losses and have established a perimeter. Barbed wire and machine gun posts were quickly installed to deter any further attack and part of the city has been evacuated to make place for the 2nd Walloon Division to set up camp."
bel.21.a:0 "Very well."
bel.22.t:0 "Rebels push into Antwerp"
bel.22.d:0 "With renewed forces and help from Wallonia the Flemish Resistance pushes into Antwerp. Fighting in the streets ensues immediately and for 3 days there seems to be no clear winner until a tank depot falls to the Flemish forces and the Germans retreat to the east side of the city. At the same time a push was orchestrated towards Boom and Dendermonde ensuring liberation of most of the province Antwerp."
bel.22.a:0 "Fall back to Brussels"
bel.23.t:0 "Flemish forces approach the capital"
bel.23.d:0 "With their victories in Antwerp and the retreat of German forces out of Limburg we are left with only Brussels and Wallonia. As the movement keeps winning they gather more support and by now they heavily outnumber us. The only forces we have left are the division located in Brussels and two in Wallonia. We will have to make an important decision which will decide the fate of the country. Will we retreat into Germany, thus liberating Belgium or will we dig in and try to hold out as long as we can, hoping that Germany may recover quickly enough to support us?"
bel.23.a:0 "We will not risk any more German blood."
bel.23.b:0 "Dig in boys, its gonna be a though fight!"
bel.24.t:0 "German forces return to Germany"
bel.24.d:0 "On September 13th 1936 at 2:37 PM in the Royal Palace signs the former King Adalbert the Ceasefire resulting in his immediate abdication, the return of all German forces to Germany and a truce between the reborn nation of Belgium and the German Empire. Hundreds of thousands of men, women and children run into the streets waving the Belgian flag, chanting the Brabançonne and celebrating the regained independence. It truly is a great day for Belgium!"
bel.24.a:0 ""Lang leve België!""Vive la Belgique!""Long live Belgium!""
bel.241.t:0 "German forces return to Germany"
bel.241.d:0 "On September 20th 1936 at 2:37 PM in the Royal Palace signs the former King Adalbert the Ceasefire resulting in his immediate abdication, the return of all German forces to Germany and a truce between the reborn nation of Belgium and the German Empire.

bel.25.t:0 "Germans pushed back into Namur"
bel.25.d:0 "After our defeat at Mons and in return for the governor we have fallen back into Namur where we dug ourselves in. Any Walloon resistance will have to deal with our position and prepared troops!"
bel.25.a:0 "Watch out, those Walloons are everywhere!"
bel.26.t:0 "No further attack"
bel.26.d:0 "The Walloons have set up a perimeter around the city but aren't planning to immediately attack the city. They may be trying to secure Flanders first before moving any further."

The Rebels however have intercepted this message and have decided to attack as soon as they can. The troops surrounding Brussels move in under artillery support and the tanks captured in Antwerp swiftly breach our first line of defence. This is followed up by intense fighting in the metropolitan area of Brussels and is especially fierce in Schaarbeek en Dilbeek.

The 2 trains filled because of the morning commune collided at full speed immediately killing both drivers. 34 more casualties are counted and dozens of citizens are still trapped in the crash. Parliament has already expressed their condolences with the families of the victims and the King is planning to give a speech on the radio later this afternoon. An investigation commission will be founded to identify the reason for this catastrophe and to prevent this from happening again."

bel.800.t:0 "Terrorist plot discovered?"
bel.800.d:0 "The investigation behind the Train Crash from last week has taken an interesting turn. During the interrogation of the operative of the Signpost, he has confessed to have been warned an hour before the crash by a relative closely associated with the resistance and to help create an 'accident'. Both men were immediately arrested and Gendarmerie is investigating any leads between the men and known resistance members."

It appears that Hendrik Elias, head of the 'Vlaamse Wacht', was supposed to take this train for a routine inspection in Bruges. He was however unable to come and never boarded the train. Many feel like this attack was carried out against the 'Vlaamse Wacht' for siding with the German Regime. It might be wise to integrate them with our main police force to avoid further catastrophes."

bel.802.d:0 "The 'Vlaamse Wacht' has ever since the occupation of Belgium in the Weltkrieg received a special status seperating them from the main police force. They helped pacify the country during the war by promising the Flemish population independence and more rights for the Dutch language. When it however became clear after the war was over that Belgium would be turned into a puppet state of Germany, public opinion quickly turned against them. With many of the original force feeling abandonned by their leaders, large groups of men left the corps. The remaining parts of the Corps have however embraced their higher status and have established themselves as a form of secret police. So when the King decided to strip them of their power, many rose up and marched on Brussels to demand their rights back. Many fear retaliation by the resistance movement and are afraid that without the King's protection they will be severely punished."

bel.803.d:0 "The fear of the 'Vlaamse Wacht' was justified as in under 10 days more than a dozen former members were found dead, probably assassinated in revenge for their actions against the resistance.

With all weapons and equipment stripped of any markings, it's difficult to identify their origin but many inside the corps suspect they may originate from the French Commune. Other suspects are the Netherlands whom may be trying to reinstate their kingdom by liberating Flanders.

With members spread over the continent and assistance from both Paris and London, this inteligence group is huge threat to our national security. Due to their non-violent nature, they are difficult to track down and until now all attempts have yielded no results. Now however Efremov, leader of the Flanders-Wallonian branch has been captured in Oostende while trying to move to another safehouse. He was immediately interrogated and at last he gave up important members of the movement. After a wave of arrests in the following hours, 30 members were caught and executed.

bel.83.d:0 "Due to the large scale preparations of the German Empire, caused by new border conflicts with the French Commune the German Army has started a process of quickly rebuilding and expanding. For this expansion they require specialised equipment. Flanders-Wallonian expertise concerning small Fire-arms and anti-tank canons is widely appreciated and praised along German High Command. Therefore the Empire has offered us a deal where we supply them with weapons in exchange for monetary compensation. Due to the high demand by their army the supply for our own army may suffer shortages."

This has since the start of the occupation been the the task of members of the Flemish Council though due to recent events the King is inclined to let an outside German commission investigate to make sure that any corruption or covert operations are discovered. This would cause extreme turmoil though in Parliament as members would see this as yet another power grab from the King while neglecting the wishes of the people."

Recent renovations to the Palace and the German Embassy have cost the taxpayer for millions of Reichsmark. In these troubling times such expenses should not be allowed and will only further increase the burden of the common man. Therefore the Council has proposed to the King to delay the Works until after the Crisis situation is handled."

The puchase of a shipment of weapons from the German Empire, support equipment from Swiss and even an armoured convoy from the Netherlands. When verifying the destination of this equipment all signs point to the Leopoldskazerne in Ghent. This barracks has however not been used since 1933 when it was transformed into a hospital. It's as of yet unclear who authorised the purchases but main suspects are low ranking members of the Flemish Council whom may be aiding the rebels."

Slowdowns, high costs and annoying bureaucratic struggles keep delaying the reforms. It's clear that at this pace it will take until 1940 before the first reforms are implemented.

It seems that the shipments directed to the Leopoldskazerne originate from a high level circle of the Flemish Council. Frans van Cauwelaert has been placed at the head of this organisation and has been responsible for unrest and dissent since the Weltkrieg. It seems that they tried to shuffle funds into Resistance hands by infiltrants in the Post Service. They were also able to spread their propaganda by the same channel and have been secretly organising rally's and meetings discussing the liberation of both Belgium and Flanders."

bel.840.d:0 "With a warrant for his arrest signed by the King himself, police forces surrounded his house in Brussels and tried to capture him.

bel.842.t:0 "German Favouritism"
bel.842.d:0 "Citizens in Flanders-Wallonia, though equal for the law, stand along a social hierarchy created by origin. German immigrants or citizens from the Empire are more likely to reach high ranking positions and seem to be able to exert more influence over the country than Flemish-Wallonian citizens. While this way of handling things is appreciated by the German population, it makes our other citizens very discontent. Joris Van Severen, member of the Flemish Council has proposed a solution to this problem by combating this favouritism. It would be greatly beneficial for the order and peace in the country but would receive fierce opposition in the German Empire."

bel.842.b:0 "Allow Van Severen to go ahead"
bel.843.t:0 "German citizens protest"
bel.843.d:0 "Due to recent reforms introduced by Joris Van Severen, concerning the status of German citizens, many have come down to the capital today to protest against this sudden turn by the government. Even though their numbers are small, a large outflux of money caused by their distrust in the government could be painful. Therefore Van Severen has proposed a very drastic plan which would allow us to seize their Flandern-Wallonian holdings if they decide to revolt. It's clear that such an action would provoke hostility with the Fatherland and especially with our German population."

Flemish nationalists sick of German tyranny had slowly been expanding their influence and after recent reforms by the King were finally able to excecute their coup. Around 12:47 PM, members of the Vlaamse Wacht with orders from Van Severen and other members of the Council departed in trucks from their barracks in Brussels. A first detachement rushed towards the federal parliament which was in session. By quickly overwhelming the security guards they were able to establish a fortified position and kept parliament hostage. Another detachement headed straight for the royal palace.  By using a special truck they rammed in the front gate and stormed straight to the palace. Overwhelming the royal guard, they were able to secure the palace. With a swift and powerful strike, the government was disabled."

In the city however, they were met with fierce resistance from the Underground movement which saw an opportunity and helped excecute the Coup. Unable to reach the Palace in time, Vlaamse Wacht quickly breached the last line of defence and poured into the royal dining room. There they met Adalbert, enjoying his soup and completely unaware of the situation. Hendrik Elias, head of the Vlaamse Wacht proposes him an ultimatum: He either abdicates voluntarily as King of Flanders-Wallonia and stays as a hostage until arrangements with the German Epire have been made or he is shot there and then."

The military as well suffered heavily during the first Weltkrieg from this divide with French officers not being able to communicate with their Flemish foot soldiers. The Flemish people have always found themselves to be misrepresented by these French aristocrats and have led to a certain hostility between the two groups. With the arrival of the German occupation there have been some improvements made towards the Dutch speaking communities but they have primarly just taken over from the French Elite and have created a similar situation wherein both French speaking as well as Dutch speaking population have less rights than the German invaders. Because of the large scale reforms of the military the time has however come to improve national unity by allowing soldiers and politicians from all 3 languages to climb up the ranks."

As the vanguard of the West against the Syndicalist menace we are supposed to stop their advance on the bunkers of the Ludendorfflinie and push together with our German allies into the French hearthland. To the East the German behemoth watches us closely and will prove to be a difficult enemy should the need arise. North of us lie the Netherlands: neutral in the Weltkrieg, our former masters don't seem much of a threat with their ill-equipped army and friendly relations."

bel.95.t:0 "Status Report 2 : Economy of Flanders-Wallonia"
bel.95.d:0 "Occupation and major battles during the first Weltkrieg have clearly marked our country and hefty reparations and general dismantlement of our Industrial base have left us weak. What was once the 8th greatest industrial powerhouse in the world has been greatly harmed. Our people however are sturdy and were capable of rebuilding the industrial power back to somewhat of it's older glory. Much work however has to be done as much of the industry is reliant on German investements. To reinvigorate the economy the Adalbert Canal has been dug connecting the important harbour of Antwerp with the Steel industries of Liège. Coal mining has been expanded into the province of Limburg further stimulating the steel industry while the Flemish provinces have steadily developped their industrial power to partially replace the old Agricultural countryside."

bel.96.d:0 "Even though our country is a constitutional monarchy on paper, parliamentary control over the government is severely hampered. Moreover, political parties can only have a legal status and participate in elections if they accept the post-Weltkrieg stautus quo such as the Hohenzollern Monarchy, membership in Mitteleuropa etc. This limitation makes legal opposition parties stunted and ineffective. The government is advised by the Flemish Council which consists mainly of members of the higher class. They support the king and execute his decisions but have limited power. Two major opposition groups however contest this and are forced underground. First we have the royalist catholic party who seeks to restore Belgium and it's rightfull king Albert I, in exile in Canada. The other large group is the syndicalist party trying to improve working conditions and create a socialist regime like the Commune of France. Both of these groups have stronger ties in Wallonia with occasional frictions. The catholic party is however also widely accepted in the agrarian region of Flanders which still holds on the Catholic faith."

On this day an inferior Flemish army, supported by troops from Namur defeated the far superior French knights. This victory marked an important point in the creation of the Independent Flemish movement and has been immortalised in the roman by "De leeuw van Vlaanderen" by Hendrik Conscience. As many see the situation at the moment as dire as back then, support for the movement is at an all time high."

The 21st then marks the day that on the Koningsplein in Brussel he was sworn in as the first Belgian king.

After coordinated strikes by The Independence Army on the cities of Mons and Antwerp, they were finally able to push the Flandern-Wallonian army back to Brussels where after fierce fighting the German king surrendered. With no clear answer yet from the German Empire, many fear that an independent Belgium might be shortlived especially with tensions between the Empire and the Commune of France rising and the strategic location of the country."
