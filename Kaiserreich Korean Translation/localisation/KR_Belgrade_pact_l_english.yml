### Events ###
pact.1.t:0 "베오그라드 회의"
pact.1.d:0 "For years the Serbian government has been preparing for the Congress of Belgrade, a series of meetings to take place in our capital with representatives from our fellow Balkan nations of Romania and Greece, as well as diplomats from Germany and the Ottoman Empire. We will promote a series of geopolitical discussions in order to, among other goals, attract foreign support to our aspirations of expanding our frontiers and building a new state of Greater Serbia, encompassing all the lands historically ruled or populated by our folk. This could potentially drive us into conflict with Bulgaria, Albania, or even with the Habsburg Empire, however. Shall we send out the invitations?"
pact.1.a:0 "회의를 개회한다."
pact.1.b:0 "회의를 폐회한다."

pact.2.t:0 "베오그라드 회의"
pact.2.d:0 "Serbia has invited us to send a diplomat to Belgrade to take part in the Belgrade Congress to discuss the political and military situation in the Balkans. Since the victory of Bulgaria in the Weltkrieg we have our eyes on land that is rightfully ours, and so does Serbia. They suggest we form a new, formal alliance called the Belgrade Pact, to protect our mutual interests and contain the Bulgarian menace. This could, however, anger Bulgaria's former allies Germany, Austria and the Ottoman Empire."
pact.2.a:0 "Announce our support for the Belgrade Pact."
pact.2.b:0 "We have no interest in expanding in this direction."

pact.3.t:0 "[From.GetName]가 베오그라드 조약기구에 가입하다"
pact.3.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has announced they will attend the congress in Belgrade and formally join the Belgrade Pact."

pact.4.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has announced they will, for the time being, not be part of any formal alliance aimed at Bulgaria."
pact.4.a:0 "저들이 필요하지 않다."

pact.5.t:0 "두번째 전선"
pact.5.d:0 "Without the Greeks creating another front, we may not be able to win against the Bulgarians. Because of this, it has been suggested that we ask the Ottomans to join the Pact. However, this move could also result in the Ottomans supporting Bulgaria to prevent a weak northern neighbour."
pact.5.a:0 "오스만 제국을 초청하자."
pact.5.b:0 "우리는 그들 없이도 괜찮을 것이다."

pact.6.t:0 "세르비아가 베오그라드 조약기구에 초청하다"
pact.6.d:0 "In a surprising turn of events, the Serbian government has invited us to join the Belgrade Pact, an alliance clearly aimed at Bulgaria. Joining this Pact against our former ally would result in deteriorated relations with Germany and Austria. However, we may have a chance of claiming some land from Bulgaria or even expand in the direction of the Greeks, who decided not to join."
pact.6.a:0 "베오그라드 조약기구에 대해 지지를 표명한다."
pact.6.b:0 "그대신 불가리아를 지원한다!"

pact.7.t:0 "오스만 제국이 불가리아를 지원하다!"
pact.7.d:0 "As some people predicted, the Ottoman government has decided to support the Bulgarians! Their foreign minister stated they will not cooperate with enemies of it's former Central Power ally. Though the agreement hasn't yet been formalised in a real alliance, the Ottomans might come to the aid of the Bulgarians if we decide to attack them."
pact.7.a:0 "끔찍하군."

pact.8.t:0 "베오그라드 회의가 발칸반도에 대한 새로운 질서를 주장하다"
pact.8.d:0 "On the initiative of Serbia, several countries have convened in Belgrade to discuss the political and military situation on the Balkans. During this congress a new military alliance was founded, the so-called Belgrade Pact. This is clearly aimed against us, out of revenge of their loss in the Weltkrieg. We can only hope our former Central Power allies will support us in this crisis."
pact.8.a:0 "이거 좋지않군."

pact.9.t:0 "베오그라드 회의가 발칸반도에 대한 새로운 질서를 주장하다"
pact.9.d:0 "On the initiative of Serbia, several countries have convened in Belgrade to discuss the political and military situation on the Balkans. During this congress a new military alliance was founded, the so-called Belgrade Pact. This is clearly aimed against our former ally Bulgaria, of whom the countries have lost territory in the Weltkrieg. If we openly announce our support for Bulgaria, it may keep the Belgrade Pact from declaring war on them."
pact.9.a:0 "불가리아에 대한 지지를 선언한다!"
pact.9.b:0 "발칸국가들 사이에 엮이지말자"

pact.10.t:0 "[From.GetName](이)가 불가리아에 대한 지지를 선언했습니다"
pact.10.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has announced today that they will support Bulgaria in the case of a war between them and the Belgrade Pact. Whether this will be limited to arms deliveries or that [From.GetNameDef] will intervene with their army, remains unclear."
pact.10.a:0 "이거 좋지않군."

pact.11.t:0 "[From.GetName](이)가 우리에 대한 지지를 선언했습니다"
pact.11.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has announced today that they will support Bulgaria in the case of a war between us and the Belgrade Pact. Whether this will be limited to arms deliveries or that [From.GetNameDef] will intervene with their army, remains unclear, but hopefully this will keep them from declaring war."
pact.11.a:0 "[From.GetName], 고마워"

pact.12.t:0 "신 루마니아 외교 정책"
pact.12.d:0 "Our recent victory over the Iron Guard has put us in precarious position. Despite outwards sympathies displayed towards our new regime, we are without international protection. We have always been on friendly terms with Serbia. We can ask them to allow us to join their alliance, the Belgrade Pact."
pact.12.a:0 "우린 세르비아와 동맹을 맺어야한다!"
pact.12.b:0 "고립주의는 루마니아를 보호할 것이다"

pact.13.t:0 "루마니아가 베오그라드 조약기구 가입을 원합니다"
pact.13.d:0 "After their recent victory over the Iron Guard, the new Romanian government looks over the border. Since we share a long-time friendship and share common goals, they have asked to allow them to join the Belgrade Pact. This will be of great help in the case of the inevitable war."
pact.13.a:0 "당연히 가입할 수 있다."
pact.13.b:0 "우린 루마니아가 필요없다."

pact.14.t:0 "루마니아가 베오그라드 조약기구에 가입하다"
pact.14.d:0 "Serbia expressed their gratitude that we did not forget old alliances and want to join a common cause. Now we are part of the Belgrade pact."
pact.14.a:0 "우리의 독립이 보장되었군!"

pact.15.t:0 "세르비아가 우리의 제안을 거부하다"
pact.15.d:0 "In a surprising move, the Serbian government has refused our offer and will not allow us to join the Belgrade Pact."
pact.15.a:0 "그럼 우리끼리 해야겠군."

pact.16.t:0 "불가리아에 최후통첩"
pact.16.d:0 "With our armed forces and allies in the Belgrade Pact prepared, we are ready to repair injustices caused by the Weltkrieg and restore borders of Balkan to its pre-1914 state. We can send Bulgaria an ultimatum to hand over the territories, or face war."
pact.16.a:0 "최후통첩을 보내라!"
pact.16.b:0 "평화를 유지할 것이다."

pact.17.t:0 "세르비아에 최후통첩"
pact.17.d:0 "An ultimatum from the Belgrade Pact has arrived in Sofia. They are demanding that we hand over all territories we have seized during the Weltkrieg. The members of the Belgrade Pact are threatening us with war if we refuse."
pact.17.a:0 "그럼 전쟁이다."
pact.17.b:0 "선택지가 없군. 그들의 요구를 수용한다"

pact.18.t:0 "불가리아가 최후통첩을 무시하였습니다"
pact.18.d:0 "The Bulgarian government has declared they refuse to give in to our demands and will ignore the ultimatum we send them. The only solution to this will be war, to regain the lands that were occupied during the Weltkrieg!"
pact.18.a:0 "불가리아는 기회가 있었다!"

pact.19.t:0 "불가리아 포위"
pact.19.d:0 "The Bulgarian government, seeing the gathered forces of the Belgrade Pact on their borders, has agreed to the ultimatum to hand over all disputed territories, effective immediately. While this greatly reduces Bulgaria's territory, they will remain independent for now. Another war on the Balkans has been averted."
pact.19.a:0 "저들은 달리 선택지가 없다."
pact.19.b:0 "평화의 시간이로군."

pact.20.t:0 "제 4차 발칸전쟁"
pact.20.d:0 "The Bulgarian government refused an ultimatum of Serbia to hand over all territories they seized from us and our allies during the Weltkrieg. With no other option, the Serbian government has declared war. As we are part of the Belgrade Pact, we need to come to their aid. Though we will face stiff Bulgarian resistance, the Belgrade Pact surely will emerge victorious from this new conflict."
pact.20.a:0 "Onwards to victory!"

pact.21.t:0 "제 4차 발칸전쟁"
pact.21.d:0 "The Bulgarian government refused an ultimatum of Serbia to hand over all territories they seized from us and our allies during the Weltkrieg. With no other option, the Serbian government has declared war. As we are part of the Belgrade Pact, we are now obliged to enter the war with Bulgaria in order to reclaim Eastern Rumelia, if our armed forces are sufficient for the task ahead."
pact.21.a:0 "조약기구에 영광을."
pact.21.b:0 "우리가 너무 과대평가했다. 원조를 보내라"
pact.21.c:0 "우리가 할 수 있는건 없다"

pact.22.t:0 "오스만 제국이 불가리아 공격을 거부하였습니다"
pact.22.d:0 "Although it was an unlikely alliance, the Ottomans always assured us of their determination to help us in the fight against Bulgaria. But now that the war has started and we asked them to open the second front, their government has announced their withdrawal from the Belgrade Pact and stated that they will not intervene on either side in this war."
pact.22.a:0 "다음에 거래하도록하지."

pact.23.t:0 "The Ottoman Empire withdraws from the Belgrade Pact"
pact.23.d:0 "Although the Ottomans initially announced their support for Serbia, they have refused to honour their obligations and announced their withdrawal from the Belgrade Pact. The Ottoman government stated that they will not intervene on either side in this war."
pact.23.a:0 "Only good can come out of this."

pact.24.t:0 "The Ottoman Empire sends aid but won't join the war"
pact.24.d:0 "Although it was an unlikely alliance, the Ottomans always assured us of their determination to help us in the fight against Bulgaria. But now that the war has started and we asked them to open the second front, their government has announced they can only send some expeditionary forces and won't officially join the war against Bulgaria."
pact.24.a:0 "Of course they altered the deal."
pact.24.tt:0 "Ottoman troops and equipment arrive."

pact.25.t:0 "제 4차 발칸전쟁"
pact.25.d:0 "The Serbians have attacked Bulgaria together with their Belgrade Pact allies. We have promised to aid Bulgaria in the event of a conflict. Some argue we should directly intervene in favour of Bulgaria, but others say this will upset the precarious balance in the Middle East and might result in some of our neighbours declaring war on us. We can of course also ignore the conflict completely, but that would mean we don't help our former Central Powers ally."

pact.27.d:0 "In accordance to their earlier pledge to support us in the case of a war between Bulgaria and the Belgrade Pact, the Ottoman Empire has offered us a formal alliance. They state that they want to contain the aggression of the Pact and help us defend our country."

pact.29.a:0 "잘먹고 잘살아라!"

pact.30.t:0 "제 4차 발칸전쟁"
pact.30.d:0 "The Serbians have attacked Bulgaria together with their Belgrade Pact allies. We have promised to aid Bulgaria in the event of a conflict. Should we send volunteers, or ignore this new conflict? Some are arguing for the last option, seeing the internal problems we face."
pact.30.a:0 "불가리아에 원조를 보내라."
pact.30.b:0 "우리가 할 수 있는건 없다."

pact.31.t:0 "[From.GetName](이)가 우리를 돕는 것을 거부했습니다"
pact.31.d:0 "Although they had promised to support us in the case of a war between us and Serbia, the [From.GetAdjective] government has declared they cannot help us in the ongoing conflict between Bulgaria and the Belgrade Pact. This is a major outrage, and we will not forget this!"

pact.32.t:0 "제 4차 발칸전쟁"
pact.32.d:0 "The Balkans is once again engulfed by the flames of war. Serbia, eager to repay its defeat in the Weltkrieg, launched an assault together with its Belgrade Pact allies on Bulgaria. Who shall Russia support?"

However, it is not under our sector of Bulgaria, and is in Ottoman hands. Asking the Ottomans to give up the territory just after they got it would be humiliating for them but we do not want to spurn our new Greek allies either. What shall we do?"

While this good for the overall power of the Pact, the Serbs are calling on us to cede all of Thrace to the Greeks. Considering it was originally given to us as a part of our sector of Bulgaria, there is pressure to resist this and keep it. Shall we bow to the Serbian demand?"

pact.58.d:0 "The Serbian government will not pressure the Ottomans to cede Thrace to us. While we are now in an alliance together, it remains to be seen whether this will hold."
pact.58.a:0 "We will get it later."

pact.59.t:0 "The Ottomans won't cede Thrace"
pact.59.d:0 "The Serbians have pressured the Ottomans to cede Thrace to us but the Ottoman government has announced they will keep all the lands they have gained from Bulgaria. While we are now in an alliance together, it remains to be seen whether this will hold."
pact.59.a:0 "We will get it later."

pact.60.t:0 "[From.GetName] won't join the Belgrade Pact"
pact.60.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has announced they don't want to be part of the Belgrade Pact, not even when offered territorial concessions."
pact.60.a:0 "Unfortunate."

pact.61.t:0 "Status of Dobrudzha"
pact.61.d:0 "With the beginning of the occupation of Bulgaria we have been given the territory of Dobrudzha. This part of Bulgaria was taken from the Romanians after the Weltkrieg and we may be able to get them to join the Belgrade Pact in return for the area. Shall we send them an offer?"
pact.61.a:0 "Offer Dobrudzha to Romania."
pact.61.b:0 "It will be a part of our occupation zone."

pact.62.t:0 "Serbia offers Dobrudzha"
pact.62.d:0 "The Serbians have defeated Bulgaria and have come to us, offering Dobrudzha to us in return for allying with them. Regaining this province would calm the masses and increase our prestige abroad. Shall we accept the offer?"

pact.64.d:0 "The Bulgarians have been defeated and we have redeemed ourselves in the eyes of the world!

The majority of our military officers are calling for at least temporary military occupation of the whole of Bulgaria, while some claim that an occupation might be too costly for our weary nation to handle."
pact.64.a:0 "Divide Bulgaria into occupation zones!"
pact.64.b:0 "Let them have their independence."

pact.65.t:0 "[From.GetName] calls for joint occupation of Bulgaria"
pact.65.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has called for a joint occupation of the remaing lands of Bulgaria. In the future, a much smaller Bulgarian state may be carved out of these territories. For now we have the right to govern our occupation zone as we see, even plundering it from anything valueable."
pact.65.a:0 "Very well."
pact.65.b:0 "No, we keep our new lands!"

pact.66.t:0 "[From.GetName] refuses to set up occupation zones"
pact.66.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has refused our demand to set up occupation zones in the former Bulgarian territories.

pact.66.a:0 "This is outrageous!"

pact.67.t:0 "End of the occupation of Bulgaria"
pact.67.d:0 "The time has come to restore Bulgaria as an independent state. They will have to renounce all claims outside their core territory and will be controlled by [Root.GetAdj] government officals to ensure they will never again start such a destructive war."

pact.68.t:0 "End of the occupation of Bulgaria"
pact.68.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government have contacted us saying they wish to end the occupation of Bulgaria as 'it has been expundged of all wrongdoing'.

In return for giving them the remaining Bulgarian lands we are promised industrial reparations. Shall we agree with them?"
pact.68.a:0 "Agree, let this be a new beginning."
pact.68.b:0 "No, we keep the land for ourselves!"

pact.69.t:0 "Renouncing our claims"
pact.69.d:0 "We are forced to give up all claims on land outside our territory, but at least we are reestablished as an independent nation."
pact.69.a:0 "We have no choice."
