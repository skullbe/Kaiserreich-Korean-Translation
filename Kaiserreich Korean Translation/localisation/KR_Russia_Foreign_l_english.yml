RUS_real_politik:0 "외교 정책: 현실정치"
RUS_real_politik_desc:0 "Realpolitik is politics or diplomacy based primarily on considerations of given circumstances and factors, rather than explicit ideological notions or moral and ethical premises.

Every neighbouring state which is not a puppet of the Russian state is, as such, a threat or a target, depending on their military and political strength. Needless to say, this adaption of policies will not be well-liked by the rest of the world."

Obsessed with retaking Britain and wiping out syndicalists Churchill believes that helping in reforming Russian army and bureaucracy will lead to creation the 'steam-roller' running over the French revolutionaries. That view is shared to high degree by many officers, both low and high ranks.

rusfor.1273.t:0 "Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Central Asia."
rusfor.1273.d:0 "After the annexation of Central Asia, we got many new Muslim citizens, who were ruled before by the local obscurantist priests and preachers. It is obvious, that we have to do something with their legacy and turn our new citizens into loyal and peaceful members of the Russian society. Now we have two propositions - we can establish a special Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Central Asia or give an additional powers to the Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly, which is controlled by the loyal Tatars and Bashkirs."

rusfor.1273.b:0 "Orenburg Assembly will deal with it!"

rusfor.1274.t:0 "Problems in Central Asia."
rusfor.1274.d:0 "Though we have established a new Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Central Asia, but it is still controlled mainly by the same priests, who had been playing a significant role in Central Asia since the Civil war till the annexation. Of course we will have to change the situation here, but it will take us a lot of time."
rusfor.1274.a:0 "Oh well..."

rusfor.1275.t:0 "Pacification of Central Asia."
rusfor.1275.d:0 "Good news from Central Asia - new Tatar and Bashkir Muslim leadership could finally reorganise the system of the local Islamic institutions and partly defeat the obscurantism of the local notable theologians and preachers. Now Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly proposes a new vision of Islam for the Central Asian citizens, which means, that Central Asia will be loyal enough to us and we will be able to pay less attention to this region of Russia."
rusfor.1275.a:0 "That's great!"

rusfor.1276.t:0 "Control over Azerbaijan"
rusfor.1276.d:0 "Since we have given our guarantees to Azerbaijan, the Russian business uses the profits of the cooperation between two countries. Maybe now it is the best time to expand our control over this Caucasian country and strengthen our positions in the Caspian region?"
rusfor.1276.a:0 "Let's do it!"
rusfor.1276.b:0 "We don't need it."

rusfor.1277.t:0 "Restoring control over the Northern Caucasus."
rusfor.1277.d:0 "After the reunification of Don-Kuban with Russia, our government faced the problem of integration of the eastern mountainous districts of the former Cossack state. During the 1920s and early 1930s Ataman Krasnov supported the Terek Cossack Host, which consisted of many Russians, Ossetians and other Christian nations, who kept this part of the Caucasus under Yekaterinodar's control. We have currently deployed the Russian army in the region, but this is a temporary measure. Multiple plans for the reconstruction and pacification of the region have been proposed and we should choose one of them."
rusfor.1277.a:0 "Put the region under control of the local civilian Russians."
rusfor.1277.b:0 "Continue Krasnov's policy - support the Terek Cossack Host and its nations."
rusfor.1277.c:0 "Keep the region under military control!"

rusfor.1278.t:0 "The order in the Northern Caucasus is partially restored."
rusfor.1278.d:0 "After we had restored military bases in such towns of the Northern Caucasus as Vladikavkaz and Grozny and had left here the limited part of the troops, we have transfered the control over this territory to the local Russians, who had been both members of the Terek Cossack Host or just citizens in the various towns and villages. It seems that while the Russian part of the region has started to recover very quick, the districts without Russian involvement are sliding into the anarchy and tribal wars. Now many leaders of the non-Russian nations of the Northern Caucasus ask us to restore control over the whole region and promise that they will serve well to the Russian government, since it is the only power, which can secure the region from the eternal crisis."
rusfor.1278.a:0 "We should have expected it."

rusfor.1279.t:0 "The order in the Northern Caucasus is partially restored."
rusfor.1279.d:0 "Since we started to support the Terek Cossack Host, we could reach an order rather quick, but because our support exceeded the extent of the support from Krasnov's government, the Host started to expand itself over the non-Christian territory of the eastern part of the Northern Caucasus, which naturally led to the multiple conflicts, especially between the Russians and Ossetians on one side and the Chechens and Ingushes on the other. Moreover, the readiness of the Russian government to deal with the local small nations and tribes led to conflicts with them in Dagestan, where many nations want to become a junior partner of Russia and dominate over their neighbours using Russian protection. All these conflicts will be solved by our government, but it will take some time."
rusfor.1279.a:0 "We should have expected it."

rusfor.1280.t:0 "The order in the Northern Caucasus is partially restored."
rusfor.1280.d:0 "We kept the army deployed in the eastern part of the Northern Caucasus and it brought the order to the Russian part of this land, where the local citizens are finally free from the raids and attacks of the mountainous nations. But in the non-Russian parts of the region only some Christian nations support our army, while in some Muslim villages the local people try to start a guerrilla against Russia. No doubt we will stop it and punish the criminals, but it will take some time."
rusfor.1280.a:0 "We should have expected it."

rusfor.1281.t:0 "The order in the Northern Caucasus is restored."
rusfor.1281.d:0 "More than six months have passed since we had retaken Don-Kuban Union. We could finally restore control over the whole region and set up a new local authorities, which help us to pacify Northern Caucasus. The local Russians and other Christian nations have strengthened their positions and are finally free from raids and attacks of the hostile tribes, rebellious nations accepted our rule and the criminals who fought against us either died or immigrated. The new era of the prosperity in the Russian South finally starts!"
rusfor.1281.a:0 "Perfect!"

rusfor.1282.t:0 "Integration of Don-Kuban Union."
rusfor.1282.d:0 "We reunified the lands of Don-Kuban Union, but it will take us some time to reorganise the conscription system in the region and check which officers of the old Don-Kuban army can serve in the Russian army."
rusfor.1282.a:0 "Ok."

rusfor.1283.t:0 "Integration of Alash Orda."
rusfor.1283.d:0 "We reunified the lands of Alash Orda, but it will take us some time to reorganise the economy, ruined by the incompetent Alash government."
rusfor.1283.a:0 "Ok."

rusfor.1284.t:0 "Integration of Turkestan."
rusfor.1284.d:0 "We reunified the lands of Turkestan, but it will take us some time to recover the local industry and infrastructure."

rusfor.1285.t:0 "Integration of Belorussia."
rusfor.1285.d:0 "We reunified the lands of Belorussia, but it will take us some time to improve the living standards in this region."
rusfor.1285.a:0 "Ok."

rusfor.1286.t:0 "Integration of Eastern Ukraine."
rusfor.1286.d:0 "We reunified the lands of Eastern Ukraine, but it will take us some time to modernise the local industry and give the people here jobs."
rusfor.1286.a:0 "Ok."

rusfor.1287.t:0 "Integration of Western Ukraine."
rusfor.1287.d:0 "We reunified the lands of Western Ukraine, but it will take us some time to establish Russian control over the local villages, where some supporters of independence are still active."
rusfor.1287.a:0 "Ok."

rusfor.1288.t:0 "Integration of United Baltic Duchy."
rusfor.1288.d:0 "We reunified the lands of Baltic region, but it will take us some time to identify and eliminate the many German spies among the local elite."
rusfor.1288.a:0 "Ok."

rusfor.1289.t:0 "Fergana Valley Captured!"
rusfor.1289.d:0 "We have finally seized control of the most densely populated and developed part of Turkestan! It's the time to demand an annexation of the whole country!"
