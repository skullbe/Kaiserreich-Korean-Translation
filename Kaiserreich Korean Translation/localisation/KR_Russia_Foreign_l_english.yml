### Focuses ###
RUS_real_politik:0 "Foreign Policy: Realpolitik"
RUS_real_politik_desc:0 "Realpolitik is politics or diplomacy based primarily on considerations of given circumstances and factors, rather than explicit ideological notions or moral and ethical premises. The term Realpolitik is sometimes used pejoratively to imply politics that are coercive, amoral, or Machiavellian. We enjoy this notion."
RUS_expansionism:0 "Foreign Policy: Expansionism"
RUS_expansionism_desc:0 "The theory of expansionism constitutes that Russia's borders are only as safe as they are distant from our heartland. Every neighbouring state which is not a puppet of the Russian state is, as such, a threat or a target, depending on their military and political strength. Needless to say, this adaption of policies will not be well-liked by the rest of the world."
expansionism_tooltip_russia:0 "§GBy taking Expansionism, you will have more aggressive options in the diplomatic events and focuses, but you will increase world tension and anger the countries around you!§!"

RUS_caucasus_focus_desc:0 "The Caucasus is wealthy and, historically, part of Russia. The people who live there might not think so anymore, but with enough military muscles that shouldn't be a problem. Germany will however keep a close eye on us, and we should tread carefully in the region."
RUS_don_cossack_status:0 "The Question of the Don-Kuban Union"
RUS_don_cossack_status_desc:0 "The Don-Kuban region is as Russian as Russia, or so our military staff claims. They also claim that while the Cossacks who reside there are hard men, they aren't hard enough to fight from horse-back against our modern, unstoppable armies."

RUS_advantage_GER_war_caucasus:0 "Germany is busy, demand Concessions!"
RUS_advantage_GER_war_caucasus_desc:0 "With Germany locked in a deadly new Weltkrieg it is time for us to push for concessions in the Caucasus region. Surely the Germans do not want a new two-front war?"

RUS_central_asia_focus:0 "Central Asian Direction"
RUS_central_asia_focus_desc:0 "Unlike the Caucasus region, there is no German interest in the central Asian provinces. We should be able to grab them without much opposition from the great powers."

RUS_middle_east_focus:0 "Middle East Direction"
RUS_middle_east_focus_desc:0 "With central Asia and the Caucasus region under our control, we can look to the wealthy and strategically important middle east.

RUS_greater_armenia:0 "Ask for Greater Armenia"
RUS_greater_armenia_desc:0 "There are still regions inside the Ottoman Empire considered Armenian in terms of geography and culture. To see our brothers of faith oppressed by our ancient enemy will not do."
RUS_crush_turkey:0 "Secure the Straits: Crush Turkey!"
RUS_crush_turkey_desc:0 "The Ottomans have been an enemy of the Russians for as long as our nations have existed. A part of the negotiations with the Entente during the Weltkrieg, we were to receive Constantinople and restore it as a capital of the Orthodox faith after the war, had we won.

RUS_take_baghdad:0 "Secure the Cradle of Civilisation"

RUS_far_east_focus:0 "Far East Direction"

RUS_plebiscite_transamur_desc:0 "With the Russian state gaining control over the once disputed Trans-Siberian railroad from Mongolia, commercial contacts have increased massively with the Transamur Republic. The leaders of its influential business community have approached the our government in secret, suggesting that they could probably organise a popular vote to return to Russia."
RUS_crush_transamur:0 "Claim Transamur"
RUS_crush_transamur_desc:0 "With the Russian state gaining control over the once disputed Trans-Siberian railroad from Mongolia, commercial contacts have increased massively with the Transamur Republic.

RUS_claim_manchuria:0 "Manchurian Interest"
RUS_claim_manchuria_desc:0 "Manchuria, now a large and wealthy puppet of Japan, lies before us, and at its south lies Port Arthur, the legitimate Russian port in the Yellow Sea. We must take back this port and rule over Manchuria to assert our dominance over north-eastern China."
RUS_rebuild_vladivostok:0 "Rebuild the Vladivostok Port"
RUS_rebuild_vladivostok_desc:0 "The Vladivostok port will be crucial to any warfare with Japan. Now that it is once again in Russian hands after over twenty years of Japanese influence, we can prepare a massive build up."

RUS_befriend_mongolia_desc:0 "The 'Mad Baron' has turned out to be more amiable than we expected. While he is unstable, he could be useful to is as he sows chaos in the far East. Should we try and strike a deal with him?"

RUS_eastern_europe_focus:0 "European Direction"
RUS_eastern_europe_focus_desc:0 "The greatest losses of the Weltkrieg was, in all honesty, not in the East or the South. It was losing our most industrialised regions of the west. It's time they are returned to their rightful owners."
RUS_buy_state_bonds_WHR:0 "Buy State Bonds in White Ruthenia"
RUS_buy_state_bonds_WHR_desc:0 "White Ruthenia sells its state bonds. We have enough money to conclude an agreement about the purchase of almost all their state bonds, and if they agree with it, we will be able to control their economy, their government and maybe will incorporate them later."
RUS_intervene_second_weltkrieg:0 "Intervene in the Second Weltkrieg!"
RUS_intervene_second_weltkrieg_desc:0 "Growing tensions between the German Empire and the Commune of France has erupted into full scale war.

RUS_ask_germany_syndie_ukraine_desc:0 "Ukraine, a former territory of Russia has fallen to the Syndicalists.

RUS_claim_bessarabia_desc:0 "On the other side of the Dniester River lies Bessarabia.

Perhaps we can pressure the weak Romanian government to surrender us the region, securing Odessa from direct threats?"
RUS_crush_finland:0 "Bring Finland to its Knees"
RUS_crush_finland_desc:0 "Finland and their false King has mocked Russia for long enough. It's time we send Russian troops to Helsinki once again."
RUS_demand_karelia:0 "Demand Karelia"

rusfor.1.d:0 "Now, with our reign firmly established, we can begin to consider our stance regarding the rest of the world. Russia should start being more active on the world stage, but we are too weak to interfere in the German or Japanese spheres of influence. The Caucasus, bordering the dying Ottoman Empire, is an easy region to subjugate and has large oil deposits for us to exploit. Central Asia, with its unstable situation between the Alash Orda and Turkestan, seems an even easier target. We should secure these areas before shifting our gaze anywhere else."

rusfor.2.t:0 "The Security of our Eastern Borders"
rusfor.2.d:0 "Russia has recaptured the positions in the Caucasus their Empire has held before. This, and the recent surge of Arabian nationalism, originating from Egypt and Hashemite Arabia, puts our state and its foreign interest in grave danger. To have any hope to survive the approaching struggles with our hostile Arabian neighbours, we must quickly stabilise our eastern borders. The Sultan plans to send Prince Nihad to propose a non-aggression treaty with Russia."

Both sides of the pact are to recognise the current state of the border between the Ottoman Empire and Russia. How shall we respond to this proposal?"

Pre-revolutionary First Lord of Navy and Minister of War Winston Churchill has become a leader of "Association for Better Canadian - Russian Relations" and it is widely believed that he would be an chief of mission to Russia if one was sent. Obsessed with retaking Britain and wiping out syndicalists Churchill believes that helping in reforming Russian army and bureaucracy will lead to creation the 'steam-roller' running over the French revolutionaries. That view is shared to high degree by many officers, both low and high ranks. What's more Canadian corporations are expecting large profits from investment in Russian underdeveloped market, in which demand for high-technological machinery is enormous."

It is widely speculated that Canadian companies will invest large sums of money in our high-technology companies and factories crucial for warfare."
rusfor.29.a:0 "It will strengthen the Entente!"

rusfor.30.t:0 "Canadian companies are investing!"
rusfor.30.d:0 "One of the advantages of being in the Entente is a high interest of Canadian corporations and firms in our market.

rusfor.35.d:0 "Many Russian citizens disapprove the alliance we have with Japan. They don't realise the unlimited possibilities of two emerging superpowers marching together to spread the democracy and civilisation but they prefer believing the anti-Japanese propaganda which is unfortunately popular in our country. Government must use it's powers and show ordinary Russian folks that Japan is not wild country populated by 'Chinks' or 'yellow monkeys' but rather modern superpower interested in alliance with democratic Russia. Creating a formal bloc would be also a signal to other world superpowers as Canada or Germany that bond between Japan and Russia is indissoluble."

rusfor.1247.d:0 "The German government is either too proud or too stupid to accept our offer but they want to sign a non-aggression pact instead. What we will tell them?"

rusfor.1248.t:0 "Russia wants to join the Syndicalists"
rusfor.1248.d:0 "The Russian government has announced recently that they want to join the Syndicalist bloc.

rusfor.1265.d:0 "White Ruthenia was occupied by the Germans in 1918 and later Berlin installed a loyal regime with the German prince on the top. But even now the White Ruthenian economy is unstable and weak, if we compare it with the other Eastern European countries. We can reach an agreement about the purchase of almost all their state bonds, and if they agree with it, we will be able to control their economy, their government and maybe will incorporate them later."
rusfor.1265.a:0 "Let's buy them!"
rusfor.1265.b:0 "We shall take back our stolen lands by force!"
rusfor.1265.c:0 "We don't need them"

rusfor.1266.b:0 "Maybe the Germans will be able to help us."

rusfor.1269.t:0 "White Ruthenia needs our help!"
rusfor.1269.d:0 "The government of White Ruthenia wants our support, because Russia is going to buy their state bonds to control the economy of this small country. It seems that if we don't intervene, White Ruthenia will be soon annexed by the Russians!"
rusfor.1269.a:0 "Warn Russia, they must turn back!"
rusfor.1269.b:0 "They can do what they want."

rusfor.1270.t:0 "Germany supports White Ruthenia!"

rusfor.1271.b:0 "We will fight alone!"

rusfor.1272.t:0 "White Ruthenia is alone!"
rusfor.1272.d:0 "The German government doesn't want to protect White Ruthenia. But White Ruthenia isn't going to sell us their state bonds. Maybe we should take back our lands, using our army?"
rusfor.1272.a:0 "Let's do it!"
rusfor.1272.b:0 "We don't need White Ruthenia."

rusfor.12722.t:0 "Russia is threatening our hold on White Ruthenia!"
rusfor.12722.d:0 "Russia offered our puppet White Ruthenia to buy some of its state bonds and is now going to control most of its economy. Unfortunately the White Ruthenian government accepted this offer and Russia is now closer than ever from annexing White Ruthenia to their empire for good. Should we intervene?"
rusfor.12722.a:0 "Unacceptable! We'll take back our puppet!"
rusfor.12722.b:0 "They can do what they want."

rusfor.1273.t:0 "Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Central Asia."
rusfor.1273.d:0 "After the annexation of Central Asia, we got many new Muslim citizens, who were ruled before by the local obscurantist priests and preachers. It is obvious, that we have to do something with their legacy and turn our new citizens into loyal and peaceful members of the Russian society. Now we have two propositions - we can establish a special Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Central Asia or give an additional powers to the Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly, which is controlled by the loyal Tatars and Bashkirs."
rusfor.1273.a:0 "Create a new Spiritual Administration."
rusfor.1273.b:0 "Orenburg Assembly will deal with it!"

rusfor.1274.t:0 "Problems in Central Asia."
rusfor.1274.d:0 "Though we have established a new Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Central Asia, but it is still controlled mainly by the same priests, who had been playing a significant role in Central Asia since the Civil war till the annexation. Of course we will have to change the situation here, but it will take us a lot of time."
rusfor.1274.a:0 "Oh well"

rusfor.1275.t:0 "Pacification of Central Asia."
rusfor.1275.d:0 "Good news from Central Asia - new Tatar and Bashkir Muslim leadership could finally reorganise the system of the local Islamic institutions and partly defeat the obscurantism of the local notable theologians and preachers. Now Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly proposes a new vision of Islam for the Central Asian citizens, which means, that Central Asia will be loyal enough to us and we will be able to pay less attention to this region of Russia."
rusfor.1275.a:0 "That's great!"
