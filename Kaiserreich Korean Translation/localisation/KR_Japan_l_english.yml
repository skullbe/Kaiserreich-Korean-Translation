### Leader Descriptions ###
POLITICS_HIROHITO_DESC:0 "Assuming the Crysanthemum throne after the death of his father, Emperor Taishō, His Imperial Majesty represents a divine dynasty of nearly 2,500 years; his personage seen not only as head of state, but as representative of the very heart, soul, and being of the nation. As both militarists and a resurgent left thrive amidst mounting domestic chaos, the Emperor remains silent, his role unclear and undecided. However, when and if the Emperor does make his move, it will no doubt be decisive."

japdom.1.t:0 "Recovering from the Lost Decade"
japdom.1.d:0 "In what has come to be called the 'Lost Decade', the 1920's were marked by economic depression and political instability in Japan. The plight was particularly severe in the agricultural sector and caused a massive demographic change as farmers fled from the depressed countryside to urban areas, flooding the labour market, and further driving down wages. \n\n After leaving the Kenseikai-led 'Constitutionalist Coalition' and taking charge of the Government, Inukai and his cabinet successfully expanded the Japanese sphere of influence into Manchuria and the edges of Siberia, acquiring a vital export market for the Japanese economy, but the agricultural situation continued to deteriorate as cheap agricultural imports from Manchuria bled into the countryside. As 1936 dawns, continued rearmament and state investment has fully rebuilt the industrial economy, but the issue of rural poverty remains chronic and unsolved."

japdom.2.a:0 "Very well."

japdom.3.t:0 "General Election 1936"
japdom.3.d:0 "After the Constitutional Restoration of 1926 and subsequent political realignment, two parties came to dominate Japanese politics: the conservative Rikken Seiyukai (Association of Friends of Constitutional Government) and the liberal Minseito (Democratic Party). \n\n The Rikken Seiyukai has an absolute majority from the general election of 1932, but support in the countryside (Their traditional voting base) has been declining. As the political atmosphere turned against the ruling party, the Minseito, known as the Kenseikai (Constitutional Government Association) before 1927, solidified its electoral base throughout the cities and began to expand into the countryside, hoping to break the Seiyukai's absolute majority in the Diet. A new, third player in the general election of 1936 is the Shakai Taishuto (Socialist Masses Party), founded by social democrats and syndicalists in 1933. \n\n It is now time to see if the Seiyukai have retained enough seats to keep an absolute majority..."
japdom.3.a:0 "The Seiyukai have defended their absolute majority!"
japdom.3.b:0 "The Seiyukai have lost their absolute majority!"

japdom.4.t:0 "The Assassination of Katayama Sen"
japdom.4.d:0 "Born in 1859, Katayama Sen was one of the most senior syndicalist leaders in Japan, known as the 'father of Japanese syndicalism'. Exiled to the USA after participating in the early social democratic movement, Katayama witnessed and was influenced by Jack Reed's syndicalist activities and the development of the IWW into the CSA. Katayama returned to Japan after the Constitutional Restoration of 1926 and founded the first legal syndicalist party in Japan, the Rodo-Nominto (Labour-Farmer Party), and after the party was declared illegal in 1932, he formed another party called the Shakai Taishuto (Socialist Masses Party), an amalgamation of social democratic parties and syndicalist movements. Yesterday, while visiting Kyoto to congratulate Taishuto member Yamamoto Senji on his election, a gang of three right-wingers stormed his office and beat the two men with clubs. Yamamoto survived, but Katayama, aged 75, never regained consciousness and died earlier today."
japdom.4.a:0 "This will be bad..."

japdom.5.t:0 "Friction Within the Japanese Left"
japdom.5.d:0 "The shock of the assassination of Katayama Sen initially united the Shakai Taishuto in solidarity against the "white terror", but the unity did not last long. The party was originally structured as a coalition of various social democrat and syndicalist organisations, only united in the goal of 'socialisation of the economic structure with the proletariat at its foundation'. Before his death, Katayama had guided the party away from ideological clashes, but deprived of its leader the party was forced to face the question of its precise ideological position, and infighting soon began. \n\n Throughout the spring of 1936, national-syndicalists, called the Nichirokei (Japan-Labour Clique), adopted Totalism and vigorously expanded its membership, not only inside the party at expense of the moderate Shaminkei (Social Democratic Clique) but also outside the party, notably within the Shaminkei-controlled Nihon Rodo Sodomei (Japan General Federation of Labour). Soon an open fight between the two groups broke out. The Nichirokei accused the Sodomei of being run by 'the labour bureaucrat establishment', and in turn the Sodomei and the Shaminkei accused the Nichirokei of hijacking and turning labour organisations into their puppets. The Nichirokei's members were expelled from both the Sodomei and the Taishuto earlier this month, and the group is now operating independently."

japdom.7.t:0 "Restorationists and Centralists"
japdom.7.d:0 "The 'Ishinha', restoration faction is a political ideology promoted by radical junior officers, characterised by its anti-capitalism, anti-oligarchism and anti-parliamentarism. Usually coming from underprivileged and/or humble backgrounds, many of these officers have experienced poverty from childhood and observed what they considered the evil influence of favouritism, leading them to believe that the establishment has hijacked power from the Emperor and is leading the nation into the abyss. The Restorationist solution was to sweep out the ruling establishment and restore all power back to the Emperor, and from there a complete national reform was to be initiated. Against them are the 'Chuuha', the central faction, who were close to the central military leadership who supported cooperation with the establishment, and the militarisation of politics."

He calls for expanding our mobilisation capability, modernising equipment, and centralising the command structure.\n\nGeneral Obata's analysis is nearly identical, but he has come to a different conclusion; due to volatile international tensions, war would come to Japan before the country could ever achieve such a capacity through internal development. Accordingly, he came to the conclusion that in future wars, the IJA must seek the quick destruction of hostile forces by waging war through short, rapid, and decisive operations, to avoid a long war.\n\nBoth agree a centralised command structure is a good idea, and that raw manpower tactics are a poor strategy; we can never hope to compete with Russian or Chinese manpower. We may now choose how to proceed."

Accordingly, he came to the conclusion that in future wars, the IJA must seek the quick destruction of hostile forces by waging war through short, rapid, and decisive operations, to avoid a long war.

japdom.9.t:0 "The National Security Act"
japdom.9.d:0 "The notorious Peace Preservation Act was introduced in early 1924 by the Tanaka regime amidst the red scare following the Kanto anarchist uprising in September 1923 and a syndicalist's assassination attempt on then-Crown Prince Hirohito in December of the same year. The Act drastically limited civil rights and symbolised the draconian rule of General Tanaka. It was repealed when the regime was brought down by the Constitutional Restoration of 1926, but Prime Minister Suzuki Kisaburo now wants to reintroduce the Act, albeit heavily moderated and renamed the 'National Security Act'. He has met strong opposition even within his own cabinet, and public opinion has dropped to a new low, but Suzuki believes its reintroduction is a necessary step to counter the rising tide of syndicalism, and he is not alone in his opinion. A cross-party parliamentary group led by Nakajima Chikuhei of the Rikken Seiyukai and Adachi Kenzo of the Minseito have declared the Act as the 'last bulwark of constitutional government' and support its passage. The House of Peers and the Privy Council are also in favour of the Act."

Before the end of their trial a petition arrived at court, containing over 350,000 signatures in blood from sympathisers around the country, pleading for a lenient sentence. In addition to the petition, the court also received a request from eleven youths in Niigata, asking that they be executed in place of the Navy officers, and sending eleven severed fingers to the court as a gesture of their sincerity! The whole trial was unpopular enough to convince the court to accelerate the process, and although the death sentences were issued just yesterday, the assassins were executed at dawn today."

japdom.14.d:0 "The downfall of Suzuki stunned the Rikken Seiyukai, and an emergency convention was called. The bureaucratic Tokonami faction (named after Tokonami Takejiro (1867-1935), chairman of the pro-Tanaka Seiyu Honto during the Tanaka dictatorship and its aftermath) has been crippled by the loss of their leader, leaving the reactionary Nakajima faction to take control of the party. From his new post as Director of General Affairs, Nakajima enjoys decision-making power over the entire party, but has stopped short of crowning himself chairman and instead elected current Prime Minister and Tokonami-aligned Mizuno Rentaro instead."

This morning, the coup forces seized the Metropolitan Police Headquarters, the Prime Minister's Residence, and the new Imperial Diet Building, but failed to occupy the Imperial Palace. To the surprise of the plotters, the Emperor resisted the coup d'état and issued an imperial command to suppress the rebels, sealing their fate. The coup forces surrendered without resistance and key conspirators were quickly caught, while some took their own lives before they could be arrested.

To this end, not only must Japan's economic structure be reorganised along a militarist line, but the Japanese people must be 'ideologically enlightened' to abandon self-interest.

The movement's immediate goal is the combination of all political perspectives into one party- the Imperial Rule Assistance Society (Taisei Yokusankai)."
japdom.25.a:0 "This is the way we should go forward"

japdom.26.t:0 "The First Convention of the Taisei Yokusankai"
japdom.26.d:0 "The Taisei Yokusankai, or Imperial Rule Assistance Society, is structured as a new political core institution that will represent every aspect of society, unlike the old 'plutocratic' Imperial Diet. It will branch out into every administrative level from hamlet to prefecture, and create a core group consisting of talented individuals from academic, cultural, economic, governmental, military, political, and all other professional occupations. In theory, by penetrating to the grass-roots level a direct link between politics and the people will be established, and by having every important interest group represented at its core it would be possible to coordinate and develop effective national policy. Sadly, that vision has already collapsed, as the various movements the Taisei Yokusankai was meant to bind together have already begun to argue and compete for control of the society. Three main groups have emerged at the convention. The leading group is the Kakushinha (Reformist Faction) headed by none other than Prince Konoe himself, composed of reform-minded intellectuals and politicians. The second group is the Kodoha (Imperial Way Faction), named after General Araki's frequent usage of the word 'Imperial Way', or 'Kodo', composed of reserve or active Restorationist military leaders. Third is the Yokuseiha, mainly composed of former parliamentary politicians who sympathised with the Restorationist cause. The name 'Yokuseiha' originated from an abbreviation of a political association of Restorationist sympathisers, the Yokusan Seijikai (Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association). The latter two object to the Kakushinha's forceful agenda, and even question the purpose of the Taisei Yokusankai. Konoe had designed the Taisei Yokusankai as a central nervous system of the upcoming 'New System', combining all legislative, executive and administrative powers into one. Konoe assured that the old Meiji Constitution would remain as it is and the Taisei Yokusankai would not replace the Imperial Diet, but the very idea of the political leviathan has met with vigorous opposition."

japdom.30.d:0 "Prime Minister Hiranuma has taken the blame for the fiasco in Korea and announced a general election. Only candidates endorsed by the Taisei Yokusankai stand a chance of winning. Effectively reduced into a rubber stamp, the newly elected Imperial Diet will convene in December 1937."

japdom.32.t:0 "A Party Divided"
japdom.32.d:0 "During the Rikken Seiyukai convention of 1936, Nakajima had felt his leading role was insecure and made power-sharing agreements with other factions. One such agreement was that the powerful post of the Secretary-General would remain vacant (but not abolished), with its tasks transferred to the collective leadership of the General Council. Last month, believing he had solidified his position, Nakajima attempted complete his domination by capturing the office of Secretary-General. To this end, he formally advised the General Council to return the post to former Secretary-General Kuhara Fusanosuke, who sympathised with the Reformists, and on April 28th Nakajima and his clique formed the 'Kakushin Domei' (Reformist Alliance), effectively a party within a party, pressing the General Council even further. After the general election had concluded, on May 14th the pro-Nakajima chairman of the General Council Horikiri Zenbe forced the issue to a vote within the Council, but the motion was vetoed by all other factions. Isolated within the upper echelons, the Reformists tried to overcome the situation by calling a convention to mobilise their local party cadres, but this was turned down by all other non-Reformist leaders again, frustrating Nakajima even more. Today, just a month after the election, the Kakushin Domei formally declared its independence from the Rikken Seiyukai."

We mainly export raw silk and other consumer goods- our industrial goods are still inadequate compared with most western nations.

japdom.51.t:0 "Tokko Officers accused of Torture"
japdom.51.d:0 "The Tokko, or 'Special Higher Police', is a police force specialising in social and thought crimes. The Tokko is also notorious for its abusive and brutal methods of interrogation, sometimes even resulting in death. When the National Security Act was passed, the Tokko rapidly expanded its size and operation, and their regard for the safety of accused criminals declined even further. Today a major newspaper has reported that a man died while in custody, and has accused the Tokko of torturing the victim to death."
japdom.51.a:0 "Oh no..."

japdom.52.t:0 "The Repeal of the National Security Act"
japdom.52.d:0 "The increasing excesses and abuses of the National Security Act has forced politicians to reconsider its worth. The Act served its purpose and saved a lot of lives from terrorism, but maybe it has outlived its usefulness."

japdom.53.t:0 "The Great Drought of 1939"
japdom.53.d:0 "The country is in the middle of the worst drought it has seen in this century. Water supplies are critically low and crops are dying of thirst. In some regions, local officials are organising rainmaking rituals in a desperate attempt to evoke storms and calm the people, but to no avail. Fortunately, the drought is mostly affecting southern Korea, western Honshu and the southern islands, and although rice harvests have dropped significantly no state of famine has developed. However, the disruption to food production from the drought is severe enough to force us to close down several rice exchanges, including the famous Dojima Rice Exchange, and control the rice supply directly, at least for the time being."

However, the Ministry of Colonial Affairs has come forward with a proposition in which Fengtian could be coerced into exporting millet and rice to Korea, with Korea then providing its own rice to feed Japan. Manchuria has largely been spared the drought, and while it would have to make do with less food for some time, our political and economic stranglehold over the country should be enough to prevent any dissent."

japdom.65.t:0 "The Emperor and Democracy"
japdom.65.d:0 "The government is weak, so in a desperate move, have asked the Emperor to speak. He has gone before parliament in a rare appearance and fortunately has supported the government. His words carry great weight, and may be enough to keep the government afloat. Do we agree with his support, or argue against him?"
japdom.65.a:0 "Lets us agree with the Emperor."
japdom.65.b:0 "He is out of line!"

japdom.72.t:0 "The Emperor and Democracy"
japdom.72.d:0 "The government is weak, so in a desperate move, have asked the Emperor to speak. He has gone before parliament in a rare appearance but he has refused to support the government. His words carry great weight, and this lack of support may be a fatal blow. Without intervention the government will surely fall, do we agree with his support, or argue against him?"
japdom.72.a:0 "Lets us agree with the Emperor."
japdom.72.b:0 "He is out of line!"

japdom.66.t:0 "Political Resistance"
japdom.66.d:0 "Though people say they are willing to lay down their life for the emperor, putting that to the test has been less successful than we would have liked. There has been political resistance to our mass mobilisation campaign, and while it is pushing ahead as planned, it has weakened out political position."
japdom.66.a:0 "I see."

japdom.67.t:0 "Decreasing Quality"
japdom.67.d:0 "Our third phase of mobilisation is underway, but already we have discovering that these new recruits aren't up to standard, but it is to late to turn back, all we can do is hope combat trains them well."

japdom.68.a:0 "I hope you are right."

japdom.69.t:0 "Another Disagreement"
japdom.69.d:0 "Nagata and Obata have had another argument. They nearly came to blows with one another, and now, once again, they are refusing to work together. While we are sure this will soon be resolved, in the mean time the army are without leadership. We must be careful with the political situation to avoid things like this."
japdom.69.a:0 "I hope you are right."

japdom.70.t:0 "Yet More Fighting"
japdom.70.d:0 "Nagata and Obata have had yet another argument. This time they declared each other to be the greatest threat Japan has ever faced, and once more they are refusing to work together. While we are sure this will soon be resolved, in the mean time the army are without leadership. Fortunately, those close to them say they have nearly reaching a compromise, so hopefully this will be the last argument they have."
japdom.70.a:0 "I hope you are right."

japdom.71.t:0 "Beta of an Alpha MkII"
japdom.71.d:0 "The bad news is the the foreign policy rework was not completed in time for 0.5, but that doesn't mean I have been idle, while the focus tree may look the same, the events behind it have been reworked totally, as well as new ones added. Things should be clearer now and flow better, not to mention bugs being fixed.\n\nAs before, Japan is not as polished or tested as other nations, so bugs are expected. That being said, I hope you still enjoy it, and bug reports and feedback are even more appreciated than normal!"
japdom.71.a:0 "Got it!"
