POL_absolutism_desc:0 "Poland was weak without a monarch at the helm of the nation. We need to ensure this never happens again, and the power of the monarch must be absolute if Poland is to be great again."
POL_reform_the_monarchy_desc:0 "The nation stands fractured and weak, by reforming the monarchy and reducing the power of the King, we stand to bring the nation into the modern era."
POL_abolish_the_council_desc:0 "The Sejm is a weak and dying institution, and their "elections" only serve to further fracture and divide the people. We need to do away with this relic of the past, and rest all power in the hands of the monarch."
POL_citizens_rights_desc:0 "Drafting a new set of laws to empower the citizens of the nation will result in a more educated, loyal, and productive population."
POL_a_centralized_state_desc:0 "The monarch is the final authority on all matters of state, and the Szlachta only serve to undermine his authority. By undercutting the authority of the nobles, and stalling them at every turn, we stand to reduce their power in the nation and strengthen the King's position."
POL_a_new_sejm_desc:0 "The Sejm has remained unchanged since the nation's resurrection at the end of the Weltkrieg. There are numerous loopholes and inefficiencies that could be rectified by reconstituting the Sejm, and would benefit the nation greatly."
POL_poland_lithuania_desc:0 "Recreating the Commonwealth will help both our nations."
POL_minority_rights_desc:0 "There are many unprotected minorities residing in the Kingdom of Poland, and by giving them special protections under the law, the nation only serves to grow stronger."
POL_a_new_constitution_desc:0 "With a new Polish King comes a new era in Poland's history, and with it must come a new set of laws. Drafting a new constitution is the first step in defining this new era in Poland's history."

POL_russian_support_desc:0 "Poland desperately lacks friends and allies on the international stage, and we are out of options. The Russian Republic to the East is forming a new power bloc in Europe, and it may be to our advantage to seek Russia's protection, no matter how humiliating it might be."
POL_naval_interdiction_desc:0 "Rather than rebuilding a traditional navy, a process that may take decades, we should instead focus on precision strikes, to hit the enemy where it hurts most."
POL_unrestircted_submarine_warfare_desc:0 "We should look to examples of the past to plan our future. Unrestricted Submarine Warfare has proven to be brutally effective in the past, and there is no reason it cannot work for us in the present."
POL_a_new_navy_desc:0 "If we are to stand proud among the great nations of Europe again, we must build a new, modern navy that can challenge the great powers of Europe and the world."

POL_naval_industry_desc:0 "Having retaken the historic city of Gdansk, we must use its massive ports and naval infrastructure to build a new Baltic fleet that will be the envy of Europe."
POL_gdansk_agreement_desc:0 "Our diplomatic position is stronger than it has ever been in the past 20 years. We must leverage this advantage to send a diplomatic envoy to Berlin, requesting the return of the rightful territory of Plotzk to the Polish people. It is unlikely to succeed, but there is no harm in trying..."

POL_the_stab_in_the_back_desc:0 "Poland was promised many things during the Weltkrieg, and we were given almost nothing, reduced to a small shell of a nation, weak and ineffectual in our ambitions. We have been stabbed in the back by our so called "allies", and it is time for Poland to take what is hers."
POL_militarism_desc:0 "The people of Poland have been cheated out of what we were rightfully owed, and they know it. We must whip the people into a frenzy of nationalism, so that we may fill our ranks with proud soldiers to fuel the coming conflicts."

POL_cossack_alliance_desc:0 "Syndicalists have seized power in Ukraine, and threaten our borders with their radical policies. We must strike first and strike quickly if we are to destroy this Syndicalist menace. The Cossacks may be amenable to a temporary alliance..."
POL_skewer_ukraine_desc:0 "Ukraine must be destroyed, and destroyed immediately. Our claims to the entire region are weak, but enough to justify a war, if we so wish."

POL_new_communes_desc:0 "We must move the nation's power out of the hands of the bourgeois and into the hands of the people. New and stronger communes will enhance the ability of the people to defend themselves against capitalist influences, and strengthen the resolve of our people."

POL_leninist_plan_desc:0 "Jakub Hanecki's sudden leadership of the Polish people will bring with it a revival of the old Leninist ideals which have been lost to the other Syndicalist powers of the world. These ideals will bring a unique strength to Poland which will empower her for years to come."

Things however did not go peaceably as Doboszynski decided to disarm the local police after Syndicalists attacked his men. It's a sign of serious problems in our country!"
poland.3.a:0 "Send the army in and arrest everyone involved in this putsch!"
poland.4.t:0 "General unrest in the countryside!"
poland.4.d:0 "Since our national exports have fallen, our economy is so weak that it cannot support production. Prices are plummeting and thousands of peasants are demanding the government do something about the economic crisis. Peasant hatred has passed onto the gentry and the authorities, policemen have reported they are having a hard time in keeping peace in the countryside."
poland.4.a:0 "Can this get any worse?"
poland.5.t:0 "Ukrainian Terror!"
poland.5.d:0 "With the incorporation of Galicia the number of Ukrainians in our country has increased greatly. The larger cities of Eastern Galicia are populated by a majority of Poles, but the countryside the opposite is true and there are a majority of Ukrainians. Disenfranchised Ukrainians who are very unhappy about being part of Poland and have set up an organisation called the 'Ukrainian Insurgent Army' that is starting to attack our military and government officials."

poland.14.a:0 "Ask for Germany's help."
poland.14.b:0 "Let the Poles have their election."
poland.15.t:0 "Lithuania has Asked for Help"
poland.15.d:0 "The Lithuanians are asking we help them recreate the Commonwealth. Supporting them would create both a strong ally and keep Poland out of the Hapsburg's hands.

Constant distractions, debates, and general inefficiencies have prevented the Council from doing anything of note for far too long, and have led Poland down a path of constant instability.

poland.138.t:0 "The Return of Krakow"
poland.138.d:0 "While not outright denying our claims to Galicia, Austria has instead proposed that we take dominion only over the Polish-majority region of Krakow, and leave the rest to the current administrators.

poland.143.d:0 "After the election of [POL.GetLeader], Poland has been drifting ever closer into our sphere of influence. As a result of this close relationship, Poland is now seeking to acquire the territory of Plotzk from us, which has a large Polish majority. In exchange, Poland will renounce any and all claims they hold to other Polish-majority regions we control. If we were to agree, it would cement a strong relationship with Poland. However, for us to cede any territory would certainly be seen as a sign of weakness..."

poland.143.b:0 "Us? Surrendering territory? Unthinkable!"
poland.144.t:0 "The Kaiser Agrees"

Polish fortunes turned in 1916, though, with the Act of November 5th, where it was granted autonomy from the collapsing Russia. However, this triumph came with a bitter taste, as the election of a polish king was postponed again and again between 1921 and 1936 as Austria-Hungary and Germany squabbled about the nationality of a possible king and the exact status of a polish kingdom. Hence, the regency of Janusz Radziwill continues. However, all hope of a polish kingdom is not over: the Ausgleich of 1937 is eagerly looked forward to in Warsaw as the time when the future of Poland is decided. However, certain forces in Warsaw are tired of being under the Austro-German yoke, and looks towards their 'enslaved' brothers in Germany, Austria and the eastern states, hoping to one day create a kingdom for all Poles."

If we guarantee their roles in [POL.GetLeader]'s government and take an oath that the monarchy will be restored in due time, they will give their full support to the current government of Poland. It is a promising offer, but how much can we really trust these men?"
poland.197.a:0 "We will make the deal."
poland.197.b:0 "They have no real power, begone!"
poland.202.t:0 "Poland Joins the Fourth International?"
poland.202.d:0 "After their recent Syndicalist revolution, the small nation of Poland is seeking to join the ranks of true Syndicalism worldwide, the Fourth International. Should we allow them into our ranks?"
poland.202.a:0 "Our brothers!"
poland.202.b:0 "Their belief in our cause is flimsy."
poland.203.t:0 "The International Grows!"
poland.203.d:0 "The Soviet Union has accepted our entry to the Fourth International! We stand firm with our brothers in Syndicalism!"
poland.203.a:0 "The wheels of revolution turn!"
poland.204.t:0 "The Soviet Union Dismisses Polish Interest"
poland.204.d:0 "Seemingly distrusting the new Syndicalist regime in Poland, the Soviet Union has denied our entry into the Fourth International, stating that our belief in their ideals is too weak. Without the help of the Fourth International, our future in Europe looks bleak."
poland.204.a:0 "Impossible!"
poland.205.t:0 "Monarchist Coup"
poland.205.d:0 "Late last evening, gunfire erupted from many different government offices around Warsaw. In the chaos, a statement was broadcast from within the centre of the city, declaring the restoration of the Kingdom of Poland, and the downfall of the current regime. There has been a deafening silence in opposition to this message, indicating a complete victory for the monarchist faction. [POL.GetLeader] has not been seen nor heard from since the coup began, and the monarchists have already placed Augustyn Czartoryski on the throne, cementing their victory over the opposition."
poland.205.a:0 "We should have known..."
poland.206.t:0 "Augustyn I Czartoryski Passes"
poland.206.good:0 "Surrounded by family and friends, the much-beloved King [POL.GetLeader] succumbed to a severe disease that had been plaguing him for the past year. News of the king's passing has devastated the nation, and the Polish people mourn across the country. Luckily for the nation, the king's young and only son, Ludwik, is set to ascend to the throne. His ascent at the young age of 4 will mean hard times for the political leadership for the country, but many are hopeful he will grow into the role of a proper king."
poland.206.bad:0 "Surrounded by family and friends, the much-beloved King [POL.GetLeader] succumbed to a severe disease that had been plaguing him for the past year. News of the king's passing has devastated the nation, and the Polish people mourn across the country. However, a problem now faces the nation. The king's only son, Ludwik, is too young to ascend to the throne and will be for some time. This requires that a new Regency Council will take control of the nation for the next decade while the young Ludwik matures. The Polish nation is king-less once more."
poland.206.a:0 "Not again!"
poland.206.b:0 "All hail!"
poland.207.t:0 "Intervening in Galicia"
poland.207.d:0 "With the recent crisis and civil war in the Austrian Empire, the small Galician state has presented itself as a ripe target. Austria is in no position to defend them, we have a decent claim to the region, and they have a large Polish population which would *undoubtedly* welcome our liberating soldiers with open arms. This seems to be the perfect opportunity for the new regime to flex its muscles..."
poland.207.a:0 "We are not prepared."
poland.207.b:0 "Attack!"
poland.208.t:0 "Licensing a Panzer Design"
poland.208.d:0 "The '9-tonne Polish' program has reached a point where a design must be settled on if production is to begin. There are many different nation's armour designs we may attempt to license as a base for our design, but we may only choose one of them. \n\nWhich design should we attempt to license?"
poland.208.a:0 "Let us choose the Commune's H35."
poland.208.b:0 "Let us choose the German Kätzchen."
poland.208.c:0 "Let us choose the Austrian Panzer L.20 Pfau."
poland.208.e:0 "Let us choose the Canadian Vickers LT III."
poland.208.f:0 "Let us choose the Russian T-25."
poland.208.g:0 "Let us choose the Soviet T-25."
poland.208.h:0 "Let us create our own design, instead."
poland.209.t:0 "Signing the Pacta Conventa"
poland.209.d:0 "A long-standing tradition of the old Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Pacta Conventa was a contractual agreement between the people of Poland and the newly elected king. These pacts were continuously signed by elected kings from 1573 to 1764 as a sign of good faith on the part of the monarch. This pact affirmed the king's pledges to the nation, and was written uniquely for each king to sign upon election to the Polish throne. \n\nAs a symbolic gesture of King [POL.GetLeader]'s ascension to the throne, the Sejm has written a new Pacta Conventa for the king to sign. A king has not ruled the polish people for almost 150 years, and many have come to see the king's signing of this document as the de facto beginning of Poland's new age in the modern world."
poland.209.a:0 "With this signature, a new age begins."
poland.210.t:0 "Black Monday Hits Poland"
poland.210.d:0 "The effects of Black Monday are spreading throughout the economic world, and Poland is not immune to this disaster. Although economically isolated from most of Europe due to her political situation, Poland's economy still relies heavily on German trading. \n\nNews of this economic disaster has caused a run on banks across the nation, and people are already demanding that the impotent government take action. We can only hope to survive the coming storm."
poland.210.a:0 "Let us hope our economy survives."
poland.211.t:0 "The Fate of the Royal Castle"
poland.211.d:0 "Constructed in 1598 as the seat of power for Sigismund III, the Royal Castle in Warsaw has stood as the seat of Polish Kings for hundreds of years. But now, as the country has thrown off the shackles of Monarchist oppression, the Castle sits as a blight upon the worker's paradise that is Warsaw. \n\nMany proposals have been put forth on how to deal with this eyesore, but only one can be chosen."
poland.211.a:0 "Redesign it to serve the Syndicalist government."
poland.211.b:0 "Renovate it as a museum to workers worldwide."
poland.211.c:0 "Tear it down, and put a park in its place."
poland.211.t:0 "The Fate of the Royal Castle"
poland.211.d:0 "Constructed in 1598 as the seat of power for Sigismund III, the Royal Castle in Warsaw has stood as the seat of Polish Kings for hundreds of years.

poland.211.a:0 "Redesign it to serve the Syndicalist government."
poland.212.t:0 "Monarchist Train Bombing"
poland.212.d:0 "Late last night a train arriving in Lublin was rocked by a large explosion which destroyed the railway and several train cars. While no civilians were hurt in the explosion, anti-government slogans were found painted on the side of the train, alongside messages praising the old Kingdom.\n\nLocal newspapers have already begun running stories on the "Monarchist Menace".  It seems that the Monarchist faction is growing more bold in their actions."
poland.212.a:0 "We must deal with these Monarchists."
poland.213.t:0 "Monarchist Assassination"
poland.213.d:0 "Today on his way home from a long political meeting, the local governor in Lodz was killed by a small bomb being thrown at his vehicle. The bomb killed both the governor and his driver, and caused panic throughout the city. The assailant was heard shouting pro-Monarchist slogans as he disappeared into the crowds. Local police have been unable to identify the attacker, despite a hours-long search."
poland.213.a:0 "Damn!"
poland.214.t:0 "The Monarchist Militia"
poland.214.d:0 "Rumours have been spreading of a "Monarchist Militia" being formed in the Polish countryside in opposition to the government. While no real actions have been taken against the government as of yet, the fact that this "Militia" can be neither found nor dealt with is beginning to wear on the people's faith in the state."
poland.214.a:0 "The Monarchists must be stopped!"
poland.215.t:0 "20th Anniversary of Polish Independence"
poland.215.d:0 "There is celebration around the nation today as citizens of the [POL.GetName] celebrate 20 years of independence. The Kingdom of Poland was officially created with the signing of the Act of November 5th, which forged the new Polish state from the ashes of a failing Russia."
poland.215.a:0 "Here's to twenty more years!"
poland.216.t:0 "Choosing the King"
poland.216.d:0 "For over 20 years Poland has not had a King. However, another election by the Regency Council may finally change that. Unfortunately, our status as a client state of Germany has ensured the election is anything but fair. The Regency Council chamber is filled with German "observers", and none have any doubts as to the outcome of this "election"."

poland.218.t:0 "Meddling in the Polish Election"
poland.218.d:0 "The Poles have recently made moves to elect a new king, after 20 years of regency. This election presents the perfect opportunity for us to bring the Polish into our sphere of influence. We could support Karl Albrecht von Habsburg for the new King of Poland, as his election would surely bring Poland closer to us. What should we do?"
poland.218.a:0 "Pressure the Poles to elect Karl Albrecht von Habsburg."
poland.218.b:0 "Do not interfere."
poland.219.t:0 "[POL.GetLeader]'s Inaugural Address"
poland.219.d:0 "As the first president of the new Polish Republic, [POL.GetLeader] gave a rousing inaugural speech today outside of Belvedere Palace, the building selected as the seat of the new presidency. In his speech, [POL.GetLeader] promised to unite all the Polish people together in these uncertain times, and made wide promises of reform and a movement away from the old days of the Regency Council. The speech was met with enthusiastic cheers from the crowd, who came waving Polish flags and banners of the new Republic."
poland.219.a:0 "A moving speech."
poland.220.t:0 "Raising Modlin Fortress"
poland.220.d:0 "With the recent increase in tensions, our military is reviewing old fortresses for renewed service. One of the contenders is Modlin fortress, a massive fortification on the confluence of the Narew and the Vistula near Warsaw. Constructed by Napoleon in 1806 as a key fortification in his campaign against Russia, and later used by the Russians themselves, the fortress nevertheless still commands an important strategic position in the region. \n\nShould we renovate the fortress?"
poland.220.a:0 "Raise the fortress."
poland.220.b:0 "Our efforts are better spent elsewhere."
poland.221.t:0 "Poland Joins the Vienna Circle"
poland.221.d:0 "Responding to our expansion of the Vienna Circle, our dynastic relatives in Poland have made apparent their desire to join, and have sent their own representatives to Vienna to participate."
poland.221.a:0 "They are most welcome."
poland.222.t:0 "Expansion of Polskie Radio S.A. - Raszyn"
poland.222.d:0 "Ealier today the first broadcasts could be heard throughout the nation from the newest radio station operated by Polskie Radio S.A. in Raszyn. This radio station, the strongest in Europe, had a power of 120 kilowatts and could be heard from hundreds of kilometers away. This long-range station will allow all Polish citizens nationwide to hear the news and other important information from the comfort of their own homes."
poland.222.a:0 "A fantastic achievement."
poland.223.t:0 "Expansion of Polskie Radio S.A. - Warsaw II"
poland.223.d:0 "Continuing the expansion of their national radio network, Polskie Radio S.A. has today begun broadcasting from their second permanent radio station in Warsaw, bringing their total number of stations to five.
