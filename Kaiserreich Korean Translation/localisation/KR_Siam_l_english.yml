# Mahidol Line
POLITICS_RAMA_VII_DESC:0 "Prajadhipok, also known by his regnal name, Rama VII, was enthroned as King of Siam upon the death of his brother in 1925. Unprepared for his own ascension, he's pretty much a puppet of the Siamese Council of State run by his cousins. Regardless, Prajadhipok genuinely cares for his people, and works diligently to improve his subjects’ lot." # Prajadhipok
POLITICS_RAMA_VIII_DESC:0 "Ananda Mahidol, known by his regnal name as Rama VIII, has ascended to the Siamese throne following the death of his uncle, Rama VII. Ananda Mahidol was once considered a very unlikely candidate for the throne, due to his young age and (relatively) low birth, having originally held the rank of ‘Mom Chao’, and thus among the lowest of Siamese princes. Despite his youth and inexperience, he quickly won the hearts of the Thai people. Foreign observers, however, believed that Ananda Mahidol did not really want to be king and felt his reign would not last long. " # Ananda Mahidol
POLITICS_RAMA_VIX_DESC:0 "Bhumibol Adulyadej, known by his regnal name as Rama IX has ascended to the Siamese throne following the mysterious death of his late brother, Rama VIII. Bhumibol Adulyadej has so far proven himself much more politically competent than his late brother, successfully maneuvering the convoluted Siamese political landscape with seeming ease. Many speak of Bhumibol Adulyadej as the savior of the once embattled Siamese monarchy" # Bhumibol Adulyadej
# Paribatra Line
POLITICS_SUKHUMBHAND_DESC:0 "Paribatra Sukhumbhand, cousin to expected successor to the Siamese throne, Ananda Mahidol, has seized control of the Siamese government citing Ananda's inexperienceness and his age. With the full support of the Privy Council, he had crowned himself as King Rama VIII and thus firmly established the Boripatr cadet branch as the main succession line." # Paribatra Sukhumbhand
POLITICS_CHUMBHOTBONGS_PARIBATRA_DESC:0 "Chumbhotbongs Paribatra, known by his regnal name Rama IX has succeeded his father, Rama VIII to the throne of Siam. Chumbhotbongs Paribatra is something of a recluse but still politically competent. He is a known patron of the arts, having converted multiple state-owned properties into museums, and has personally sponsored many great artists both in Siam and abroad." # Chumbhotbongs Paribatra
POLITICS_SUKHUMABHININDA_DESC:0 "Sukhumbhinanda, son of former King Paribatra Sukhumbhand, Rama VIII and a lowborn woman, was legitimised by his brother, King Chumbhotbongs Paribatra, Rama IX due to the latter’s inability to produce a male heir, asceneded to the throne as Rama X. Sukhumbhinanda is a prominent philanthropist whose efforts to relieve Bangkok’s poorest have garnered him much publicity. With Sukhumbhinanda’s ascension, much of the remaining public discontent with the Paribatra branch has dissipated."
# Chrakrabongse Line
POLITICS_CHULA_CHAKRABONGSE_DESC:0 " Chula Chakrabongse, the half-European grandson of King Rama V, has been installed as king of Siam. Chula Chakrabongse lives an eccentric life, and has delegated nearly all of duties in favor of his passions for both horse and automobile racing."
# Left
POLITICS_SONG_NOPPAKUL_DESC:0 "Song Noppakul, also known by his real name Prasong Wongwiwat and 'Comrade Ba' is a Thai-Chinese who co-founded the underground Syndicalist movement within Siam, and later its de-facto leader following the death of Pichit na Sukothai."# Song Noppakul the Totalist
POLITICS_PRIDI_PANOMYONG_DESC:0 " Pridi Phanomyong, also known by his ministerial title, Luang Praditmanutham, following his appointment in the Office of the Council of State, immediately set out to better the lives of the Siamese people. His controversial ‘Yellow Cover Dossier’, outlining his political and economic reform agenda, divided the Siamese government, but the controversy only served to further Pridi’s political career." # Pridi Phanomyong at the onset of the CW
POLITICS_PRIDI_PANOMYONG_REBEL_WIN_DESC:0 "Pridi Phanmoyong, previously known by his ministerial title, Luang Praditmanutham, has become the Chairman of the Sapha Prachachon following a brief but bloodly Siamese Civil War. Panomyong’s policies of economic nationalisation and radical parliamentarian reform may now continue unhindered. However, challenges from more radical elements within Pridi’s Sahachip Party have grown signifigantly, and despite his popularity, Panomyong struggles to maintain his authority even with his allies in the Navy." # Pridi Phanomyong after winning his rebellion
# Right
POLITICS_PLAEK_KHITTASANGKHA_DESC:0 "Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram, or as more popular known as 'Chormpon Por' by the Thais and 'Phibun' in the West, once an ally of Pridi Panomyong and member of the Khana Ratsadon, has seized power along with his allies in the Siamese military following the Yellow Cover Dossier Affair. Together with Luang Wichitwathakarn, he built his own Leadership Cult to marginalised the Monarchy's influence. He himself view Siam as an 'outdate relic of a bygone era' and will use his power to promote Militarism and Nationalism which he proclaimed as essential to the survival of the nation." # Plaek Phibunsongkhram after Coup d'etat
POLITICS_PHAO_SRIYANOND_DESC:0 "Police General Phao Sriyanond has succeeded Plaek Phibunsongkhram as leader of Siam’s military regime with the support of the Soi Ratchakhru Clique. Phao is known for his brutality and political cunning, and his political opponents have a tendency to ‘disappear’. Phao also believes the Siamese monarchy to be an antiquated relic which impairs the cause of nationalism, and is thus an avowed Republican" # Phao Sriyanond
POLITICS_SARIT_THANARAT_DESC:0 "General Sarit Thanarat has succeeded Plaek Phibunsongkhram as leader of Siam’s military regime with the support of the Sisao Thawaet Clique. Originally a lowly officer in the Phayap Army, he quickly rose through the ranks with Plaek and Phin's help. A known ardent anti-Syndicalist, he viewed the Monarchy as an important tool against the reds and as the essence of Thai Nationalism." # Sarit Thanarat

## Introduction Events ##
siamn.1.t:0 "1936년의 시암 왕국"
siamn.1.d:0 "As one of the countries that had benefited from the German victory during the Weltkrieg, Siam had regained most of its former land which had previously been lost to the Western imperialists during the years of 1919 and 1925 respectively under the name of a former 'Central Powers' member. While its relationship with the Teutons is cordial in general, the fact that they thwarted [SIA.GetAdjective] expansionist ambitions during the 1929 Intervention in Burma has strained diplomatic and military ties between the two. Should Siam reconcile with the Germans or align itself with others powers is completely up to you."
siamn.1.a:0 "Interesting, tell me more!"
siamn.1.b:0 "I've a good grasp of the general situation."

siamn.2.t:0 "시암 왕국의 정부와 정치"
siamn.2.d:0 "Ever since the coronation of King Rama VII in 1925 most, if not all, of the policies set forth by Siam have been dictated by the Aphiratthamontri Sapha (Council of State) which is a council made up of the King's older siblings who have continually worked for consolidating power as the grip of the King over the nation is weak. Despite promising the [SIA.GetAdjective] intelligentsia a constitutional monarchy through the reformation of the constitution, reform in general has been tough to pass as it harms the interests of the nobility.\n\nSurrounded by enemies, such as the the Konbaung dynasty to the west, Yunnanese bandits to the north, and the German imperialists to the east, Siam is in a dire situation. It will either perish, forever confined to the pages of a history book, or shall reform itself and emerge a modern state, be it by negotiation or through the use of force."
siamn.2.a:0 "그를 불쌍히 여기라"

siamn.3.t:0 "시암 왕국의 전반적인 상황"
siamn.3.d:0 "While seemingly economically and industrially prosperous to many, Siam is actually very reliant on investments made by Germany and cherishes the economic ties it shares with the nation. Its industry in general is very fragile as rice, sugar, and timber are its main exports. In addition, nationalism among ethnic minorities has been rising which has concerned many as this has brought forth the potential of separatist movements in the near future. On top of all this, however, the bloated bureaucratic system, which has been present since the reign of Rama VI, has siphoned off much needed taxes which has allowed for bandits to continually run wild in the fringes of Siam."

SIA_prajadhipokreform_desc:0 "With the ongoing economic crisis, perhaps it would be best for us to begin to enact new reforms as the old guard and nobility within our nation will not have the chance to oppose our initiatives... or will they?"
SIA_ratthasapha_desc:0 "To aid with the continual modernisation of Siam, we must begin to reform the inefficient bureaucracy that was formed during the days when the monarchy ruled with an iron fist. The Anantasamakhom Throne Hall has been deemed a suitable location for the new Ratthasapha (parliament) building and will allow more people to participate in the development of Siam."
SIA_khana_ratsadon_desc:0 "While Prajadhipok's plan seems ideal, its implementation is occurring at a slow pace. With such great inequality within Siamese society, alongside nepotism within the bureaucracy and the ongoing economic crisis, the Khana Ratsadon (People's Party) must take up the mantle of reform and remove the greatest obstacle to reform, the Siamese Council of State, from power!"
SIA_yellowcoverdossier_desc:0 "Luang Praditmanutham (Pridi Panomyong) has proposed a socialist constitution aiming to resolve the inequality problem within Siamese society which has enjoyed popular support from the peasants. The nobility have, of course, objected to this plan. Perhaps a deal with the devil can guarantee the safety of our own nation from the syndicalist menace?"
SIA_statewelfare_desc:0 "By providing welfare to our citizens through the use of state funds, we can ensure that all of the Siamese people will receive access to proper medical care, education, and other types of government support. This will, however, come with the trade off of high taxes which will alienate and turn the capitalists against us."
SIA_halfleafdemocracy_desc:0 "The strong guiding hand of the monarch over the nation may be required in order to better deal with and counter the ever approaching waves of the syndicalist tide properly. By granting more power to the King and allowing him to appoint the Prime Minister, alongside immunity from persecution through the law, we can guarantee stability in the long run. This will, however, dissatisfy the liberals."
SIA_prestigious_senate_desc:0 "The Wutthisapha (Senate), which bares a close resemblance to the British House of Lords, has been introduced with the intention of allowing the King to appoint loyal and experienced advisers in order to halt the passage of some of the more radical bills proposed by elements within the government."
SIA_privycouncilreforms_desc:0 "With the Siamese Council of States possessing the ability to dictate the King's policies from behind-the-scenes, perhaps we should look into reforming the old Privy Council? That way, we can hire like-minded advisers and better compete with the council for influence, thereby becoming the main driving force behind our nation."
SIA_empowerthenobility_desc:0 "By modernising the current, and outdated, nobility system into one that is based off of the ideals of meritocracy, as opposed to simply abolishing it, we may be able to achieve our dream of bringing about a more efficient bureaucratic system."
SIA_fathergovernschildren_desc:0 "We can harken back to the days of the Sukothai era, during the reign of the benevolent King Ramkamhaeng the Great, by allowing our subjects to voice their issues directly to the Privy Council. This will have the added bonus of assisting with the resolution of several issues in a much more efficient manner."
SIA_tourthenation_desc:0 "In order to better learn about our subjects and the problems they face, in addition to increasing their trust in the monarchy, the King shall personally tour the nation."
SIA_royalprojectfoundation_desc:0 "To better and more efficiently tackle problems within our nation, while also keeping track of current issues plaguing the day to day lives of citizens and the government, a commission, which shall be called the Royal Project Foundation, must be created."
SIA_adevotedmonarchy_desc:0 "By working closely with our subjects in terms of further agrarian and general development of the nation, we've managed to gain the support of those living in rural areas. This will serve as a deterrent against the scarlet phantom known as the syndicalist threat."
SIA_nationwidelandreform_desc:0 "Land owned by the nobility, that has been left unused for one reason or another, remains across the country, serving no purpose. Redistributing these lands to the poor and landless farmers will be an economic boon as this will help generate more economic activity while also raising overall productivity. This will, however, provoke landowners."
SIA_fiveyearplan_desc:0 "By encouraging the development of rural areas through the promotion of the building of infrastructure and undertaking industrial development programmes, we can safely say that we are well on the road to become a Siwilai (civilised) nation ourselves."
SIA_aliberalsiam_desc:0 "Savaeng Piampongsarn, a graduate from Rayong who had studied law, is currently the leader of the liberal/progressive faction within the Ratthasapha.

SIA_landsofthefree_desc:0 "Upon emerging victorious following the election, one of Piampongsarn's first initiatives is to enact a policy that will promote equal rights within the nation and see the empowerment of the Laotian, Mon people, Malays, Chinese, and Cambodians, alongside the native Siamese people."
SIA_newsiamsociety_desc:0 "Additional classes, regarding the civic duties of each citizen, have been added to the national curriculum and are now compulsory, ensuring that every citizen can fully and equally participate in Piampongsarn's envisioned democratic society."
SIA_progressivemeasures_desc:0 "The progressives have enacted measures which give women the right to vote alongside granting them equal pay on par with their male counterparts. In addition, the regulation of monopolies and corporations through the use of anti-trust laws have also been implemented in order to promote equal competition in favour of the legitimate competitor."
SIA_modernsiamesenation_desc:0 "Our nation has progressed rather far from what it once was. We are no longer a nineteenth century backwater but are, in fact, a modernised nation who is at the forefront of progress. Of course, this does not mean we shall stop here as we will continually strive to better ourselves and the nation. Long live our great nation!"
SIA_iron_marshal_desc:0 "Luang Phibunsongkhram, who had gained his initial fame during the Siamese intervention in Burma, now faces the monumental task of keeping the nation together and safe from the royalist/parliamentarian threat."
SIA_nationalizationofforeignindustries_desc:0 "Siam will need all of the power she can realistically amass in order to stand up on her own in this ever turbulent world. We will either purchase all foreign factories within our nation or, if left with no other choice, seize them by force. These factories shall be nationalised and used to help further our industrialisation programme."
SIA_yuwachontaharn_desc:0 "The Yuwachon Taharn (Youth Militia) is a reserve officer cadet training programme which aims to better the combat performance of new recruits. By ensuring that every able-bodied men understands how to properly wield and use a rifle, we can better increase the quality of our army."
SIA_ratthaniyomdecrees_desc:0 "Thaification policies have already begun to take effect. Thai script is now standardised for usage, Betel chewing has been banned, the central Thai language is being enforced in schools nationwide, and Chinese/Muslim schools who have not been compliant with our demands have been shut down. In addition, the new national anthem is being promoted to further the new Thai identity."
SIA_reapporachthemonarchy_desc:0 "Following the assassination of Luang Phibunsongkhram, Sarit Thanarat had managed to take control over both the armed forces and the government in rapid succession. In order to move towards his idea of Patiwat (revolution) and institute the guiding principle of Phokhun, Thanarat had viewed reconciliation with the Chakri dynasty as essential as the monarchy must serve the role of moral guidance."
SIA_buddhisttraditions_desc:0 "We shall begin the promotion of Theravada Buddhism as the national religion in order to further national unity under a single Supreme Patriarch for both the Mahanikai and Thammayutthanikai sects alongside the minority of Mahayana Buddhists within the nation. This will, however, dissatisfy the Muslims who reside in the south."
SIA_creationoftherepublic_desc:0 "ollowing the assassination of Luang Phibunsongkhram, Phao Sriyanond had managed to take control over both the armed forces and the government in rapid succession. Viewing the monarchy as an archaic relic, and disliking the status of the monarchy during Phibunsongkhram's tenure, Sriyanond believes that the old system should be overhauled in favour of republicanism."
SIA_survivorofthecivilwar_desc:0 "One of the most devastating wars in Siamese history, which had taken a heavy toll on the nation itself–surpassing even the Burmese invasion of Ayutthaya in 1765, it is clear that we must do all that we can to learn from this mess and further ourselves as a nation."
SIA_reconstruction_desc:0 "We must begin to undertake a broad and sweeping construction programme in order to restore not only the nation itself, but the spirit of our people as well. We must honour the sacrifices made by our allies and all of those who had rallied behind us during our darkest hour."
SIA_amnesty_desc:0 "A lesson the civil war has taught us was that we require the help of every capable hand in order to help guide the nation through this period of calamity and, so, we have decided to grant amnesty to the officers who had fought against us. While this may result in some unrest from the populace, it is clear that these traitorous officers continue to remain important to us and, thus, their assistance is necessary."
SIA_the_great_purge_desc:0 "A lesson the civil war has taught us was that we need to ensure that all traitors are dealt with swiftly and mercilessly in order to promote stability within the nation and, thus, we shall rid ourselves of all of the officers who had fought against us. While this will most certainly negatively affect High Command, executing them will help us better consolidate power in the long run."
SIA_military_royalty_desc:0 "In order to avoid the possibility of a rebellious military, we must ensure that the surviving officers and soldiers are loyal to both the government and the people, not outsiders who will help fulfil hidden agendas."
SIA_people_assembly_desc:0 "We shall free ourselves from the chains of the archaic feudal system that, somehow, continues to persist into the twentieth century. A government, heavily taking inspiration from the Commune of France, shall be established in order to fulfil the goal of the Congress for the Proletariats."
SIA_faith_in_the_star_desc:0 "To ensure that our revolution truly bears fruit, we must spread our doctrine to the masses and bring them the hope and assurance of a brighter future ahead, with the red star shining bright and helping guide them through these gloomy times."
SIA_new_order_rise_desc:0 "The Krating Daeng (Red Guars) Paramilitary Group has been created by the government in order to counter the remaining opposition, mostly made up of capitalists and former nobles, who wish to ensure the preservation of the status-quo. By ridding ourselves of them, we can begin the transition to more peaceful days."
SIA_arunothai_desc:0 "In order to ensure the protection of the new system, we must sacrifice everything within our power until we have nothing left but our blood, toil, tears, and sweat. The red dawn shall ensure both warmth and unity, destroying any capitalists who dare try and destabilise our glorious nation!"

SIA_centralizedpolicecommand_desc:0 "Following the Weltkrieg, our police command has become paralysed as it is comprised of a mix of German, Italian, and American employees.

SIA_regionaluniversities:0 "Creation of Regional Universities"
SIA_regionaluniversities_desc:0 "In order to support the progression of our nation, we must first create a strong foundation to help provide a good base.
