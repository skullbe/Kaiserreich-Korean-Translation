# Introduction Events
siamn.1.t:0 "Kingdom of Siam in 1936"
siamn.1.d:0 "As one of the countries benefit from the German Victory during the Weltkrieg - Siam regained most of its former land lost to the Western imperialists in 1919 and 1925 respectively in the name of former 'Central Powers' member. While its relationship with the Teutons looks pretty cordial in general - the fact that they thwarted the Siamese expansionist ambition during the 1929 Intervention in Burma strained the ties between the two. Should Siam rebuild the bridge with the Germans or re-aligning itself with other powers is up to you."
siamn.1.a:0 "Interesting, tell me more!"
siamn.1.b:0 "I've already grasp the general situation - No thanks."

siamn.2.t:0 "The Kingdom's State of Politics"
siamn.2.d:0 "Ever since the coronation of King Rama VII in 1925 - most if not all of the policies are dictated by the Aphiratthamontri Sapha (Council of State) made up of the king's older siblings who worked for the nation since Rama V era as he lack the strong grip on the reign. Even though he had promised the Siamese Foreign-graduated Intelligentsia who demand a Constitution Monarchy, even a reform in general is hard to pass if it harmed the nobility's interests./nSurrounded by the eternal enemy Konbaung dynasty to the West, Yunnan bandits to the north and the German Imperialists on the other side. Siam is currently in a dire situation - it will either perished or reform itself to a modern state, be it by talks or by forces."
siamn.2.a:0 "Pity on him"

siamn.3.t:0 "The Kingdom's Overall Situation"
siamn.3.d:0 "While looking quite prosperous from the inside - Siam is pretty reliant on the German investments and economy. Its industry in general are pretty fragile with products such as Rice, Sugar and Timber being the main exports. The nationalism among ethnic minorities are also on the rise which might results in troublesome separatist movement in the future. The inflated Bureaucratic system from Rama VI era siphoned-off the much needed taxes while bandits still run wild in the fringe areas."
siamn.3.a:0 "I'd rather pick the Philippines"

# Black Monday and Early political chaos; Max Reform 7 - Lowest 0: 0-2 = Khana Ratsadon coup, 3-4 = Civil War with Prajadhipok Bias (based on Boworadet Rebellion), 5-6 = success, 7 = Reactionary coup with Paribatra as HoS
siamn.4.t:0 "Black Monday hits Siam!"
siamn.4.d:0 "Being heavily reliant on the German economy - the Black Monday quickly drag Siam into an abyss as all main agricultural exports began to wither in their warehouses and granary and clerks working for foreign companies being layoff. People are starting to gather around the Grand Palace - maybe we should do something before the situation falters."
siamn.4.a:0 "Khun Prah!"

siamn.5.t:0 "Jasmine Rice Problems"
siamn.5.d:0 "Being one of the Siamese largest export sector - the farmer across the Chao Phraya plateau need government help to deal with the excessive number of rice available in the market as export number flops."

siamn.6.t:0 "Bloated Bureaucracy"
siamn.6.d:0 "The modern Bureaucratic system was formed during Rama V's era and greatly expanded during Rama VI's reign. However - it's proved to be too large and ineffective but firing any more people would means more people who suffer from 'voluntary retirement'."
siamn.6.a:0 "Layoff Lower Clerks" # 0 reform
siamn.6.b:0 "Layoff Managers and Ministers" #-100, +1 reform
siamn.6.c:0 "Keep the Status Quo for now" #-200, +2 reform

siamn.7.t:0 "Military Expenditures"
siamn.7.d:0 "Being surrounded by both enemy and the imperialist from all sides - Siam spent up to 30% of her annual revenue to keep up with the Arm Race. In this hard time maybe cutting some procurement budget wouldn't hurt us that much"

siamn.7.b:0 "Anything but the new rifle development" #-10 for 3 years, +1 reform
siamn.7.c:0 "We shouldn't let our weakness be exposed to the enemy!" #-200, +2 reform

siamn.8.t:0 "Emergency Tax"
siamn.8.d:0 "Even though lots of reform are already enacted - we still don't have enough money for this year's expense. An emergency tax should help but that would surely create more suffering for our loyal subjects."

siamn.8.b:0 "Double the Inheritance tax" #+10, +1 reform
siamn.8.c:0 "Lift the ban on Gambling" #+30, -5 NP, +1 reform

# Khana Ratsadon Path - Pre-Election
siamn.10.t:0 "Khana Ratsadon Provisional Cabinet"
siamn.10.d:0 "After the bloodless revolution, it's now our job to rebuild our country from the ground up. Luang Praditmanutham - head of the civilian faction of the provisional government and a prominent leftist is now creating a more 'Formal' constitution while others are educating the masses about how parliamentary democracy works while Phraya Phahonponpayuhasena readied his troops in-case of opportunistic foreign invasion for now."
siamn.10.a:0 "A great leap forward for us all"

# Prajadhipok's Reform Path - Pre-Election
siamn.11.t:0 "Khanagummakarn Ratsadon Provisional Cabinet"
siamn.11.d:0 "After the constitution is signed - The People's Committee chosen by Prajadhipok's himself is now working on educating the masses about how proper parliamentary democracy works.\n\nHeaded by Phraya Manopakorn Nitithada - a compromise between the Reformist and Traditionalist faction in the Siamese Court, the Committee is also responsible for other reforms from Educational, Health and the Industrialisation programme. Even though the path ahead isn't a bed of roses - a bright future is awaiting us for sure."

SIA_ratthasapha_desc:0 "To modernise Siam further - there must be some bureaucratic refrom from the old inefficient Absolute Monarchy. The Anantasamakhom Throne Hall is deemed suitable as a place for the new Ratthasapha (Parliament) building, to allow more people to participate in this nation's development."
SIA_khana_ratsadon_desc:0 "While Prajadhipok's plan seems nice - they are being implemented at much a slower pace due to the intervention of those who feel that their own interests are being harmed. With those inequalities in the Siamese society, Nepotism among the bureaucrat and the new economic crisis. Khana Ratsadon (People's Party) shall lead the change by removing the biggest obstacle known as the 'Siamese Council of State' from power!"
SIA_yellowcoverdossier_desc:0 "Luang Praditmanutham (Pridi Panomyong) had propose a socialist constitution aiming to dealt with the inequality problem within our society such as new land reforms to provide landless farmers with their own land and welfare state. While it did enjoy quite a popular support from the peasants, the old nobility of course object this plan. Maybe dealing with the devils can guarantee safety of our own nation from the Syndicalist threat?"
SIA_statewelfare:0 "State-Provided Welfare"
SIA_halfleafdemocracy_desc:0 "A firm, strong grip of the Monarch to dictate the direction of our country might be needed to counter the waves of Syndicalist threat properly. By granting the king more power such as appointing his own Prime Minister, immunity from persecution by law and others, we might be loosing poppular support from the liberals but that will guarantee stability in the long run."
SIA_prestigious_senate_desc:0 "Wutthisapha (Senate) is created to mimic the British House of Lords in mind. By allowing the King to pick those who're both royal and experienced himself, we can probably prevent some of those too radical bills to pass."
SIA_privycouncilreforms_desc:0 "With the Siamese Council of States dictating the king's policies from the shadows for a long time - reforming the old Privy Council with like-minded advisers might be able to compete in influence with them and become the main driving force for our nation eventually."
SIA_empowerthenobility_desc:0 "Maybe by modernising the old nobility system into the one based on Meritocracy as opposed to abolish it - Efficient bureaucratic system might be achievable this way too. "
SIA_fathergovernschildren_desc:0 "By allowing our subjects to voiced their own problem directly to the Privy Council like the Benevolent King Ramkamhaeng the Great of the Sukothai era. Several issues could be solved at a much faster pace."
SIA_tourthenation_desc:0 "To know the problem our subjects experienced personally - the King must visit those place personally which also served as a way to increase their trust in the Monarchy."
SIA_royalprojectfoundation_desc:0 "To tackle with those problems efficiently - a commission needed to be made to find the best solution for those problems and keeping track of those projects."
SIA_adevotedmonarchy_desc:0 "By working closely with our subjects in developing the nation - we've gain staunch support from the rural areas which also served as a deterrent to the scarlet phantom known as Syndicalist threat."
SIA_nationwidelandreform_desc:0 "There are lots of lands across the country which is own by the nobility but left abandoned due to whatever reasons - by distributing them to the poor landless rice farmers, much more productivity can be gained from those lands but that'll surely provoked some landlords. "
SIA_fiveyearplan_desc:0 "By encouraging the development of the rural areas by promoting infrastructure and industrial development - we're well on the road to join the Siwilai (Civilised) countries list like Japan and South America."
