siamn.1.t:0 "1936년의 시암 왕국"
siamn.1.d:0 "As one of the countries that benefited from the German Victory during the Weltkrieg - Siam regained most of its former land lost to the Western imperialists in 1919 and 1925 respectively in the name of a former 'Central Powers' member. While its relationship with the Teutons looks pretty cordial in general - the fact that they thwarted the [SIA.GetAdjective] expansionist ambitions during the 1929 Intervention in Burma strained the ties between the two. Should Siam rebuild the bridge with the Germans or re-align itself with other powers is up to you."

Even though he had promised the [SIA.GetAdjective] Foreign-graduated Intelligentsia who demand a Constitution Monarchy, even a reform in general is hard to pass if it harmed the nobility's interests.\n\nSurrounded by the eternal enemy of the Konbaung dynasty to the West, Yunnan bandits to the north and the German Imperialists to the east. Siam is currently in a dire situation - it will either perish or reform itself to a modern state, be it by negotiation or by force."

siamn.3.t:0 "시암 왕국의 전반적인 상황"
siamn.3.d:0 "While looking quite prosperous from the inside - Siam is pretty reliant on investments and trade ties with Germany. Its industry in general is pretty fragile with products such as rice, sugar and timber being the main exports. The nationalism among ethnic minorities is also on the rise which might result in troublesome separatist movements in the future. The inflated Bureaucratic system from the Rama VI era siphoned off much needed taxes while bandits still run wild in the fringe areas."

SIA_prajadhipokreform_desc:0 "With the new economic crisis going on - maybe this is the best chance for us to enact new reforms as the old guard nobility won't voice much opposition... or will they?"
SIA_ratthasapha_desc:0 "To modernise Siam further - there must be some bureaucratic refrom from the old inefficient Absolute Monarchy. The Anantasamakhom Throne Hall is deemed suitable as a place for the new Ratthasapha (Parliament) building, to allow more people to participate in this nation's development."
SIA_khana_ratsadon_desc:0 "While Prajadhipok's plan seems nice - it is being implemented at much a slower pace due to the intervention of those who feel that their own interests are being harmed. With such inequality in the Siamese society, nepotism among the bureaucracy and the new economic crisis, Khana Ratsadon (People's Party) shall lead the change by removing the biggest obstacle known as the 'Siamese Council of State' from power!"
SIA_yellowcoverdossier_desc:0 "Luang Praditmanutham (Pridi Panomyong) had propose a socialist constitution aiming to deal with the inequality problem within our society. While it did enjoy popular support from the peasants, the old nobility, of course, object this plan. Maybe dealing with the devils can guarantee safety of our own nation from the Syndicalist threat?"
SIA_statewelfare_desc:0 "State-provided welfare will surely help to make sure that everyone will get access to proper medical care, education, and other government support - but this will of course come with high tax that might alienated the capitalists."
SIA_halfleafdemocracy_desc:0 "A firm, strong grip of the Monarch to dictate the direction of our country might be needed to counter the waves of the Syndicalist threat properly. By granting the king more power such as appointing his own Prime Minister, immunity from persecution by law and others, we might be loosing popular support from the liberals but that will guarantee stability in the long run."
SIA_prestigious_senate_desc:0 "Wutthisapha (Senate) was created to mimic the British House of Lords. By allowing the King to pick those who're both loyal and experienced, we can probably prevent some of the more radical bills from passing."
SIA_privycouncilreforms_desc:0 "With the Siamese Council of States dictating the king's policies from the shadows for a long time - reforming the old Privy Council with like-minded advisers might be able to compete in influence with them and become the main driving force for our nation."
SIA_empowerthenobility_desc:0 "Maybe by modernising the old nobility system into the one based on Meritocracy as opposed to just abolishing it an efficient bureaucratic system might be achievable. "
SIA_fathergovernschildren_desc:0 "By allowing our subjects to voice their issues directly to the Privy Council it will be just like the Benevolent King Ramkamhaeng the Great of the Sukothai era. Several issues could be resolved, and much faster as well."
SIA_tourthenation_desc:0 "To know the problems our subjects experience first hand - the King must visit those places personally which also serves as a way to increase the common man's their trust in the Monarchy."
SIA_royalprojectfoundation_desc:0 "To tackle those problems efficiently a commission needed to be made to find the best solution for those issues and keeping track of those projects."
SIA_adevotedmonarchy_desc:0 "By working closely with our subjects in developing the nation - we've gain staunch support from the rural areas which also serves as a deterrent to the scarlet phantom known as the Syndicalist threat."
SIA_nationwidelandreform_desc:0 "There are lots of lands across the country which are owned by the nobility but left abandoned due to random reasons - by distributing them to the poor landless rice farmers, much more productivity will be gained from those lands. However this will provoke some landlords at the same time."
SIA_fiveyearplan_desc:0 "Encouraging the development of rural areas by promoting infrastructure and industrial development - we're well on the road to join the Siwilai (Civilised) countries list like Japan and those of South America."
SIA_aliberalsiam_desc:0 "Savaeng Piampongsarn, a law graduate from Rayong is currently leading the Liberal and Progressive faction within the Ratthasapha. Inspired partly by the Japanese-style Democracy of the Taisho era, he promised to deliver the masses peace and prosperity."
SIA_landsofthefree_desc:0 "Upon winning the election - one of his first policy is to promote equal rights within the nation, no matter what ethnicities they are be it Siamese, Laos, Mon, Malays, Chinese or Cambodians. Local autonomy are also granted to facilitate democratisation effort based on the already existing Sukhapibarn scheme."

SIA_progressivemeasures_desc:0 "By making sure that woman receives the same salary as men and the right to vote. The regulation of monopolies (Trust Busting) and corporations through antitrust laws were also implemented to promote equal competition for the advantage of legitimate competitor."
SIA_modernsiamesenation_desc:0 "Our nation has progressed quite far from a backwater country in the 19th Century to a modern institution of the 20th Century who's at the forefront of progress. We shall not stop here but continue to strive for the better!"
SIA_iron_marshal_desc:0 "Luang Phibunsongkhram who gained his initial fame during the Siamese intervention in Burma is now facing an important task to keep the nation together from the Royalist-Parliamentarian War. Perhaps it's his destined goal after all of taking the reign of the nation himself and making sure that it go down the correct path."
SIA_nationalizationofforeignindustries_desc:0 "Siam need all power to make sure that she can stand up on her own in this harsh world. All of the foreign factories will be bought from the original or if not comply - seized it by force and nationalised as a basis for our own Industrialisation programme."
SIA_yuwachontaharn_desc:0 "Yuwachon Taharn (Youth Miitia) is a reserve officer cadet training programme aiming at increasing combat performance for new recruits. By making sure that every able men at least know how to wield rifle and use them, this will benefit us later in the long run."
SIA_ratthaniyomdecrees_desc:0 "Thaification policies aiming to bring the nation together under the Majority Thai rule. Standard Thai script, banning of the Betel chewing, enforcing Central Tha language in schools nationwide while closing down Chinese and Muslim schools if they didn't comply with the general guideline. New 'Thai' identities such as new national anthem and others are also promoted." 
SIA_reapporachthemonarchy_desc:0 "After the Assassination of Luang Phibunsongkhram - Sarit Thanarat managed to take control over both the Armed Forces and the Government in a quick succession. He viewed the reapproachment with the Chakri dynasty was essential in the move toward his idea of 'Patiwat'(Revolution) and the guiding leadership principle of 'Phokhun' while the Monarchy serve as a moral guidance for the whole nation."
SIA_buddhisttraditions_desc:0 "While we can promote Theravada Buddhism to the National Religion status for some extra National Unity under a single Supreme Patriach for both Mahanikai and Thammayutthanikai sects as well as the minority of Mahayana Buddhism in our country - this won't bold well with the Muslims who resides in the South."
SIA_creationoftherepublic_desc:0 "After the Assassination of Luang Phibunsongkhram - Phao Sriyanond managed to take control over both the Armed Forces and the Government in a quick succession. He viewed the idea of Monarchy as the relics of the old era and the Limbo status of the Monarchy during Phibunsongkhram's tenure as a bad thing. Siam should've done away with the old system altogether and fully embrace Republicanism."
SIA_survivorofthecivilwar_desc:0 "One of the most devastated war on the Siamese homeland beyond the level of 1765 Burmese Invasion of Ayutthaya. While we do suffered badly from the conflict - there's at least some lessons we can learn from this mess."

SIA_amnesty_desc:0 "What we learned from the Civil War is that we need every capable hand to guide us through this period of calamity. While this might result in some unrest from the general populace, these traitorous officers are still important to us and thus needed."
SIA_the_great_purge_desc:0 "What we learned from the Civil War is that we'll need to purged every thorn on our side to bring back stability to our nation. While this might affected our Military High Command structure negatively - excuting them will surely help us in the long run as we cemented our powerbase."
SIA_military_royalty_desc:0 "To avoid the same mistake - the surviving military command should be loyal to the government and serve their own people, not others who helped to fulfil their own objectives."
SIA_people_assembly_desc:0 "We shall free ourselves from the chains of old feudal system that somehow still persist in this 20th Century. A government based on the Commune of France shall be established here to fulfil our 'Congress for the Proletariats' goal."

SIA_arunothai_desc:0 "To protect our new Syndicalist nation - every sacrifice must be made whether if it's bloods, toil or tears! The 'Red Dawn' shall give us warmth and burned those filthy Capitalists to Death before they ever dare step into our country!"

### Government Reform Path ###

SIA_juridicialreform_desc:0 "While the archaic Ayutthayan era law was long gone by now, gaining back extraterritorial jurisdiction rights we lost to the Bowring treaty and other similar ones we make with the Europeans must be done to regain our prestige back.
