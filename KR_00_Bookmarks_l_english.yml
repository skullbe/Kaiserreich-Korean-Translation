KR_SCENARIO_NAME:0 "세계대전의 유산"
KR_SCENARIO_DESC:0 "1936년은 세계사의 전환점이 될 것입니다. 거대한 기회인 동시에 위협이 다가오는 때입니다. 독일 제국과 프랑스 코뮌 사이의 긴장감이 거세지고 있습니다. 러시아와 미합중국은 내분의 조짐이 나타나고 있으며 쇠락한 제국 오스트리아와 오스만은 쇠퇴하고 있습니다. 한편 생디칼리슴, 전체주의 그리고 급진사회주의는 전세계에 뿌리내리고 있습니다. 세계대전 종전 후 15년, 옛 적국들이 다시 고개를 들고 있습니다. 단 하나의 불씨만으로도 이 화약고는 폭발하게 될 것입니다..."

### Germany ###
GER_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "1919년, 5년의 전쟁 끝에 독일군은 프랑스에서 협상국의 방어선을 무너뜨렸습니다. 그리고 1921년, 영국의 항복이 뒤따랐습니다. 세계대전은 독일을 유일무이한 강대국으로 만들어 주었지만, 1930년대 이후로 독일은 내리막길을 걷고 있습니다. 후퇴하는 세계 경제로 인해 독일의 산업력이 약화된 반면 다른 국가들의 제조업은 회복되었고, 독일의 동부 위성국들에서는 민족주의가 퍼져 제국에서 떠나가기를 원하고 있습니다. 1936년, 독일은 갈림길에 서있고, 우리는 과거의 적들이 예전의 힘을 되찾는 동안 강대한 제국이 이미 금이 가고 있는 것을 보았습니다..."

### Commune of France ###
FRA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "제3공화국은 자신이 시작된 것과 같은 방식으로 끝났습니다: 독일군에게 패배했고, 본국에서 혁명을 맞이했습니다. 1919년, CGT에 의해 시작된 총파업은 부르주아 정부의 몰락을 초래했습니다. 15년 동안, 새로운 '프랑스 코뮌'은 공안위원회를 비롯한 생디칼리슴-사회주의 사이의 합의의 발판 위에서 단결할 수 있었습니다. 하지만 1936년, 국가를 재건하고 혁명을 수호해야할 필요성은 많은 비판자들에게 낡아빠진 것으로 여겨지고 있고 보다 급진적인 정책에 대한 요구가 커지고 있습니다. 프랑스는 자신의 사명에 확신을 가지고 있지만, 앞으로 어떤 혁명 분파가 권력을 장악할 지는 불분명합니다..."

### Union of Britain ###
ENG_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "1921년 '명예로운 평화' 이후 세계대전은 끝났고, 본토에서 대중들의 신뢰와 지지는 사라졌습니다. 1925년, 재앙이 발생했습니다: 소규모 노동 쟁의가 TUC에 의한 총파업으로 빠르게 커졌고, 노동자들의 파업에 이어 군인들이 탈영하기 시작했습니다. 대규모 폭동의 발생 6주 후, 왕실과 대부분의 엘리트들은 캐나다로 도주했고 대신 새로운 노동조합총회가 정권을 장악했습니다. 현재 영국인들은 고립되어 사회주의를 구축하는데 만족하고 있지만, 캐나다의 왕당파들이 연방에 대해 음모를 꾸미는 것을 그냥 내버려 둘 수 없다고 많은 사람들이 생각하기 시작했습니다..."

### Canada ###
CAN_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "1925년 혁명 이후, 왕실과 영국인 망명자들은 캐나다로 피신했습니다. 보수당의 지원을 받아 그들은 본토를 되찾을 날을 꿈꾸며 준-공식적인 망명 정부를 설립했습니다. 하지만 모든 일이 잘 풀려가는 것은 아닙니다. RB 베넷의 보수당은 1935년의 선거에서 '진보주의자'들의 느슨한 연합으로 이제 과반수의 의석을 차지하고 영국 망명자들과 왕의 커져가는 영향력에 맞서 캐나다 의회의 주권을 확고히 하기 위해 노력하는 매켄지 킹의 자유당에게 패배했습니다. 세계의 정치 상황이 악화되면서, 국내외의 격렬한 갈등의 무대가 만들어졌습니다..."

### Russia ###
RUS_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "러시아 내전 동안, 백군은 가진 모든 것을 가지고 싸웠지만, 적군은 여전히 국가의 산업 중심부를 장악했었습니다. 하지만 독일 제국이 붉은 러시아를 두려워해 백군을 지원하며 개입하기로 결정했습니다. 2년 후, 모스크바와 페트로그라드는 백군에게 넘어갔고 새로운 러시아 공화국이 설립되었습니다. 지난 15년 동안, 여당인 사회혁명당과 입헌민주당의 불안한 연합은 케렌스키 대통령의 밑에서 러시아를 다스려왔지만, 러시아는 점차 불안정해지고 있습니다. 다른 정치 세력들이 성장하고 있으며, 그들은 세계에 러시아의 힘을 다시 보여주기 위해 변화할 시간이 지금이라고 생각하고 있습니다..."

### United States ###
USA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "고립주의를 자처하던 미합중국은 세계대전 당시 개입 쪽으로 정책이 기울 뻔 했지만, 결국에는 전쟁에서 벗어나 있었습니다. 이것은 동맹국의 승리로 이어졌습니다. 그 이후로, 미합중국은 유럽 무역 기회에 있어서 경제적으로 어려움을 겪어왔고 협상국의 빚 상환은 독일의 승리로 인해 불가능해졌습니다. 여전히 국제적으로 '아무 것도 아닌 곳'으로 여겨지는 미합중국은 커져가는 내부의 반대를 마주쳤는데, 공화당-민주당의 독주 체제가 두 단체에게 도전받았습니다 - 바로 생디칼리스트들과 미국 제일당입니다. 커져만 가는 본국에서의 위기와 해외에서의 긴장감은, 미합중국에게 좋지 않은 상황입니다..."

### Japan ###
JAP_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "'명예로운 평화'는 식민지에 대한 일본의 권리를 보장해줬지만, 욱일제국에서 모든 것이 잘 풀린 것은 아닙니다. 경제적 동요 이후 1926년 생디칼리스트의 히로히토 섭정-왕자 암살 시도로 그 극에 이르렀고, 불안정한 정부는 또다른 위기의 해를 보냈습니다; 첫 문제는 다나카 장군이었고, 다음은 민주 연립 내각이었으며 그 다음은 북동부 중국에 대한 개입이었습니다. 1936년, 일본은 제국을 확장할 태세를 취했습니다. 독일의 지배가 쇠퇴하고 있는 것으로 보이는 가운데, 일본인들은 남은 청나라의 영토와 독일의 태평양 지역들을 탐내고 있습니다..."

### Other Nations ###
OTHER_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "세계의 크고 작은 나라들이 그들의 때가 오기만을 기다리고 있습니다. 제국을 지키려는 주요 강대국에서부터, 세계대전에서 잃은 것을 되찾기 위해 노력하는 많은 국가들에 이르기까지, 이 모두는 미래에 영향력을 얻기 위해 어려운 결정들을 내리고 이상과 실용주의 사이에서 균형을 잡아야 할 것입니다..."

### Patagonian Workers Front ###
FOP_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Despite the belief that a revolution in the arid wastes of Patagonia would be impossible, the Frente Obrero Patagonico has managed to endure against all odds. Thanks to an opportune Chilean intervention forcing Argentina to accept the new status quo or face a war unprepared at a time of great economic hardship, the FOP has managed to grow in numbers, drawing people disillusioned with the old regime in Argentina. However, the ties that bind the different factions in the FOP are thinner than they look from afar, and perhaps victory in the civil war will only be the match that will set off the powder-keg..."

### Past Nations ###
####################

#### Costa Rica ###
#COS_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Class warfare, rapid militarisation and the Iron Grip of the Kaiser hold the world in its grasp, which makes it even more peculiar that in the midst of all this violence and pain we can find the tiny republic of Costa Rica. Taking great pride in their impressive literacy statistics and their unbreakable dedication to the Constitution, the nation stands as a rock above its neighbours who have long been eyeing its land. As their greatest ally starts to descend into chaos, vultures all across the Americas are waiting for the proud eagle to fall. Diplomacy will have to prevail if we are to survive the coming tide..."
#
#### Cuba ###
#CUB_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A mere seven years since the overthrow of American-backed dictator Gerardo Machado, Cuba again teeters on the edge of political upheaval. The regime of young President Rafael Trejo has steadily lost control over the Army and the civilian government's political authority has all but completely eroded. As radicals both right and left threaten the country, the military may well take full control as soon as an opportunity presents itself."
#
#### Denmark ###
#DEN_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Denmark exists under the shadow of Berlin. Its relation with the new hegemon of the world is ancient, has often been hostile, even as recently as 1864, which resulted in the loss of Slesvig to the Germans. Yet, in 1936, ties are warm and Denmark, by grace of having remained neutral in the Weltkrieg maintains its sovereignty in full. Under the guiding hand of the popular social democratic prime minister Thorvald Stauning, Denmark has been profiting off German economic prosperity. Domestically, the future looks bright, but internationally, clouds are gathering. Some fear Denmark will be in the wrong place at the wrong time..."
#
#### Dominican Republic ###
#DOM_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The American Occupation of the Dominican Republic ended in 1924 and full political control was returned soon after, but within a mere few years, the nation's new democratic constitution would face challenges both within and without. While Democracy has so far survived in the nation, the schism of the long-ruling Red Party has again put the constitution's survival in jeopardy."
#
#### Fengtian Government ###
#FNG_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Shanghai Conference of 1928 left Fengtian as the sole inheritor of the old Beiyang Republic's legacy. As before, democracy is maintained only as a thin veneer, and real power is divided between a wide variety of unscrupulous autocrats.\n\nZhang Zuolin, his ambitions limited by the stark realities of Qing strength and Japanese power, has been forced to walk a political tightrope above the machinations of his own divided government. The outlook is grim, but some still hold out hope. The Five Colour Flag may again flutter high above Beijing and across all China..."
#
#### Finland ###
#FIN_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In the northern periphery of Europe, Finland, the bastion of German influence in Scandinavia, proudly stands. Spawned out of the corpse of the Russian empire and with socialism threatening the nation at its inception, the kingdom has developed into a stalwart ally of Germany against the principles of socialism and the imperialistic hands of Russia. But after almost two decades of independence under the guiding hand of its monarch and the national coalition, unrest is festering: is Finland truly free or is German dominion merely a bit more subtle than that of the Tsars of old?"
#
#### Guatemala ###
#GUA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The overthrow of the two decade long president Manuel Estrada Cabrera in 1920 and the overthrow of the Unity Party afterwards has led to a decade long dictatorship under José María Orellana. Through various compromises he has been able to keep power by a string through the Americans and various outside influence. However, the rise of Sandino in Nicaragua has caused extreme trouble for his presidency as socialist movements begin to grow and the Unity Party officials begin to ally with elements of the military. Orellana's dictatorship might have its string cut soon."
#
#### Honduras ###
#HON_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The suicide of President Andino in 1933 following the peasant charge of the capital created a shock wave throughout Honduras, soon after a peasant republic was established with the goal of gradually rooting out US influence and purging Pro US elements. In 1936 the Council is on the brink of collapse and there are rumours of a conspiracy within the government..."
#
#### Iceland ###
#ICE_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Starting in 1874, Iceland had its first taste of independence when Denmark granted the colony home rule. When the guns fell silent after the Weltkrieg, Iceland joined the Mitteleuropa Economic Bloc which brought a period of prosperity to the island. However, this economic prosperity would not last forever. The British Revolution of 1925 shattered the miracle that post-Weltkrieg Iceland was experiencing. The last decade has seen Iceland floundering as its economy never fully recovered from the loss of Great Britain. Many politicians are now bringing forward further plans to revitalize the island."
#
#### Italian Republic ###
#ITA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After Italy's defeat in the Weltkrieg, the country was left to the mercy of the Austrians - and it would have been reorganized into the old Italian Federation had it not been for the outbreak of civil war. The socialists would have overrun the peninsula had the Austrians not swallowed a bitter pill and cooperated with the republicans... and, after the fighting stopped, was forced to maintain the relationship into the current day. Italy remains unstable, however, and its eventual reckoning with the socialists across the Po appears inevitable."
#
#### League of Eight Provinces ###
#LEP_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Sun Chuanfang's League forms the southern half of an axis which has dominated China for nearly a decade. Years of peace have proven fertile ground for ambition, and with it jealousy. Although Nanjing and Beijing remain united against external foes, they have become competitors as much as allies. Some say the costs of this contest have already begun to take their toll.\n\nLike much of China the League is the product of a careful balance, and Sun's great bureaucratic pyramid may have already begun to crack and crumble..."
#
#### Ma Clique ###
#XSM_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The three Ma families have cemented their north-western rule for thirty steady years. Siding with almost everyone in China at one point or another, with some Mas even fighting each other for the sake of remaining on the good side of everyone, the Mas are now seen as one of the greatest allies of the new Zhili-led Qing Dynasty.\n\nOf course, not all is well. Ma Fuxiang's heart attack three years ago shook the clique, and a sense of anxiety and unrest has slowly spread ever since. For now the north-west is peaceful, but its future is less certain than many might like to believe..."
#
#### Mexico ###
#MEX_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Mexico has come out through the Mexican Revolution changed. During the 1920s the presidencies of Álvaro Obregón and Adolfo de la Huerta would see improved relations with the United States of America while stabilizing the country from the revolution. The Great Depression in America has allowed Mexico to embrace the ideas of the Revolution which they have started when they elected Emaliano Zapata as President in 1932. Now with two years left in his term, and the revolution seemingly done, Zapata looks to plot the future course for Mexico."
#
#### Nicaragua ###
#NIC_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The occupation of Nicaragua by the United States Marines in 1926 ended in disaster as the liberal revolutionary general expelled them and set up his new 'Revolutionary Republic' within Nicaragua. It soon drifted towards a socialist attitude and underwent not insignificant development but it is not without its troubles. The expelling of large amounts of American companies has left a hole in the economy and the entire eastern side of the country is unofficially demilitarized after a stern warning of entering the region from the Americans. With the elections soon will Nicaragua's fate finally be changed?"
#
#### Norway ###
#NOR_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "For Norway, the last two decades could have been better. As a neutral country supportive of the British war effort, the hegemonic power of Germany did not favour the land of the midnight sun and the nation was excluded from the Mitteleuropa project that did include Sweden and Denmark. When Great Britain fell to the hammer and torch, the last trading partner of Norway that was not subject to heavy tariffs was an ocean away. Ever since, Norway found itself in diplomatic and economic isolation, and in the suffering this entails, the syndicalist-inclined Labour Party rises in the polls at an ever-increasing pace."
#
#### Papal State ###
#PAP_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the formation of a united Italy, it had seemed the time for the Papal States to have secular power was a thing of the past. Then came the collapse of the kingdom, and the civil war which followed, and central Italians once again turned to the Papacy and its Sicilian allies to help maintain stability. Now Pope Pius XI is ill, and on his deathbed he laments an Italy that remains divided, with the syndicalists growing ever stronger in the north. Whoever his successor is, he will need God on his side in order to prevail."
#
#### Qing Empire ###
#QIE_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Qing Empire enters 1936 on the brink. Restored in exchange for German support during the fourth Zhili-Fengtian war in 1927, the Xuantong Emperor remains deeply unpopular and viewed by many as illegitimate.\n\nThe Zhili clique, who trounced both the Fengtian clique and the KMT, stands as the victor of the chaos that engulfed China since 1911, but their domination of the country is far from secure. Enemies from both outside and within threaten their hegemony, and it remains to be seen how long they can hold on to power..."
#
#### Sardinia ###
#SRD_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The House of Savoy was shattered by Italy's defeat in the Weltkrieg, and King Victor Emmanuel III held responsible. All is not completely lost for the monarchy, however. The Savoy-Aostas are powerful supporters, the rightful holders of Sardinia-Piedmont until their lands on the shores were swallowed up by the syndicalists. Now they and what monarchy supporters they can gather hold out on Sardinia, protected by the French Republic and ready to watch for the opportunity where they, too, can one day return home to claim their seat of power."
#
#### Shandong ###
#SQI_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Shandong's ruler Zhang Zongchang is preceded only by his armored train and a monstrous reputation. The 'Dogmeat General' is known for violence, vice and corruption, and under his hand the capital of Jinan has steadily come to mirror its master.\n\nHowever, from the peak of Mount Tai, the elusive patriarch Zhang Tianran eschews the depravity below. Instead he hopes to turn back China’s clock by over a century, and guide the country into the arms of his captivating Yiguandao faith. A clash between these contradictory forces may change China forever..."
#
#### Shanxi Clique ###
#SHX_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Unlike most other warlord factions, Yan Xishan's Shanxi clique has retained a policy of guarded neutrality for nearly three decades, broken only in times of great threat or great opportunity. Both presented themselves in 1928, and Yan joined Zhang Zuolin against the newly reformed Qing Government.\n\nUnfortunately the subsequent defeat deprived Yan of the eastern portion of his province, and forced him to induct Guominjun remnants to bolster his wavering forces. The consequences of 1928 are far from forgotten, and next time Yan must choose a side he must do so wisely... "
#
#### Sichuan Clique ###
#SZC_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Sichuan has long been a microcosm of China's many woes, divided and constantly switching controllers since 1911. Yang Sen managed to emerge from the chaos as ruler with help from Wu Peifu's Zhili Clique, but even his control is far from absolute.\n\nFollowing a destructive Tibetan invasion, Yang has come to rely upon internal factions for support, most notably Liu Xiang's Industrial Corps and Deng Xihou's Baoding Department. Meanwhile, the exiled Officer Department has returned to the south with support from Yunnan. The Sichuanese powder-keg may explode once again..."
#
#### Socialist Republic Italy ###
#SRI_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since the Italian civil war, the Socialist Republic of Italy has controlled the bulk of Italy. Its rulers know full well that it would have overrun the republicans and the whites, had it not been for the infernal interference of Austria and the pressure applied by Germany. Even today, it is the spectre of interference by Germany and Austria which keeps syndicalism from finishing off the last remnants of Old Italy. The nation bides its time, building its strength, and is fully aware that - once the scale tips - it shall tip in the favour of revolution."
#
#### Sweden ###
#SWE_KR_GATHERING_STOR_DESC:0 "In the last decade, Sweden developed itself as a bastion of conservatism under the prosperous rule of prime minister Arvid Lindman, profiting from the fruits of the economic growth in Mitteleuropa during the late 1920s and early 1930s. However, clouds are gathering over Stockholm: in 1934, Arvid Lindman retired as prime minister, and has been succeeded by the less charismatic Gösta Bagge, while the social democratic opposition is rallying around their popular party leader Per Albin Hansson. This year Bagge's first elections as prime minister will be held. Can he hold his ground? And if not, can Sweden's democracy survive this sudden reversal?"
#
#### Two Sicilies ###
#SIC_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies initially sided with Austria during the civil war, a necessary evil to halt the advance of the Socialist Republic. Later, however, when war with the syndicalists seemed inevitable, the Austrians showed their true colours and abandoned the south. The war never happened, but the Sicilains came into the modern era wiser. They will have a difficult time meeting the more industrialized north head on, but that war will someday came and they must be ready for it."
#
#### West Indies Federation ###
#CAF_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The West Indies Federation was created as a result of the collapse of the British Empire in 1925 due to being unable to exert the influence to control the region directly. After the incorporation of the French colonies in 1927 the country has been home to not only a noticeable class divide, but a cultural and ideological one as well. The people and new generation have seen a noticeable drift towards socialist attitudes and preference towards the communards on the mainland. All it could take is one wrong step before chaos erupts on the Indies..."
#
#### Yunnan Clique ###
#YUN_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the German re-establishment of the Qing dynasty, the mountainous border province of Yunnan was forced to change its strategy. Governor Tang decided to kowtow to the new Qing Empire, while at the same time opening Yunnan's doors to republican remnants, in order to cement his autonomy and deter action against his notoriously upstart province.\n\nAlthough the situation in China is slowly starting to favour Tang's schemes, it is also beginning to shatter an illusion of provincial unity, as many internal factions no longer see Tang as fit or even sane enough to rule..."
